In physics, absolute space and time may be a preferred frame.\n\nA version of the concept of absolute space (in the sense of a preferred frame) can be seen in Aristotelian physics. Robert S. Westman writes that a \"whiff\" of absolute space can be observed in Copernicus' classic work \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\", where Copernicus uses the concept of an immobile sphere of stars.\n\nOriginally introduced by Sir Isaac Newton in \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", the concepts of absolute time and space provided a theoretical foundation that facilitated Newtonian mechanics. According to Newton, absolute time and space respectively are independent aspects of objective reality:\n\nAbsolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...\n\nAccording to Newton, absolute time exists independently of any perceiver and progresses at a consistent pace throughout the universe. Unlike relative time, Newton believed absolute time was imperceptible and could only be understood mathematically. According to Newton, humans are only capable of perceiving relative time, which is a measurement of perceivable objects in motion (like the Moon or Sun). From these movements, we infer the passage of time.\n\nThese notions imply that absolute space and time do not depend upon physical events, but are a backdrop or stage setting within which physical phenomena occur. Thus, every object has an absolute state of motion relative to absolute space, so that an object must be either in a state of absolute rest, or moving at some absolute speed. To support his views, Newton provided some empirical examples: according to Newton, a solitary rotating sphere can be inferred to rotate about its axis relative to absolute space by observing the bulging of its equator, and a solitary pair of spheres tied by a rope can be inferred to be in absolute rotation about their center of gravity (barycenter) by observing the tension in the rope.\n\nAbsolute time and space continue to be used in classical mechanics, but modern formulations by authors such as Walter Noll and Clifford Truesdell go beyond the linear algebra of elastic moduli to use topology and functional analysis for non-linear field theories.\n\nHistorically, there have been differing views on the concept of absolute space and time. Gottfried Leibniz was of the opinion that space made no sense except as the relative location of bodies, and time made no sense except as the relative movement of bodies. George Berkeley suggested that, lacking any point of reference, a sphere in an otherwise empty universe could not be conceived to rotate, and a pair of spheres could be conceived to rotate relative to one another, but not to rotate about their center of gravity, an example later raised by Albert Einstein in his development of general relativity.\n\nA more recent form of these objections was made by Ernst Mach. Mach's principle proposes that mechanics is entirely about relative motion of bodies and, in particular, mass is an expression of such relative motion. So, for example, a single particle in a universe with no other bodies would have zero mass. According to Mach, Newton's examples simply illustrate relative rotation of spheres and the bulk of the universe.\n\nWhen, accordingly, we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity \"in space\", our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to \"the entire universe\".—Ernst Mach; as quoted by Ciufolini and Wheeler: \"Gravitation and Inertia\", p. 387\n\nThese views opposing absolute space and time may be seen from a modern stance as an attempt to introduce operational definitions for space and time, a perspective made explicit in the special theory of relativity.\n\nEven within the context of Newtonian mechanics, the modern view is that absolute space is unnecessary. Instead, the notion of inertial frame of reference has taken precedence, that is, a preferred \"set\" of frames of reference that move uniformly with respect to one another. The laws of physics transform from one inertial frame to another according to Galilean relativity, leading to the following objections to absolute space, as outlined by Milutin Blagojević:\nNewton himself recognized the role of inertial frames.\n\nThe motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among themselves, whether that space is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a straight line.\n\nAs a practical matter, inertial frames often are taken as frames moving uniformly with respect to the fixed stars. See Inertial frame of reference for more discussion on this.\n\nThe concepts of space and time were separate in physical theory prior to the advent of special relativity theory, which connected the two and showed both to be dependent upon the reference frame's motion. In Einstein's theories, the ideas of absolute time and space were superseded by the notion of spacetime in special relativity, and curved spacetime in general relativity.\n\nAbsolute simultaneity refers to the concurrence of events in time at different locations in space in a manner agreed upon in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity does not have a concept of absolute time because there is a relativity of simultaneity. An event that is simultaneous with another event in one frame of reference may be in the past or future of that event in a different frame of reference, which negates absolute simultaneity.\n\nQuoted below from his later papers, Einstein identified the term aether with \"properties of space\", a terminology that is not widely used. Einstein stated that in general relativity the \"aether\" is not absolute anymore, as the geodesic and therefore the structure of spacetime depends on the presence of matter.\n\nSpecial relativity eliminates absolute time (although Gödel and others suspect absolute time may be valid for some forms of general relativity) and general relativity further reduces the physical scope of absolute space and time through the concept of geodesics. There appears to be absolute space in relation to the distant stars because the local geodesics eventually channel information from these stars, but it is not necessary to invoke absolute space with respect to any system's physics, as its local geodesics are sufficient to describe its spacetime.\n\n"}

The motivations of the abuser are varied, such as personal gain, personal gratification, psychological projection, devaluation, envy or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.\n\nControlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse. The goal of the abuser is to control and intimidate the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.\n\nManipulators and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including positive reinforcement (such as praise, superficial charm, flattery, ingratiation, love bombing, smiling, gifts, attention), negative reinforcement, intermittent or partial reinforcement, psychological punishment (such as nagging, silent treatment, swearing, threats, intimidation, emotional blackmail, guilt trips, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as verbal abuse or explosive anger).\n\nThe vulnerabilities of the victim are exploited with those who are particularly vulnerable being most often selected as targets. Traumatic bonding can occur between the abuser and victim as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change and a climate of fear. An attempt may be made to normalise, legitimise, rationalise, deny, or minimise the abusive behaviour, or blame the victim for it.\n\nIsolation, gaslighting, mind games, lying, disinformation, propaganda, destabilisation and divide and rule are other strategies that are often used. The victim may be plied with alcohol or drugs to help disorientate them.\n\nCertain personality types feel particularly compelled to control other people.\n\nIn the study of personality psychology, certain personality disorders display characteristics involving the need to gain compliance or control over others: \n\nControl freaks are often perfectionists defending themselves against their own inner vulnerabilities in the belief that if they are not in total control they risk exposing themselves once more to childhood angst. Such persons manipulate and pressure others to change so as to avoid having to change themselves, and use power over others to escape an inner emptiness. When a control freak's pattern is broken, the controller is left with a terrible feeling of powerlessness but feeling their pain and fear brings them back to themselves.\n\nIn terms of personality-type theory, control freaks are very much the Type A personality, driven by the need to dominate and control. An obsessive need to control others is also associated with antisocial personality disorder.\n\nBraiker identified the following ways that manipulators control their victims:\n\nManipulators may have:\n\nEmotional blackmail is a term coined by psychotherapist Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that fear, obligation and guilt (FOG) are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics are useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.\n\nForward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:\nThere are different levels of demands - demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.\n\nThe silent treatment is sometimes used as a control mechanism. When so used, it constitutes a passive-aggressive action characterized by the coupling of nonverbal but nonetheless unambiguous indications of the presence of negative emotion with the refusal to discuss the scenario triggering those emotions and, when those emotions' source is unclear to the other party, occasionally the refusal to clarify it or even to identify that source at all. As a result, the perpetrator of the silent treatment denies the victim both the opportunity to negotiate an after-the-fact settlement of the grievance in question and the ability to modify his/her future behavior to avoid giving further offense. In especially severe cases, even if the victim gives in and accedes to the perpetrator's initial demands, the perpetrator may continue the silent treatment so as to deny the victim feedback indicating that those demands have been satisfied. The silent treatment thereby enables its perpetrator to cause hurt, obtain ongoing attention in the form of repeated attempts by the victim to restore dialogue, maintain a position of power through creating uncertainty over how long the verbal silence and associated impossibility of resolution will last, and derive the satisfaction that the perpetrator associates with each of these consequences.\n\nThe expression has been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims, as well as to describe the behavior of an abusive narcissist who tries to win the confidence of a victim.\n\nOne sense of mind games is a largely conscious struggle for psychological one-upmanship, often employing passive–aggressive behavior to specifically demoralize or dis-empower the thinking subject, making the aggressor look superior; also referred to as \"power games\".\n\nIn intimate relationships, mind games can be used to undermine one partner's belief in the validity of their own perceptions. Personal experience may be denied and driven from memory; and such abusive mind games may extend to denial of the victim's reality, social undermining, and the trivializing of what is felt to be important. Both sexes have equal opportunities for such verbal coercion, which may be carried out unconsciously as a result of the need to maintain one's own self-deception.\n\nA primary strategy the narcissist uses to assert control, particularly within their family, is to create divisions among individuals. This weakens and isolates them, making it easier for the narcissist to manipulate and dominate. Some are favoured, others are scapegoated. Such dynamics can play out in a workplace setting.\n\nThe power and control \"wheel\" was developed in 1982 by the Domestic Abuse Program in Minneapolis to explain the nature of abuse, to delineate the forms of abuse used to control another person, and to educate people with the goal of stopping violence and abuse. The model is used in many batterer intervention programs, and is known as the Duluth model. Power and control is generally present with violent physical and sexual abuse.\n\nOften the abusers are initially attentive, charming and loving, gaining the trust of the individual that will ultimately become the victim, also known as the survivor. When there is a connection and a degree of trust, the abusers become unusually involved in their partner's feelings, thoughts and actions. Next, they set petty rules and exhibit \"pathological jealousy\". A conditioning process begins with alternation of loving followed by abusive behavior. According to \"Counselling Survivors of Domestic Abuse\", \"These serve to confuse the survivor leading to potent conditioning processes that impact on the survivor's self-structure and cognitive schemas.\" The abuser projects responsibility for the abuse on to the victim, or survivor, and the denigration and negative projections become incorporated into the survivor's self-image.\n\nTraumatic bonding occurs as the result of ongoing cycles of abuse in which the intermittent reinforcement of reward and punishment creates powerful emotional bonds that are resistant to change.\n\nControlling abusers use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their partners. According to Jill Cory and Karen McAndless-Davis, authors of \"When Love Hurts: A Woman's Guide to Understanding Abuse in Relationships\": Each of the tactics within the power and control wheel are used to \"maintain power and control in the relationship. No matter what tactics your partner uses, the effect is to control and intimidate you or to influence you to feel that you do not have an equal voice in the relationship.\"\n\nA tool for exerting control and power is the use of threats and coercion. The victim may be subject to threats that they will be left, hurt, or reported to welfare. The abuser may threaten that they will commit suicide. They may also coerce them to perform illegal actions or to drop charges that they may have against their abuser. Strangulation, a particularly pernicious abusive behavior in which the abuser literally has the victim’s life in his hands, is an extreme form of abusive control. Sorenson and colleagues have called strangulation the domestic violence equivalent of waterboarding, which is widely considered to be a form of torture.\n\nAt its most effective, the abuser creates intimidation and fear through unpredictable and inconsistent behavior. Absolute control may be sought by any of four types of sadists: explosive, enforcing, tyrannical, or spineless sadists. The victims are at risk of anxiety, dissociation, depression, shame, low self-esteem and suicidal ideation.\n\nAbused individuals may be intimidated by the brandishing of weapons, destruction of their property or other things, or use of gestures or looks to create fear. For example, threatening to use a gun or simply displaying the weapon is a form of intimidation and coercive control.\n\nAn effective means of ensuring control and power over another is to control their access to money. One method is to prevent the abusee from getting or retaining a job. Controlling their access to money can also be done by withholding information and access to family income, taking their money, requiring the person to ask for money, giving them an allowance, or filing a power of attorney or conservatorship, particularly in the case of economic abuse of the elderly.\n\nEmotional abuse include name-calling, playing mind games, putting the victim down, or humiliating the individual. The goals are to make the person feel bad about themselves, feel guilty or think that they are crazy.\n\nAnother element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world. Isolation includes controlling a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go, and any other method to limit their access to others. It may also include limiting what material is read. It can include insisting on knowing where they are and requiring permission for medical care. The abuser exhibits hypersensitive and reactive jealousy.\n\nThe abuser may deny the abuse occurred to attempt to place the responsibility for their behavior on the victim. Minimizing concerns or the degree of the abuse is another aspect of this control.\n\nChildren may be used to exert control by the abuser threatening to take the children or making them feel guilty about the children. It could include harassing them during visitation or using the children to relay messages. Another controlling tactic is abusing pets.\n\nUsing \"privilege\" means that the abuser defines the roles in the relationship, makes the important decisions, treats the individual like a servant and acts like the \"master of the castle\".\n\nA power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:\n\nAn essential prerequisite of bullying is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of social or physical power.\n\nThe authors of the book \"\" describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power:\n\nAccording to anti-bullying author and activist Tim Field, bullies are attracted to the caring professions, such as medicine, by the opportunities to exercise power over vulnerable clients, and over vulnerable employees and students.\n\nInstitutional abuse is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) from a system of power. This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and hunger, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.\n\nThe use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of psychological stress induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination. During the initiation phase, traffickers use foot-in-the-door techniques of persuasion to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This manipulation creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker. Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.\n\nThe goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of learned helplessness for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives. Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in isolation, or withhold food or sleep. During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, guilt and self-blame, anger and rage, and sleep disturbances, PTSD, numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.\n\nChildren are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking because they are so young. In order to gain complete control of the child, traffickers often destroy physical and mental health of the children through persistent physical and emotional abuse. Stockholm syndrome is also a common problem for girls while they are trafficked, which can hinder them from both trying to escape, and moving forward in psychological recovery programs.\n\nOppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.\n\nThe practice of repression in Zersetzung comprised extensive and secret methods of control and psychological manipulation, including personal relationships of the target, for which the Stasi relied on its network of informal collaborators, (in German \"inoffizielle Mitarbeiter\" or \"IM\"), the State's power over institutions, and on operational psychology. Using targeted psychological attacks the Stasi tried to deprive a dissident of any chance of a \"hostile action\".\n\nThe main objective for one type of serial killer is to gain and exert power over their victim. Such killers are sometimes abused as children, leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. Many power- or control-motivated killers sexually abuse their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim. (See article causes of sexual violence for the differences regarding anger rape, power rape, and sadistic rape.) Ted Bundy is an example of a power/control-oriented serial killer. He traveled around the United States seeking women to control.\n\nIn December 2015, controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship was made illegal in England and Wales.\n\n"}

Androdioecy is rare in comparison to the other major reproductive systems: dioecy, gynodioecy and hermaphroditism. In animals, androdioecy has been considered an important stepping stone in the transition from dioecy to hermaphroditism, and vice versa.\n\nThe fitness requirements for androdioecy to arise and sustain itself are theoretically so improbable that it was long considered that such systems do not exist. Particularly, males and hermaphrodites have to have the same fitness, in other words the same number of offspring, in order to be maintained. However, males only have offspring by fertilizing eggs or ovules of hermaphrodites, while hermaphrodites have offspring both through fertilizing eggs or ovules of other hermaphrodites and their own ovules. This means that all else being equal, males have to fertilize twice as many eggs or ovules as hermaphrodites to make up for the lack of female reproduction.\n\nAndrodioecy can evolve either from dioecious ancestors through the invasion of hermaphrodites or from hermaphroditic ancestors through the invasion of males. The ancestral state is important because conditions under which androdioecy can evolve differ significantly.\n\nIn roundworms, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp and cancrid shrimps, androdioecy has evolved from dioecy. In these systems, hermaphrodites can only fertilize their own eggs (self-fertilize) and do not mate with other hermaphrodites. Males are the only means of outcrossing. Hermaphrodites may be beneficial in colonizing new habitats, because a single hermaphrodite can generate many other individuals. In the well-studied roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, males are very rare and only occur in populations that are in bad condition or stressed.\n\nIn animals, corals (phyla Cnidaria) and barnacles (Subphyla Crustacea), androdioecy has evolved from hermaphroditism. Many plants self-fertilize, and males may be sustained in a population when inbreeding depression is severe because males guarantee outcrossing.\n\nDespite their unlikely evolution, 115 androdioecious animal and about 50 androdioecious plant species are known. These species include\n\n\nRhabditidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nDiplogastridae (Order Rhabditida)\nSteinernematidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nAllanotnematidae (Order Rhabditida)\n\nDorylaimida\n\n\nClam shrimp\n\nTadpole shrimp\n\nBarnacles\n\nLysmata\n\nInsects\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792", "title": "Anthropic principle", "text": "Anthropic principle\n\nThe anthropic principle is a philosophical consideration that observations of the universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.\nThe strong anthropic principle (SAP) as explained by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life emerge within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak anthropic principle (WAP) similar to the one defined by Brandon Carter, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of selection bias (specifically survivor bias): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the multiverse for there to be a statistical population of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of \"only\" this universe, compatible with \"our\" life) could occur.\n\nThe principle was formulated as a response to a series of observations that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on Earth. The anthropic principle states that this is a necessity, because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe \"some\" universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.\n\nThe term \"anthropic\" in \"anthropic principle\" has been argued to be a misnomer. While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require human life or some kind of carbon chauvinism. Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.\n\nThe anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking falsifiability and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, \"conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist\", is \"easy\" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a tautology or truism. However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.\n\nIn 1961, Robert Dicke noted that the age of the universe, as seen by living observers, cannot be random. Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a \"golden age\", neither too young nor too old. If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of\nmetallicity (levels of elements besides hydrogen and helium) especially carbon, by nucleosynthesis. Small rocky planets did not yet exist. If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the main sequence and would have turned into white dwarfs, aside from the dimmest red dwarfs, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired Dirac's varying-G theory.\n\nDicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the critical density needed to prevent the Big Crunch (the \"Dicke coincidences\" argument). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of baryonic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of dark matter account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a cosmological constant. Steven Weinberg gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the value particle physics predicts (this has been described as the \"worst prediction in physics\"). However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic inflation, which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.\n\nThe observed values of the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.\n\nThe phrase \"anthropic principle\" first appeared in Brandon Carter's contribution to a 1973 Kraków symposium honouring Copernicus's 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the Copernican Principle, which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the Universe. As Carter said: \"Although our situation is not necessarily \"central\", it is inevitably privileged to some extent.\" Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the Perfect Cosmological Principle, which states that all large regions \"and times\" in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the steady-state theory, which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the Big Bang).\n\nCarter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a \"weak\" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged spacetime locations in the universe, and a more controversial \"strong\" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.\n\nRoger Penrose explained the weak form as follows:\n\nOne reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make \"predictions\" about the parameters. But second, \"as a last resort\", we can convert these predictions into \"explanations\" by assuming that there \"is\" more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the multiverse (\"world ensemble\" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a selection effect, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: \"why do the fundamental laws of physics take the particular form we observe and not another?\"\n\nSince Carter's 1973 paper, the term \"anthropic principle\" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" by John D. Barrow and Frank Tipler, published that year which distinguished between \"weak\" and \"strong\" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.\n\nCarter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: \"Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man.\" In 1957, Robert Dicke wrote: \"The age of the Universe 'now' is not random but conditioned by biological factors [...] [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem.\"\n\nWeak anthropic principle (WAP) (Carter): \"[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is \"necessarily\" privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers.\" Note that for Carter, \"location\" refers to our location in time as well as space.\n\nStrong anthropic principle (SAP) (Carter): \"[T]he universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase Descartes, \"cogito ergo mundus talis est\".\"<br>The Latin tag (\"I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]\") makes it clear that \"must\" indicates a deduction from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a truism.\n\nIn their 1986 book, \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\", John Barrow and Frank Tipler depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:\n\nWeak anthropic principle (WAP) (Barrow and Tipler): \"The observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so.\"<br>Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just \"observers\". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the fine structure constant, the number of spacetime dimensions, and the cosmological constant—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.\n\nStrong anthropic principle (SAP) (Barrow and Tipler): \"The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history.\"<br>This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the \"must\" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:\n\nThe philosophers John Leslie and Nick Bostrom reject the Barrow and Tipler SAP as a fundamental misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for \"anthropic bias\"—that is, the bias created by anthropic selection effects (which Bostrom calls \"observation\" selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:\n\nStrong self-sampling assumption (SSSA) (Bostrom): \"Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its reference class.\"<br> Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of \"observer-moments\" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate \"reference class\": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.\n\nAccording to Jürgen Schmidhuber, the anthropic principle essentially just says that the conditional probability of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as \"gravity won't change tomorrow\". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the prior distribution of alternative universes are necessary.\n\nPlaywright and novelist Michael Frayn describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book \"The Human Touch\", which explores what he characterises as \"the central oddity of the Universe\":\n\nCarter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the \"fundamental parameters\"—that is, the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the Big Bang. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is fine tuned to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that \"there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions\". If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the \"typical\" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.\n\nAlthough philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by Max Tegmark. An important development in the 1980s was the combination of inflation theory with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by symmetry breaking in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as \"fundamental constants\" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the string landscape emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a theory of everything having no free parameters. As Einstein said: \"What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world.\" In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a \"theory of everything\", string theory, proclaimed \"the end of the anthropic principle\" since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see below).\n\nThe modern form of a design argument is put forth by intelligent design. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the fine-tuning observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, Sober (2005) and Ikeda and Jefferys, argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see fine-tuned universe.\n\nPaul Davies's book \"The Goldilocks Enigma\" (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:\n\nOmitted here is Lee Smolin's model of cosmological natural selection, also known as \"fecund universes\", which proposes that universes have \"offspring\" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).\n\nClearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).\n\nThe anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983) inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account cosmological and astrophysical considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the age of the universe, the evolutionary chain culminating in \"Homo sapiens\" probably admits only one or two low probability links.\n\nNo possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is \"required\" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in \"our\" portion of \"this\" universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.\n\nPhilosopher John Leslie states that the Carter SAP (with multiverse) predicts the following:\n\nHogan has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe \"not\" to support life.\n\nProbabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:\nThe probability of observing value \"X\" is then proportional to \"N\"(\"X\") \"P\"(\"X\"). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be \"over-tuned\", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the cosmological constant can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.\n\nOne thing that would \"not\" count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence that the Earth or the solar system occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the Copernican principle (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see Copernican principle), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a necessary condition for our existence as observers.\n\nFred Hoyle may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on carbon-12 atoms, that there must be an undiscovered resonance in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the triple-alpha process. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million electronvolts. Willie Fowler's research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.\n\nHowever, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.\n\nDon Page criticized the entire theory of cosmic inflation as follows. He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic arrow of time in a universe with a Big Bang origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the entropy of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. Paul Davies rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle. While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any \"ad hoc\" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.\n\nString theory predicts a large number of possible universes, called the \"backgrounds\" or \"vacua\". The set of these vacua is often called the \"multiverse\" or \"anthropic landscape\" or \"string landscape\". Leonard Susskind has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.\n\nSteven Weinberg believes the Anthropic Principle may be appropriated by cosmologists committed to nontheism, and refers to that Principle as a \"turning point\" in modern science because applying it to the string landscape \" [...] may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator\". Others—most notably David Gross but also Lubos Motl, Peter Woit, and Lee Smolin—argue that this is not predictive. Max Tegmark, Mario Livio, and Martin Rees argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.\n\nJürgen Schmidhuber (2000–2002) points out that Ray Solomonoff's theory of universal inductive inference and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some prior distribution on the set of possible explanations of the universe.\n\nThere are two kinds of dimensions, spatial (bidirectional) and temporal (unidirectional). Let the number of spatial dimensions be \"N\" and the number of temporal dimensions be \"T\". That \"N\" = 3 and \"T\" = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by string theory and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting \"N\" differ from 3 and \"T\" differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue. \n\nThe implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who in the Discourse on Metaphysics suggested that the world is Immanuel Kant argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square law of universal gravitation. While Kant's argument is historically important, John D. Barrow says that it \"[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa\" (Barrow 2002: 204).\n\nIn 1920, Paul Ehrenfest showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the orbit of a planet about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its galaxy. Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a wave impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are formula_1 spatial dimensions, where \"k\" is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, Hermann Weyl showed that Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism works only with three dimensions of space and one of time. Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron orbitals around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the nucleus or disperse.\n\nMax Tegmark expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner. If \"T\" differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant partial differential equations. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if \"T\" > 1, Tegmark maintains that protons and electrons would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If \"N\" < 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when \"N\" < 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.\n\nIn general, it is not clear how physical law could function if \"T\" differed from 1. If \"T\" > 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like geodesics would not be necessarily maximal. \"N\" = 1 and \"T\" = 3 has the peculiar property that the speed of light in a vacuum is a \"lower bound\" on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of tachyons. \n\nHence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except \"N\" = 3 and \"T\" = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.\n\nSome of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back Teilhard de Chardin's earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare Omega Point), expressing a \"creatio evolutiva\" instead the elder notion of \"creatio continua\". From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology. Karl W. Giberson has been sort of laconic in stating that\n\nA thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\" by John D. Barrow, a cosmologist, and Frank J. Tipler, a cosmologist and mathematical physicist. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical astrophysics, it also touches on quantum physics, chemistry, and earth science. An entire chapter argues that \"Homo sapiens\" is, with high probability, the only intelligent species in the Milky Way.\n\nThe book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the history of ideas the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of teleology and intelligent design. They discuss the writings of Fichte, Hegel, Bergson, and Alfred North Whitehead, and the Omega Point cosmology of Teilhard de Chardin. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish teleological reasoning from \"eutaxiological\" reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.\n\nSeeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the final anthropic principle (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.\n\nBarrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and \"closely connected with moral values\". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the universe, constraints developed further in Tipler's \"The Physics of Immortality\". One such constraint is that the universe must end in a big crunch, which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about dark energy, based on observations of very distant supernovas.\n\nIn his review of Barrow and Tipler, Martin Gardner ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):\n\nCarter has frequently regretted his own choice of the word \"anthropic\", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general. Others have criticised the word \"principle\" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of selection effects.\n\nA common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy deus ex machina which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: \"[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts.\"\n\nCarter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as truisms or trivial tautologies—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their logical form (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying \"if things were different, they would be different\", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.\n\nCritics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.\n\nMany criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's \"anthropic cosmological principle\", which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a \"necessary prerequisite\" for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.\n\nSome applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called \"carbon chauvinism\", see also alternative biochemistry). The range of fundamental physical constants consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a fine tuned universe have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a weakless universe in which the weak nuclear force is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other fundamental interactions, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nLee Smolin has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his fecund universes theory, which assumes universes have \"offspring\" through the creation of black holes whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.\n\nThe philosophers of cosmology John Earman, Ernan McMullin, and Jesús Mosterín contend that \"in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation\". A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed \"anthropic\" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3942", "title": "Bijection", "text": "Bijection\n\nIn mathematics, a bijection, bijective function, or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set \"X\" to a set \"Y\".\n\nA bijection from the set \"X\" to the set \"Y\" has an inverse function from \"Y\" to \"X\". If \"X\" and \"Y\" are finite sets, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For infinite sets the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.\n\nA bijective function from a set to itself is also called a \"permutation\".\n\nBijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of isomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, permutation group, and projective map.\n\nFor a pairing between \"X\" and \"Y\" (where \"Y\" need not be different from \"X\") to be a bijection, four properties must hold:\n\nSatisfying properties (1) and (2) means that a bijection is a function with domain \"X\". It is more common to see properties (1) and (2) written as a single statement: Every element of \"X\" is paired with exactly one element of \"Y\". Functions which satisfy property (3) are said to be \"onto \"Y\" \" and are called surjections (or surjective functions). Functions which satisfy property (4) are said to be \"one-to-one functions\" and are called injections (or injective functions). With this terminology, a bijection is a function which is both a surjection and an injection, or using other words, a bijection is a function which is both \"one-to-one\" and \"onto\".\n\nBijections are sometimes denoted by a two-headed rightwards arrow with tail (), as in \"f\" : \"X\" ⤖ \"Y\". This symbol is a combination of the two-headed rightwards arrow () sometimes used to denote surjections and the rightwards arrow with a barbed tail () sometimes used to denote injections.\n\nConsider the batting line-up of a baseball or cricket team (or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line-up). The set \"X\" will be the players on the team (of size nine in the case of baseball) and the set \"Y\" will be the positions in the batting order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The \"pairing\" is given by which player is in what position in this order. Property (1) is satisfied since each player is somewhere in the list. Property (2) is satisfied since no player bats in two (or more) positions in the order. Property (3) says that for each position in the order, there is some player batting in that position and property (4) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list.\n\nIn a classroom there are a certain number of seats. A bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated. After a quick look around the room, the instructor declares that there is a bijection between the set of students and the set of seats, where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in. What the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that:\nThe instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students, without having to count either set.\n\n\nA bijection \"f\" with domain \"X\" (indicated by \"f\": \"X → Y\" in functional notation) also defines a converse relation starting in \"Y\" and going to \"X\" (by turning the arrows around). The process of \"turning the arrows around\" for an arbitrary function does not, \"in general\", yield a function, but properties (3) and (4) of a bijection say that this inverse relation is a function with domain \"Y\". Moreover, properties (1) and (2) then say that this inverse \"function\" is a surjection and an injection, that is, the inverse function exists and is also a bijection. Functions that have inverse functions are said to be invertible. A function is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.\n\nStated in concise mathematical notation, a function \"f\": \"X → Y\" is bijective if and only if it satisfies the condition\n\nContinuing with the baseball batting line-up example, the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order. Since this function is a bijection, it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position.\n\nThe composition formula_3 of two bijections \"f\": \"X → Y\" and \"g\": \"Y → Z\" is a bijection. The inverse of formula_3 is formula_5.\nConversely, if the composition formula_3 of two functions is bijective, we can only say that \"f\" is injective and \"g\" is surjective.\n\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are finite sets, then there exists a bijection between the two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" if and only if \"X\" and \"Y\" have the same number of elements. Indeed, in axiomatic set theory, this is taken as the definition of \"same number of elements\" (equinumerosity), and generalising this definition to infinite sets leads to the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.\n\n\nBijections are precisely the isomorphisms in the category Set of sets and set functions. However, the bijections are not always the isomorphisms for more complex categories. For example, in the category Grp of groups, the morphisms must be homomorphisms since they must preserve the group structure, so the isomorphisms are \"group isomorphisms\" which are bijective homomorphisms.\n\nThe notion of one-to-one correspondence generalizes to partial functions, where they are called partial bijections, although partial bijections are only required to be injective. The reason for this relaxation is that a (proper) partial function is already undefined for a portion of its domain; thus there is no compelling reason to constrain its inverse to be a total function, i.e. defined everywhere on its domain. The set of all partial bijections on a given base set is called the symmetric inverse semigroup.\n\nAnother way of defining the same notion is to say that a partial bijection from \"A\" to \"B\" is any relation \n\"R\" (which turns out to be a partial function) with the property that \"R\" is the graph of a bijection \"f\":\"A′\"→\"B′\", where \"A′\" is a subset of \"A\" and \"B′\" is a subset of \"B\".\n\nWhen the partial bijection is on the same set, it is sometimes called a one-to-one partial transformation. An example is the Möbius transformation simply defined on the complex plane, rather than its completion to the extended complex plane.\n\n\n\nThis topic is a basic concept in set theory and can be found in any text which includes an introduction to set theory. Almost all texts that deal with an introduction to writing proofs will include a section on set theory, so the topic may be found in any of these:\n\n"}

It is sometimes called a structure or aggregate data type, although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc. The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition.\n\nA codice_1 is C's and C++'s notion of a composite type, a datatype that composes a fixed set of labeled fields or members. It is so called because of the codice_1 keyword used in declaring them, which is short for \"structure\" or, more precisely, \"user-defined data structure\".\n\nIn C++, the only difference between a codice_1 and a class is the default access level, which is \"private\" for classes and \"public\" for codice_1s.\n\nNote that while classes and the codice_5 keyword were completely new in C++, the C programming language already had a crude type of codice_1s. For all intents and purposes, C++ codice_1s form a superset of C codice_1s: virtually all valid C codice_1s are valid C++ codice_1s with the same semantics.\n\nA codice_1 declaration consists of a list of fields, each of which can have any type. The total storage required for a codice_1 object is the sum of the storage requirements of all the fields, plus any internal padding.\n\nFor example:\ndefines a type, referred to as codice_13. To create a new variable of this type, we can write codice_14\nwhich has an integer component, accessed by codice_15, and a floating-point component, accessed by codice_16, as well as the codice_17 and codice_18 components. The structure codice_19 contains all four values, and all four fields may be changed independently.\n\nSince writing codice_13 repeatedly in code becomes cumbersome, it is not unusual to see a codice_21 statement in C code to provide a more convenient synonym for the codice_1.\n\nFor example:\nIn C++ code, the codice_21 is not needed because types defined using codice_1 are already part of the regular namespace, so the type can be referred to as either codice_13 or simply codice_26.\n\nAs another example, a three-dimensional Vector composite type that uses the floating point data type could be created with:\nA variable named codice_27 with a codice_28 composite type would be declared as codice_29 Members of the codice_27 would be accessed using a dot notation.

{"id": "633037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633037", "title": "Conceptualism", "text": "Conceptualism\n\nIn metaphysics, conceptualism is a theory that explains universality of particulars as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind. Intermediate between nominalism and realism, the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of universals from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them. Conceptualism is anti-realist about abstract objects, just like immanent realism is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).\n\nThe evolution of late scholastic terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective universality was distinctly defined as conceptualism.\n\nPeter Abélard was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things. William of Ockham was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no \"fundamentum\" outside the mind.\n\nIn the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the Jesuits: Hurtado de Mendoza, Rodrigo de Arriaga and Francisco Oviedo are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of Francisco Suárez, the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the early modern philosophy.\n\nConceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the early modern thinkers, including René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, George Berkeley, and David Hume – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.\n\nSometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our \"a priori\" mental structures and functions.\n\nIn late modern philosophy, conceptualist views were held by G. W. F. Hegel.\n\nEdmund Husserl's philosophy of mathematics has been construed as a form of conceptualism.\n\nConceptualist realism (a view put forward by David Wiggins in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.\n\nThough separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of \"Mind and World\" by John McDowell in 1994. McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that Wilfrid Sellars provided for what he called the \"Myth of the Given\"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data. Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for perceptual conceptualism, according to which perceptual content is conceptual \"from the ground up\", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's philosophy of justification is considered a form of foundationalism: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.\n\nA clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:\n\nI have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.\n\nMcDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not \"given\" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.\n\nThe application of the term \"perceptual conceptualism\" to Kant's philosophy of perception is debatable. Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed perceptual non-conceptualism.\n\n"}

During the communist era, Pešta became a part of the country's alternative culture scene and later earned a living as a graphic designer. After 2000, he finally left behind applied art and book illustrations and started to work exclusively with painting, from which he expanded into other forms of artistic expression. He spent two study trips in New York – one in 1998 and one in 2000.\n\nPešta has exhibited independently since 1992, and has participated in group exhibitions since 2000. Some of his most important projects include \"I was born in your bed\", held at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013 and \"Personal Structures (Nocturnal Head Records)\", held at the Palazzo Bembo on the occasion of 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 and in Palazzo Mora in 2017. In 2017 he was awarded the 2nd price in painting at London Art Biennale.\n\nHe is married to Dadja Altenburg-Kohl. His daughter Karolína Peštová-Matoušová studied art theory at Charles University in Prague.\n\nAlready in his youth, Pešta acquired an artistic dexterity and sense for material that he first applied in hyperrealistic painting. Nevertheless, he soon abandoned this approach in favor of a raw, expressive style more closely reflecting his nature. In 1998, Pešta went on his first study trip to New York. This contact with the international art scene radically influenced his work. He started to make use of diverse materials, experimenting with wax, leather, textiles, or recycled photographs as part of naturalistic assemblages. Since 2004, his favorite technique has been clear epoxy resin, which he uses to cover older paintings and objects, thus conserving and devaluating them all at once.\nOver time, he expanded his range of artistic approaches to include object installations, video art, and purely conceptual endeavors.\n\nIn his alarming conceptual project \"I was born in your bed\" (2013) – an exploration of Roma issues (i.e., how an individual's fate is predetermined by race) – Pešta sounds a warning bell.

{"id": "32036278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32036278", "title": "Dichotic listening", "text": "Dichotic listening\n\nDichotic listening or the Dichotic listening test is a psychological test commonly used to investigate selective attention within the auditory system and is a subtopic of cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Specifically, it is \"used as a behavioral test for hemispheric lateralization of speech sound perception.\" During a standard dichotic listening test, a participant is presented with two different auditory stimuli simultaneously (usually speech). The different stimuli are directed into different ears over headphones. Participants are asked to pay attention to one or both of the stimuli. Later, they are asked about the content of either the message they were asked to attend to or the message that they were not told to listen to. As a result of focusing to repeat the words, participants noticed little of the message to the other ear, often not even realizing that at some point it changed from English to German. At the same time, participants did notice when the voice in the unattended ear changed from a male's to a female's, suggesting that the selectivity of consciousness can work to tune in some information.\"\n\nDichotic listening also relates to the third basic property of consciousness: Selectivity which is the capacity to include some objects but not others.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s Donald Shankweiler and Michael Studdert-Kennedy of Haskins Laboratories used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables) to demonstrate the dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language and is typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. A dichotic listening performance advantage for one ear is interpreted as indicating a processing advantage in the contralateral hemisphere. In another example, Sidtis (1981) found that healthy adults have a left-ear advantage on a dichotic pitch recognition experiment. He interpreted this result as indicating right-hemisphere dominance for pitch discrimination.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Tim Rand demonstrated dichotic perception at Haskins Laboratories. In his study, the first stimuli: formant (F1), was presented to one ear while the second and third stimuli:(F2) and (F3) formants, were presented to the opposite ear. F2 and F3 varied in low and high intensity. Ultimately, in comparison to the binaural condition, \"peripheral masking is avoided when speech is heard dichotically.\" This demonstration was originally known as \"the Rand effect\" but was later renamed \"dichotic release from masking\". The name for this demonstration continued to evolve and was finally named \"dichotic perception\" or \"dichotic listening.\" Around the same time, Jim Cutting (1976), an investigator at Haskins Laboratories, researched how listeners could correctly identify syllables when different components of the syllable were presented to different ears. The formants of vowel sounds and their relation are crucial in differentiating vowel sounds. Even though the listeners heard two separate signals with neither ear receiving a 'complete' vowel sound, they could still identify the syllable sounds.\n\nThe \"dichotic fused words test\" (DFWT) is a modified version of the basic dichotic listening test. It was originally explored by Johnson \"et al.\" (1977) but in the early 80's Wexler and Hawles (1983) modified this original test to ascertain more accurate data pertaining to hemispheric specialization of language function. In the DFWT, each participant listens to pairs of monosyllabic rhyming consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words. Each word varies in the initial consonant. The significant difference in this test is \"the stimuli are constructed and aligned in such a way that partial interaural fusion occurs: subjects generally experience and report only one stimulus per trial.\" According to Zatorre (1989), some major advantages of this method include \"minimizing attentional factors, since the percept is unitary and localized to the midline\" and \"stimulus dominance effects may be explicitly calculated, and their influence on ear asymmetries assessed and eliminated.\" Wexler and Hawles study obtained a high test-retest reliability (r=0.85). High test-retest reliability is good, because it proves that the data collected from the study is consistent.\n\nAn emotional version of the dichotic listening task was developed. In this version individuals listen to the same word in each ear but they hear it in either a surprised, happy, sad, angry, or neutral tone. Participants are then asked to press a button indicating what tone they heard. Usually dichotic listening tests show a right-ear advantage for speech sounds. Right-ear/left-hemisphere advantage is expected, because of evidence from Broca's area and Wernicke's area, which are both located in the left hemisphere. In contrast, the left ear (and therefore the right hemisphere) is often better at processing nonlinguistic material. The data from the emotional dichotic listening task is consistent with the other studies, because participants tend to have more correct responses to their left ear than to the right. It is important to note that the emotional dichotic listening task is seemingly harder for the participants than the phonemic dichotic listening task. Meaning more incorrect responses were submitted by individuals.\n\nThe manipulation of voice onset time (VOT) during dichotic listening tests have given many insights regarding brain function. To date, the most common design is the utilisation of four VOT conditions: short-long pairs (SL), where a Consonant-Vowel (CV) syllable with a short VOT is presented to the left ear and a CV syllable with a long VOT is presented to the right ear, as well as long-short (LS), short-short (SS) and long-long (LL) pairs. In 2006, Rimol, Eichele, and Hugdahl first reported that in healthy adults SL pairs elicit the largest REA while, in fact, LS pairs elicit a significant left ear advantage (LEA). A study of children 5–8 years old has shown a developmental trajectory whereby long VOTs gradually start to dominate over short VOTs when LS pairs are being presented under dichotic conditions. Converging evidence from studies of attentional modulation of the VOT effect shows that around age 9 children lack the adult-like cognitive flexibility required to exert top-down control over stimulus-driven bottom-up processes. Arciuli et al.(2010) further demonstrated that this kind of cognitive flexibility is a predictor of proficiency with complex tasks such as reading.\n\nDichotic listening tests can also be used as lateralized speech assessment task. Neuropsychologists have used this test to explore the role of singular neuroanatomical structures in speech perception and language asymmetry. For example, Hugdahl \"et al.\" (2003), investigated dichotic listening performance and frontal lobe function in left and right lesioned frontal lobe nonaphasiac patients compared to healthy controls. In the study, all groups were exposed to 36 dichotic trials with pairs of CV syllables and each patient was asked to state which syllable he or she heard best. As expected, the right lesioned patients showed a right ear advantage like the healthy control group but the left hemisphere lesioned patients displayed impairment when compared to both the right lesioned patients and control group. From this study, researchers concluded \"dichotic listening as into a neuronal circuitry which also involves the frontal lobes, and that this may be a critical aspect of speech perception.\" Similarly, Westerhausen and Hugdahl (2008) analyzed the role of the corpus callosum in dichotic listening and speech perception. After reviewing many studies, it was concluded that \"...dichotic listening should be considered a test of functional inter-hemispheric interaction and connectivity, besides being a test of lateralized temporal lobe language function\" and \"the corpus callosum is critically involved in the top-down attentional control of dichotic listening performance, thus having a critical role in auditory laterality.\"\n\nDichotic listening can also be used to test the hemispheric asymmetry of language processing. In the early 60s, Doreen Kimura reported that dichotic verbal stimuli (specifically spoken numerals) presented to a participant produced a right ear advantage (REA). She attributed the right-ear advantage \"to the localization of speech and language processing in the so-called dominant left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex.\" According to her study, this phenomenon was related to the structure of the auditory nerves and the left-sided dominance for language processing. It is important to note that REA doesn't apply to non-speech sounds. In \"Hemispheric Specialization for Speech Perception,\" by Studdert-Kennedy and Shankweiler (1970) examine dichotic listening of CVC syllable pairs. The six stop consonants (b, d, g, p, t, k) are paired with the six vowels and a variation in the initial and final consonants are analyzed. REA is the strongest when the sound of the initial and final consonants differ and it is the weakest when solely the vowel is changed. Asbjornsen and Bryden (1996) state that \"many researchers have chosen to use CV syllable pairs, usually consisting of the six stop consonants paired with the vowel \\a\\. Over the years, a large amount of data has been generated using such material.\"\n\nIn selective attention experiments, the participants may be asked to repeat aloud the content of the message they are listening to. This task is known as shadowing. As Colin Cherry (1953) found, people do not recall the shadowed message well, suggesting that most of the processing necessary to shadow the attended to message occurs in working memory and is not preserved in the long-term store. Performance on the unattended message is worse. Participants are generally able to report almost nothing about the content of the unattended message. In fact, a change from English to German in the unattended channel frequently goes unnoticed. However, participants are able to report that the unattended message is speech rather than non-verbal content. In addition to this, if the content of the unattended message contains certain information, such as the listener's name, then the unattended message is more likely to be noticed and remembered. A demonstration of this was done by Conway, Cowen, and Bunting (2001) in which they had subjects shadow words in one ear while ignoring words in the other ear. At some point, the subject's name was spoken in the ignored ear, and the question was whether the subject would report hearing their name. Subjects with a high working memory (WM) span were more capable of blocking out the distracting information. Also if the message contains sexual words then people usually notice them immediately. This suggests that the unattended information is also undergoing analysis and keywords can divert attention to it.\n\nSome data gathered from dichotic listening test experiments suggests that there is possibly a small-population sex difference in perceptual and auditory asymmetries and language laterality. According to Voyer (2011), \"Dichotic listening tasks produced homogenous effect sizes regardless of task type (verbal, non-verbal), reflecting a significant sex difference in the magnitude of laterality effects, with men obtaining larger laterality effects than women.\" However, the authors discuss numerous limiting factors ranging from publication bias to small effect size. Furthermore, as discussed in \"Attention, reliability, and validity of perceptual asymmetries in the fused dichotic words test,\" women reported more \"intrusions\" or words presented to the uncued ear than men when presented with exogenous cues in the Fused Dichotic Word Task which suggests two possibilities: 1) Women experience more difficulty paying attention to the cued word than men and/or 2) regardless of the cue, women spread their attention evenly as opposed to men who may possibly focus in more intently on exogenous cues.\n\nA study conducted involving the dichotic listening test, with emphasis on subtypes of schizophrenia (particularly paranoid and undifferentiated), demonstrated that paranoid schizophrenics have the largest left hemisphere advantage – with undifferentiated schizophrenics (where psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met) having the smallest. The application of the dichotic listening test helped to further the beliefs that preserved left hemisphere processing is a product of paranoid schizophrenia, and in contrast, that the left hemisphere's lack of activity is a symptom of undifferentiated schizophrenia. In 1994, M.F. Green and colleagues tried to relate \"the functional integration of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic patients\" using a dichotic listening study. The study showed that auditory hallucinations are connected to a malfunction in the left hemisphere of the brain.\n\n"}

President Bill Clinton authorized extraordinary rendition to nations known to practice interrogation, which has been called on occasion torture by proxy. The administration of President George W. Bush rendered hundreds of illegal combatants for US detention, and transported detainees to US controlled sites as part of an extensive interrogation program that included torture. Extraordinary rendition continued under the Obama administration; with targets being interrogated and subsequently taken to the US for trial.\n\nThe United Nations considers one nation abducting the citizens of another a crime against humanity. In July 2014 the European Court of Human Rights condemned the government of Poland for participating in CIA extraordinary rendition, ordering Poland to pay restitution to men who had been abducted, taken to a CIA black site in Poland, and tortured.\n\nBy 2004, critics alleged that torture was used against subjects with the knowledge or acquiescence of the United States (a transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture is a violation of US law). In addition, some former detainees claimed to have been transferred to other countries for interrogation under torture, such as the Australian citizen Mamdouh Habib. In December 2005 Condoleezza Rice (then the United States Secretary of State) stated that:\n\n-- The United States has not transported anyone, and will not transport anyone, to a country when we believe he will be tortured. Where appropriate, the United States seeks assurances that transferred persons will not be tortured.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005 CIA officers captured an estimated 150 people and transported them around the world.\n\nUnder the Bush administration, rendered persons were reported to have undergone torture by the receiving countries. Journalists, civil and constitutional rights groups, and former detainees have alleged that this occurred with the knowledge or cooperation of the administrations of the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe revelations about the US program prompted several official investigations in Europe into alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states. A June 2006 report from the Council of Europe estimated 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA on EU territory (with the cooperation of Council of Europe members), and rendered to other countries, often after having transited through secret detention centers (\"black sites\") used by the CIA, some located in Europe. According to the separate European Parliament report of February 2007, the CIA has conducted 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture, in violation of article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. A large majority of the European Union Parliament endorsed the report's conclusion that many member states tolerated illegal actions by the CIA, and criticized several European governments and intelligence agencies for their unwillingness to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nWithin days of his inauguration in 2009, US President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order opposing rendition torture and established a task force to provide recommendations about processes to prevent rendition torture. While the Obama administration has distanced itself from some of the harshest counter-terrorism techniques, it has also said that at least some forms of renditions will continue. As of 2011, the administration allowed rendition only \"to a country with jurisdiction over that individual (for prosecution of that individual),\" when there is a diplomatic assurance \"that they will not be treated inhumanely.\"\n\nRendition, in law, is a transfer of persons from one jurisdiction to another, and the act of handing over, both after legal proceedings and according to law. \"Extraordinary rendition,\" however, is a rendition which is extralegal, i.e. outside the law (see: kidnapping). Rendition refers to the transfer; the apprehension, detention, interrogation, and any other practices occurring before and after the movement and exchange of extrajudicial prisoners do not fall into the strict definition of \"extraordinary rendition\". In practice, the term is widely used to describe such practices, particularly the initial apprehension. This latter usage extends to the transfer of suspected terrorists by the US to countries known to torture prisoners or to employ harsh interrogation techniques that may rise to the level of torture.\n\nThe Bush administration freely admitted to this practice; stating, among other provisions, that they have specifically asked that torture not be used. Torture can still occur, however, despite these provisions, and much documentation exists alleging that it has happened in many cases. In these instances, the initial captor allows the possibility of torture by releasing the prisoner into the custody of nations that practice torture.\n\nThe next distinction of degree is that of intent, where much of the search for evidence continues. It has been alleged that some of those detainees have been tortured with the knowledge, acquiescence, or even participation of US agencies. A transfer of anyone to anywhere for the purpose of torture would be a violation of US law. New York attorney Marc D. Falkoff stated that such evidence, i.e. transfer for the purposes of torture, was an operational practice. In a court filing, Falkoff described a classified prisoner transfer memo from Guantanamo as noting that information could not be retrieved, as torture could not be used, and recommending that the prisoner be sent to a nation that practiced torture.\n\nAn early case involves Israel's rendition of Adolf Eichmann from Argentina in 1960.\n\nThe first well-known American rendition case involved the \"Achille Lauro\" hijackers in 1985: after they were given a plane and were en route in international air space, they were forced by United States Navy fighter planes to land at the Naval Air Station Sigonella, an Italian military base in Sicily used by the US Navy and NATO. The US was trying to get them within judicial reach of United States government representatives for transport to and trial in the United States.\n\nIn September 1987, during the Reagan administration, the United States executed an extraordinary rendition, code named \"Goldenrod,\" in a joint FBI-CIA operation. Agents lured Fawaz Yunis, who was wanted in the U.S. courts for his role in the hijacking of a Jordanian airliner that had American citizens on board, onto a boat off the coast of Cyprus and taken to international waters, where he was arrested.\n\nThe Reagan administration did not undertake this kidnapping lightly. Then-FBI Director William H. Webster had opposed an earlier bid to snatch Yunis, arguing that the United States should not adopt the tactics of Israel, which had abducted Adolf Eichmann on a residential street in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1960 ... In 1984 and 1986, during a wave of terrorist attacks, Congress passed laws making air piracy and attacks on Americans abroad federal crimes. Ronald Reagan added teeth to these laws by signing a secret covert-action directive in 1986 that authorized the CIA to kidnap, anywhere abroad, foreigners wanted for terrorism. A new word entered the dictionary of U.S. foreign relations: rendition.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union alleges that extraordinary rendition was developed during the Clinton administration. CIA officials in the mid-1990s were trying to track down and dismantle militant Islamic organizations in the Middle East, particularly Al Qaeda.\n\nAccording to Clinton administration official Richard Clarke:\n\nBoth the Reagan and Clinton cases involved apprehending known terrorists abroad, by covert means if necessary. The Bush administration expanded the policy after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn a \"New Yorker\" interview with CIA veteran Michael Scheuer, an author of the rendition program under the Clinton administration, writer Jane Mayer noted,\n\nIn 1995, American agents proposed the rendition program to Egypt, making clear that it had the resources to track, capture, and transport terrorist suspects globally—including access to a small fleet of aircraft. Egypt embraced the idea ... 'What was clever was that some of the senior people in Al Qaeda were Egyptian,' Scheuer said. 'It served American purposes to get these people arrested, and Egyptian purposes to get these people back, where they could be interrogated.' Technically, U.S. law requires the CIA to seek 'assurances' from foreign governments that rendered suspects won't be tortured. Scheuer told me that this was done, but he was 'not sure' if any documents confirming the arrangement were signed.\n\nScheuer testified in 2007 before Congress that no such assurances were received. He acknowledged that treatment of prisoners may not have been \"up to U.S. standards.\" He stated,\n\nThis is a matter of no concern as the Rendition Program's goal was to protect America, and the rendered fighters delivered to Middle Eastern governments are now either dead or in places from which they cannot harm America. Mission accomplished, as the saying goes.\n\nThereafter, with the approval of President Clinton and a presidential directive (PDD 39), the CIA elected to send suspects to Egypt, where they were turned over to the Egyptian Mukhabarat.\n\nThe US has used rendition increasingly as a tool in the US-led \"war on terror\" to deal with foreign defendants, ignoring the normal extradition processes in international law. Modern methods of rendition include a form where suspects are taken into US custody but delivered to a third-party state, often without ever being on US soil, and without involving the rendering countries, termed \"extraordinary rendition.\" Hundreds of documents retrieved from Libyan foreign ministry offices in Tripoli following the 2011 Libyan civil war show that the CIA and the United Kingdom's MI6 rendered suspects to Libyan authorities knowing they would be tortured. The CIA was granted permission to use rendition (to the USA of indicted terrorists) in a presidential directive signed by US President Bill Clinton in 1995, following a procedure established by US President George H. W. Bush in January 1993.\n\nCritics have accused the CIA of rendering suspects to other countries in order to avoid US laws mandating due process and prohibiting torture. Critics have also called this practice \"torture flights\". Defenders of the practice argue that culturally informed and native-language interrogations are more successful in gaining information from suspects.\n\nIn a number of cases, suspects caught up in the procedure were found to be innocent. In the cases of Khalid El-Masri and Maher Arar, extraordinary rendition appears to have been used for innocent civilians, who also suffered lengthy detentions. The CIA has reportedly launched an investigation into such cases (which it refers to as \"erroneous rendition\").\n\nSociological comparisons have also been drawn between incidents of extraordinary rendition and the death flights procedure implemented, most notably, by Argentina during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nFollowing the 11 September 2001 attacks the United States, in particular the CIA, has been accused of rendering hundreds of people suspected by the government of being terrorists—or of aiding and abetting terrorist organizations—to third-party states such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Uzbekistan. Such \"ghost detainees\" are kept outside judicial oversight, often without ever entering US territory, and may or may not ultimately be transferred to the custody of the United States. According to the former CIA case officer Bob Baer, \"If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear—never to see them again—you send them to Egypt.\"\n\nAccording to a 4 December 2005 article in \"The Washington Post\" by Dana Priest:\n\nMembers of the Rendition Group follow a simple but standard procedure: Dressed head to toe in black, including masks, they blindfold and cut the clothes off their new captives, then administer an enema and sleeping drugs. They outfit detainees in a diaper and jumpsuit for what can be a day-long trip. Their destinations: either a detention facility operated by cooperative countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, or one of the CIA's own covert prisons—referred to in classified documents as \"black sites\", which at various times have been operated in eight countries, including several in Eastern Europe.\n\nFollowing mounting scrutiny in Europe, including investigations held by the Swiss senator Dick Marty who released a public report in June 2006, the US Senate, in December 2005, was about to approve a measure that would include amendments requiring the Director of National Intelligence to provide regular, detailed updates about secret detention facilities maintained by the United States overseas, and to account for the treatment and condition of each prisoner.\n\nMedia reports describe suspects as being arrested, blindfolded, shackled, and sedated, or otherwise kidnapped, and transported by private jet or other means to the destination country. The reports also say that the rendering countries have provided interrogators with lists of questions.\n\nOn 4 October 2001, a secret arrangement was made in Brussels by all members of NATO. Lord George Robertson, British defense secretary and later NATO's secretary-general, would later explain NATO members agreed to provide \"blanket overflight clearances for the United States and other allies' aircraft for military flights related to operations against terrorism.\"\n\nOn 23 October 2006, the \"New Yorker\" reported that Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing, handled the logistical planning for the CIA's extraordinary rendition flights. The allegation is based on information from an ex-employee who quoted Bob Overby, managing director of the company as saying \"We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights—you know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way. It certainly pays well.\" The article went on to suggest that this may make Jeppesen a potential defendant in a lawsuit by Khaled El-Masri. Jeppesen was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on 30 May 2007, on behalf of several other individuals who were allegedly subject to extraordinary rendition.\n\nThe suit was dismissed on 8 September 2010 by a federal appeals court on the grounds that \"going forward would reveal state secrets\".\n\nIn 2005, \"The Washington Post\" and Human Rights Watch (HRW) published revelations concerning CIA flights and \"black sites\", covert prisons operated by the CIA and whose existence is denied by the US government. The European Parliament published a report in February 2007 concerning the use of such secret detention centers and extraordinary rendition (\"See below\"). These detention centers violate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the UN Convention Against Torture, treaties that all EU member states are bound to follow.\n\nAccording to ABC News two such facilities, in countries mentioned by Human Rights Watch, have been closed following the recent publicity. CIA officers say the captives were relocated to the North African desert. All but one of these 11 high-value al Qaeda prisoners were subjected to the harshest interrogation techniques in the CIA's secret arsenal, sometimes referred to as \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" authorized for use by about 14 CIA officers.\n\nIn January 2005, Swiss senator Dick Marty, representative at the Council of Europe in charge of the European investigations, concluded that 100 people had been kidnapped by the CIA in Europe—thus qualifying as ghost detainees—and then rendered to a country where they may have been tortured. Marty qualified the sequestration of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka \"Abu Omar\") in Milan in February 2003 as a \"perfect example of extraordinary rendition.\" (See below: The European investigation and its June 2006 report)\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported on 5 December 2005, that the British government is \"guilty of breaking international law if it knowingly allowed secret CIA \"rendition\" flights of terror suspects to land at UK airports, according to a report by American legal scholars.\"\n\nA comment by FAIR on \"The Washington Post\"'s decision to withhold the locations of these secret prisons was that since the revelations \"could open the U.S. government to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad,\" the \"Post\" did its part to minimize these risks. Yet, according to FAIR, \"the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however—it's the whole point of the U.S. First Amendment. ... Without the basic fact of where these prisons are, it's difficult if not impossible for 'legal challenges' or 'political condemnation' to force them to close.\" FAIR argued that the damage done to the global reputation of the United States by the continued existence of black-site prisons was more dangerous than any threat caused by the exposure of their locations.\n\nAccording to \"Raw Story\", the Polish site identified by reporter Larisa Alexandrovna and Polish intelligence officer David Dastych is Stare Kiejkuty.\n\nThe complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified—but never named—when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.\n\nBoth Alexandrovna and Dastych have stated that their sources told them that the same information and documents were provided to \"The Washington Post\" in 2005. In addition, they also identified the methodology of concealing the black sites:\n\nThey go on to explain that \"Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport.\" The airport in question is the Szczytno-Szymany International Airport, according to Alexandrovna and Dastych.\n\nIn response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief, Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were \"... part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush,\" according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur.\"\n\nThe United States has also been accused of operating \"floating prisons\" to house and transport those arrested in its \"War on Terror\", according to human rights lawyers. They have claimed that the US has tried to conceal the numbers and whereabouts of detainees. Although no credible information to support these assertions has ever come to light, the alleged justification for prison ships is primarily to remove the ability for jihadists to target a fixed location to facilitate the escape of high value targets, commanders, operations chiefs etc.\n\nKhalid El-Masri (also Khaled El-Masri and Khaled Masri, , ) (born 29 June 1963) is a German citizen who was mistakenly abducted by the Macedonian police, and handed over to the U.S. CIA. While in CIA custody, he was flown to Afghanistan, where he was allegedly held in a black site, interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomized, and subjected to other inhuman and degrading treatment, which at times escalated to torture, though none of those claims can be verified. After El-Masri held hunger strikes, and was detained for four months in the \"Salt Pit\", the CIA finally admitted his arrest and torture were a mistake and released him. He is believed to be among an estimated 3,000 detainees whom the CIA has abducted from 2001–2005.\n\nOn 17 February 2003, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka \"Abu Omar\") was kidnapped by the CIA in Milan (Italy), and deported to Egypt. His case has been characterized by the Swiss senator Dick Marty as a \"perfect example of extraordinary rendition\". Abu Omar was kidnapped as he walked to his mosque in Milan for noon prayers. He was transported on a Learjet (using the call sign SPAR 92) to Ramstein, Germany. SPAR (Special Air Resources) is the call sign used by US senior military officers and civilian VIPs for airlift transport A second plane took him to Cairo, where he was imprisoned and, he claims, tortured.\n\nIn June 2005, the Italian judge Guido Salvini issued a warrant for the arrest of 13 persons said to be agents or operatives of the CIA in association with Nasr's kidnapping. In December 2005, an Italian court issued a European arrest warrant against 22 CIA agents suspected of this kidnapping (including Robert Seldon Lady, Eliana Castaldo, Lt. Col. Joseph L. Romano, III, etc.). The CIA has not commented on the case, while Berlusconi's government has denied any knowledge of a kidnapping plot. Just after the 2006 Italian general elections, Roberto Castelli (Lega Nord), outgoing Justice Minister, declared to Italian prosecutors that he had not passed the extradition request to the US.\n\nOn 6 December 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported Italian court documents which showed that the CIA tried to mislead Italian anti-terrorism police who were looking for the cleric at the time. Robert S. Lady, the CIA's substation chief in Milan, has been implicated in the abduction. In a written opinion upholding the arrest warrant, judge Enrico Manzi wrote that the evidence taken from Lady's home \"removes any doubt about his participation in the preparatory phase of the abduction.\" Lady, however, alleged that the evidence had been gathered illegally, and has denied involvement in the abduction. Photos of Robert (Bob) Lady and other defendants recently have surfaced on the Web.\n\nMarco Mancini, the SISMI director of anti-terrorism and counterespionage, and Gustavo Pignero, the department's director in 2003, have been arrested on charges of complicity in a kidnapping, with the aggravating circumstances of abuse of power. Italian judges have issued 26 EU arrest warrants for U.S. citizens in connection with this event. A judge also issued arrest warrants for four Americans, three CIA agents and an Air Force officer who commanded the security forces at Aviano Air Base at the time of the abduction.\n\nOn 12 February 2007, Nasr's lawyer said he had been released by Egypt and he was back with his family.\n\nOn 4 November 2009, an Italian judge convicted 22 suspected or known CIA agents, a U.S. Air Force (USAF) colonel, and two Italian secret agents of the kidnapping. These were the first legal convictions in the world against people involved in the CIA's extraordinary renditions program.\n\nA story in the \"Los Angeles Times\" on 8 December 2005 seems to corroborate the claims of \"torture by proxy.\" It mentions the attorneys for Majid Mahmud Abdu Ahmad, a detainee held by the Pentagon at Guantanamo Bay, filed a petition to prevent his being transferred to foreign countries. According to the petition's description of a redacted classified Defense Department memo from 17 March 2004, its contents say \"officials suggested sending Ahmad to an unspecified foreign country that employed torture in order to increase chances of extracting information from him.\"\n\nMr Falkoff, representing Ahmad, continued: \"There is only one meaning that can be gleaned from this short passage,\" the petition says. \"The government believes that Mr. Ahmad has information that it wants but that it cannot extract without torturing him.\" The petition goes on to say that because torture is not allowed at Guantanamo, \"the recommendation is that Mr. Ahmad should be sent to another country where he can be interrogated under torture.\"\nIn a report, regarding the allegations of CIA flights, on 13 December 2005, the rapporteur and Chair of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, Swiss councillor Dick Marty, concluded: \"The elements we have gathered so far tend to reinforce the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees—outside all judicial procedure—in European countries.\"\nIn a press conference in January 2006, he stated \"he was personally convinced the US had undertaken illegal activities in Europe in transporting and detaining prisoners.\"\n\nMuhammad Bashmila, a former secret prisoner, now free in Yemen, gave an interview to the BBC Newsnight programme, where he spoke of being transferred from Afghanistan to a detention center where it was cold, where the food appeared European and where evening prayers were held. Somewhere in Eastern Europe is suspected. This claim cannot be confirmed.\n\nMaher Arar, a Syrian-born dual Syrian and Canadian citizen, was detained at Kennedy International Airport on 26 September 2002, by US Immigration and Naturalization Service officials. He was heading home to Canada after a family holiday in Tunisia. After almost two weeks, enduring hours of interrogation chained, he was sent, shackled and bound, in a private jet to Jordan and then Syria, instead of being deported to Canada. There, he was interrogated and tortured by Syrian intelligence. Maher Arar was eventually released a year later. He told the BBC that he was repeatedly tortured during 10 months' detention in Syria—often whipped on the palms of his hands with metal cables. Syrian intelligence officers forced him to sign a confession linking him to Al Qaeda.\n\nHe was finally released following intervention by the Canadian government. The Canadian government lodged an official complaint with the US government protesting Arar's deportation. On 18 September 2006, a Canadian public enquiry presented its findings, entirely clearing Arar of any terrorist activities. In 2004 Arar filed a lawsuit in a federal court in New York against senior U.S. officials, on charges that whoever sent him to Syria knew he would be tortured by intelligence agents. US Attorney General John Ashcroft, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and FBI Director Robert Mueller were all named in the lawsuit. In 2009, a U.S. federal appeals court ruled that U.S. law did not allow victims of extraordinary rendition to sue U.S. officials for torture suffered overseas.\n\nOn 18 October 2006, Arar received the Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award from the Institute for Policy Studies for his ordeal. On 18 October 2007, Maher Arar received a public apology from the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, who apologized, stated that he would fight any efforts to end the practice.\n\nIn 2007, Arar was awarded $10.5 million in compensation from the Canadian government for pain and suffering in his ordeal and a formal apology from Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\n\"This is a non-exhaustive list of some alleged examples of extraordinary rendition. Most cannot be confirmed.\"\n\nOn 25 November 2005, the lead investigator for the Council of Europe, Swiss lawmaker Dick Marty announced that he had obtained latitude and longitude coordinates for suspected black sites, and he was planning to use satellite imagery over the last several years as part of his investigation. On 28 November 2005, EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini asserted that any EU country which had operated a secret prison would have its voting rights suspended. In a preliminary report, Dick Marty declared that it was \"highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware\" of the CIA kidnapping of a \"hundred\" persons on European territory and their subsequent rendition to countries where they may be tortured.\n\nThe report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Council of Europe directed by Dick Marty, and made public on 7 June 2006, was titled: \"Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of this report, the Council of Europe published its draft Recommendation and Resolution document which\nfound grounds for concern with the conduct of both the US and member states of the EU and expresses concern for the disregard of international law and the Geneva Convention. Following a 23-point resolution the document makes five recommendations.\n\nSeveral months before the publication of the Council of Europe report directed by Dick Marty, Gijs de Vries, the EU's antiterrorism coordinator, asserted in April 2006 that no evidence existed that extraordinary rendition had been taking place in Europe. It was also said that the European Union's probe, and a similar one by the continent's leading human rights group had not found any human rights violations nor other crimes that could be proven to the satisfaction of the courts. This denial from a member of the executive power of the EU institutions has been questioned by the European Parliament report, which was accepted by a vast majority of the Parliament in February 2007 (\"See below:The European Parliament's 14 February 2007 report\").\n\nOn the other hand, Dick Marty explained the difference of approach concerning terrorism between the EU and the US as following:\nWhile the states of the Old World have dealt with these threats primarily by means of existing institutions and legal systems, the United States appears to have made a fundamentally different choice: considering that neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism, it decided to develop new legal concepts. This legal approach is utterly alien to the European tradition and sensibility, and is clearly contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nHowever, despite Marty's claims, the European Parliament investigations uncovered cooperation between European secret services and governments and the extraordinary renditions programs, making such a clear-cut distinction over-simplistic (\"see below\"). Dick Marty himself has not accepted such a dualistic approach, as he showed that for the British government also, the phenomenon of Islamic terrorism was alleged to be so grave that the balance of liberties had to be reconsidered. Marty's report stated that:\n\nThe compilation of so-called \"black lists\" of individuals and companies suspected of maintaining connections with organisations considered terrorist and the application of the associated sanctions clearly breach every principle of the fundamental right to a fair trial: no specific charges, no right to be heard, no right of appeal, no established procedure for removing one's name from the list.\n\nThe second report was released on 8 June 2007\n\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) accused the United States of operating a \"clandestine spiderweb of disappearances, secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers\" and called for EU regulations governing foreign intelligence services operating in Europe, and demanded \"human rights clauses\" in military base agreements with the USA.\n\nIn a resolution and recommendation approved by a large majority, the Assembly also called for:\n\nThe European Parliament launched its own investigation into the reports. In April 2006, MEPs leading the investigations expressed concerns that the CIA had conducted more than 1,000 secret flights over European territory since 2001, some to transfer terror suspects to countries that used torture. Investigators said that the same US agents and planes were involved over and over again. The Parliament adopted a resolution in July 2006 endorsing the Council of Europe's conclusions, midway through its own investigation into the alleged program.\n\n\"In a resolution passed on 14 February 2007 MEPs approved by a large majority (382 voting in favour, 256 against and 74 abstaining) their committee's final report, which criticized the rendition program and concluded that many European countries tolerated illegal CIA activities including secret flights over their territories. The countries named were: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The report ...\n\nAccording to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of the Guantanamo camp. According to Italian Socialist Giovanni Fava, who drafted the document, there was a \"strong possibility\" that the intelligence obtained under the illegal extraordinary rendition program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where \"an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture\".\n\nManfred Nowak, a special reporter on torture, has catalogued in a 15-page U.N. report presented to the 191-member General Assembly that the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Sweden and Kyrgyzstan are violating international human rights conventions by deporting terrorist suspects to countries such as Egypt, Syria, Algeria and Uzbekistan, where they may have been tortured.\n\n\"The United States is holding at least 26 persons as \"ghost detainees\" at undisclosed locations outside of the United States,\" Human Rights Watch said on 1 December 2005, as it released a list naming some of the detainees. The detainees are being held indefinitely and incommunicado, without legal rights or access to counsel.\n\nThe World Policy Council, headed by Ambassador Horace Dawson and Senator Edward Brooke, criticized the Bush Administration in the area of civil and human rights for its policy on extraordinary rendition. The Council concluded in its report that extraordinary rendition\n\nThe French attorney general of Bobigny opened up an instruction in order \"to verify the presence in Le Bourget Airport, on 20 July 2005, of the plane numbered N50BH.\" This instruction was opened following a complaint deposed in December 2005 by the \"Ligue des droits de l'homme\" (LDH) NGO (\"Human Rights League\") and the \"International Federation of Human Rights Leagues\" (FIDH) NGO on charges of \"arbitrary detention\", \"crime of torture\" and \"non-respect of the rights of war prisoners\". It has as objective to determine if the plane was used to transport CIA prisoners to Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and if the French authorities had knowledge of this stop. However, the lawyer defending the LDH declared that he was surprised that the instruction was only opened on 20 January 2006, and that no verifications had been done before.\nOn 2 December 2005, conservative newspaper \"Le Figaro\" had revealed the existence of two CIA planes that had landed in France, suspected of transporting CIA prisoners. But the instruction concerned only N50BH, which was a Gulfstream III, which would have landed at Le Bourget on 20 July 2005, coming from Oslo, Norway. The other suspected aircraft would have landed in Brest on 31 March 2002. It is investigated by the Canadian authorities, as it would have been flying from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, via Keflavík in Iceland before going to Turkey.\n\nBusiness daily \"Handelsblatt\" reported 24 November 2005, that the CIA used an American military base in Germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the German government. The \"Berliner Zeitung\" reported the following day there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a \"high probability\" of being operated by the CIA, at Ramstein, the Rhein-Main Air Base and others. The newspaper cited experts and \"plane-spotters\" who observed the planes as responsible for the tally.\n\nIn January 2007 the German government indicted 13 alleged CIA operatives for the abduction in Macedonia, transport to Afghanistan, and torture of Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen mistakenly believed to be a terrorist. Spanish authorities identified the suspected CIA abduction team from hotel records after a stopover by their Boeing 737 in Palma de Mallorca. Names of the alleged occupants of the rendition aircraft were:\n\nMany of these names proved to be aliases. Investigations by news organizations including the \"Los Angeles Times\", the \"Nation\", and \"Der Spiegel\" identified James Kovalesky (alias James Richard Fairing), Harry Kirk Elarbee (alias Kirk James Bird), and Eric Robert Hume (alias Eric Matthew Fain) as pilots working for Aero Contractors, a CIA flight contractor based in Smithfield, N.C. CBS News identified Lyle Edgard Lumsden III as a US Army captain who \"retired in 1992 from active duty, having served as a physician's assistant\" whose last known address was \"the Washington DC area.\"\n\nNone of the names or aliases in this case match those of the 26 alleged CIA agents prosecuted by Italy (see Imam Rapito affair below), although the Los Angeles Times reported one of the pilots may have been involved in both incidents. \"The New York Times\" reported that the 13 alleged CIA operatives were charged in indictments issued in Spain and in Munich, but because of \"intense political pressure from Washington\" Germany never requested their extradition. In Germany, unlike Italy, defendants cannot be tried \"in absentia\".\n\nIn the \"Imam Rapito affair\" in Italy, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr (aka Abu Omar), an Islamist cleric, was kidnapped in a joint CIA–SISMI operation in Milan on 17 February 2003, transferred to the Aviano Air Base, and then flown to Egypt, where he was held until 11 February 2007, when an Egyptian court ruled his imprisonment was \"unfounded.\" He claims he was abused on the Aviano Base and endured prologued torture in Egypt. Italian prosecutors investigated the abduction, and indicted 26 US citizens including the head of CIA in Italy Jeffrey W. Castelli. SISMI chief General Nicolò Pollari and second-in-command Marco Mancini were forced to resign, and were also indicted. On 4 November 2009, after a trial \"in absentia\", an Italian judge found 23 Americans (names listed here) and the two Italians guilty. The sentences ranged from 5–8 years for the Americans and 3 years each for the Italians. The judge acquitted three American diplomats, citing diplomatic immunity, along with five Italian secret service agents, including the former chief, citing state secrecy. In 2010 an Italian appellate court confirmed most of the verdicts and increased the sentences of the 23 Americans. Among those convicted was Stephen R. Kappes, later the Number Two man at CIA, Robert Seldon Lady, formerly CIA station Chief in Milan, Col. Joseph L. Romano, a U S Air Force officer, and asserted CIA agent Sabrina De Sousa, who unsuccessfully sued the US State Department to grant her diplomatic immunity and shield her from arrest.\n\nThese were the first convictions anywhere in the world arising from the CIA's practice of abducting terror suspects and transferring them to third countries where torture occurred. The US had tried but failed to obstruct the prosecutions by Italy's independent Judiciary. Following the convictions the US used threats and diplomatic pressure to stop the Italian Executive branch from issuing arrest warrants and extradition requests for the Americans.\n\nThe Irish government has come under internal and external pressure to inspect airplanes at Shannon Airport to investigate whether or not they contain extraordinary rendition captives.\nPolice at Shannon Airport said that they had received political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern sought permission from the US for random inspection of US flights, to provide political \"cover\" to him in case rendition flights were revealed to have used Shannon; he believed at least three flights had done so.\nIreland has been censured by the European Parliament for its role in facilitating extraordinary rendition and taking insufficient or no measures to uphold its obligations under the UN CAT.\n\nIn 2002, the Council of Europe's then-Commissioner for Human Rights Alvaro Gil-Robles witnessed \"a smaller version of Guantanamo\", he told France's \"Le Monde\" newspaper.\nGil-Robles told the daily that he had inspected the centre, located within the US military's Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, in 2002, to investigate reports of extrajudicial arrests by NATO-led peacekeepers.\n\nPortugal opened up an investigation concerning CIA flights in February 2007, on the basis of declarations by Socialist MEP Ana Gomes and by Rui Costa Pinto, journalist of \"Visão\" review. The Portuguese general prosecutor, Cândida Almeida, head of the Central Investigation and Penal Action Department (DCIAP), announced the opening of investigations on 5 February 2007. They were to be centered on the issue of \"torture or inhuman and cruel treatment,\" and instigated by allegations of \"illegal activities and serious human rights violations\" made by MEP Ana Gomes to the attorney general, Pinto Monteiro, on 26 January 2007. In February 2008, the UK NGO Reprieve published a report based on flight logs obtained by Ana Gomes, confirming that over 728 prisoners were flown to Guantánamo through Portuguese airspace, and hence through Portuguese jurisdiction, in at least 28 flights.\n\nOne of the most critic voice against the scarce collaboration provided by the Portuguese government to the European Parliament Commission which investigated CIA flights, Ana Gomes declared that, although she had no doubt that permission of these illegal flights were frequent during Durão Barroso (2002–2004) and Santana Lopes (2004–2005)' governments, \"during the [Socialist] government of José Sócrates [2005– ], 24 flights which passed through Portuguese territory\" are registered. Active in the TDIP commission, Ana Gomes complained about the Portuguese state's reluctance to provide information, leading her to tensions with the Foreign minister, Luís Amado, member of the same party. Ana Gomes declared herself satisfied with the opening of the investigations, but underlined that she had always claimed that a parliamentary inquiry would be necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, journalist Rui Costa Pinto was heard by the DCIAP, as he had written an article, refused by \"Visão\", about flights passing by Lajes Field, a Portuguese airbase used by the US Air Forces, in the Azores.\n\nApproximately 150 CIA flights which have flown through Portugal have been identified.\n\nFranco Frattini the European Union Justice Commissioner requested an explanation from the governments of Poland and Romania about the accusations made by Dick Marty. Doris Mircea (Romanian spokeswoman in Brussels) replied to this in November 2007 in a letter stating \"no person was kept illegally as a prisoner within Romanian jails and no illegal transfer of detainees passed through Romanian territory\" and that that was the official finding of a committee of inquiry set up by the government to investigate the accusations.\n\nIn November 2005, Spanish newspaper \"El País\" reported that CIA planes had landed in the Canary Islands and in Palma de Mallorca. Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón, notable for his earlier attempt to prosecute Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, opened up an investigation concerning these landings which, according to Madrid, were made without official knowledge, thus being a breach of national sovereignty. Diplomatic cables exposed in 2010 by WikiLeaks suggest that the United States government including the American ambassador, worked with parts of the Spanish government to subvert the Spanish judicial process to control and ultimately stymie and thwart the investigation.\n\nExtraordinary rendition provoked a diplomatic crisis between the United States and Sweden in 2006 when Swedish authorities put a stop to CIA rendition flights. In December 2001 Swedish police detained Ahmed Agiza and Muhammad al-Zery, two Egyptians who had been seeking asylum in Sweden. The police took them to Bromma airport in Stockholm, and then stood aside as masked alleged CIA operatives cut their clothes from their bodies, inserted drugged suppositories in their anuses, and dressed them in diapers and overalls, handcuffed and chained them and put them on an executive jet with American registration N379P. They were flown to Egypt, where they were imprisoned, beaten, and tortured according to extensive investigate reports by Swedish programme \"Kalla fakta\". A Swedish Parliamentary investigator concluded that the degrading and inhuman treatment of the two prisoners violated Swedish law. In 2006 the United Nations found Sweden had violated an international torture ban in its complicity in the CIA's transfer of al-Zari to Egypt. Sweden imposed strict rules on rendition flights, but Swedish Military Intelligence posing as airport personnel who boarded one of two subsequent extraordinary rendition flights in 2006 during a stopover at Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport found the Swedish restrictions were being ignored. In 2008 the Swedish government awarded al-Zery $500,000 in damages for the abuse he received in Sweden and the subsequent torture in Egypt.\n\nAfter claims by Liberty that British airports had been used by the \"CIA for extraordinary rendition flights, the Association of Chief Police Officers launched an investigation in November 2005. The report was published in June 2007 and found no evidence to support the claim. This was on the same day the Council of Europe released its report with evidence that the UK had colluded in extraordinary rendition, thus directly contradicting ACPO's findings. Liberty has challenged the findings and has stated that its original claims were based on \"credible evidence\".\n\nIn July 2007, the government's Intelligence and Security Committee released their Rendition report, detailing U.S. and U.K. activities and policies.\n\nOn 21 February 2008, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband admitted (despite previous government denials) that two U.S. extraordinary rendition flights had stopped on Diego Garcia in 2002, a U.K. territory. When questioned as to whether the government had deliberately misled the public over rendition, the Foreign Secretary apologised and stated that the government had simply \"made a mistake\". His statement also laid out the current UK Government view on Extraordinary rendition;\n\nA judicial inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson was announced by the government in July 2010, but was never formally launched and was scrapped in January 2012. According to the government, this was due to ongoing criminal investigations. In April 2012 the CIA and FBI won a court ruling in the USA, exempting them from releasing documentation requested by British members of parliament. It later emerged that relevant 2002 flight records from Diego Garcia had been destroyed by water damage.\n\nAn article published in 5 December 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported that the CIA's Inspector General was investigating what it calls erroneous renditions. The term appears to refer to cases in which innocent people were subjected to extraordinary rendition.\n\nKhalid El-Masri is the most well-known person who is believed to have been subjected to the process of \"extraordinary rendition\", as a result of mistaken identity. Laid Saidi, an Algerian detained and tortured along with El-Masri, was apprehended apparently because of a taped telephone conversation in which the word \"tirat\", meaning \"tires\" in Arabic, was mistaken for the word \"tairat\", meaning \"airplanes\".\n\nThe Post's anonymous sources say that the Inspector General is looking into a number of similar cases—possibly as many as thirty innocent men who were captured and transported through what has been called \"erroneous renditions\".\n\nA 27 December 2005 story quotes anonymous CIA insiders claiming there have been 10 or fewer such erroneous renditions.\nIt names the CIA's inspector general, John Helgerson, as the official responsible for the inquiry.\n\nThe AP story quotes Tom Malinowski, Washington office director of Human Rights Watch who said:\n\nI am glad the CIA is investigating the cases that they are aware of, but by definition you are not going to be aware of all such cases, when you have a process designed to avoid judicial safeguards.\n\nTwo days after President Barack Obama was sworn into office, on 22 January 2009, he signed an executive order entitled \"Ensuring Lawful Interrogations\". This order specifically addresses the practice of transferring individuals to other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States. It establishes a committee that will provide recommendations within 180 days of the executive order. It specifically has as its goal a process to ensure that the United States practices do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.\n\nOverall, the executive order calls for more oversight of interrogation by third parties, but does not end extraordinary rendition. The section of the Executive Order relating to extraordinary rendition provides as follows:\n\nOn 2 November 2009 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that victims of extraordinary rendition cannot sue Washington for torture suffered overseas, because Congress has not authorized such lawsuits, in ruling on Canadian citizen Maher Arar's case. On 15 September 2010 PolitiFact.com wrote about the Obama administration's record on renditions:\n\nThe administration has announced new procedural safeguards concerning individuals who are sent to foreign countries. President Obama also promised to shut down the CIA-run \"black sites,\" and there seems to be anecdotal evidence that extreme renditions are not happening, at least not as much as they did during the Bush administration. Still, human rights groups say that these safeguards are inadequate and that the DOJ Task Force recommendations still allow the U.S. to send individuals to foreign countries.\n\nAccording to a report by the Open Society Foundations, 54 countries participated at one point or another with the CIA's extraordinary rendition program:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It can be accidental, and therefore is distinguished from waiver; \"see waiver and forfeiture.\" \n\nHistorically, forfeiture of a convict’s land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act). A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is Giles Corey’s refusal to plead, in the Salem Witch Trials, instead dying under \"peine forte et dure\". By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate. Instead it passed to his sons.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the United States Government began to seize domain names, on the legal theory that they were property used in criminal activities and thus subject to forfeiture.\n\n"}

{"id": "1271927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1271927", "title": "Gender equality", "text": "Gender equality\n\nGender equality, also known as sexual equality, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.\n\nGender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than equal representation, it is strongly tied to women's rights, and often requires policy changes. As of 2017, the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of genders besides women and men, or gender identities outside of the gender binary.\n\nUNICEF says gender equality \"means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike.\"\n\nOn a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including sex trafficking, femicide, wartime sexual violence, and other oppression tactics. UNFPA stated that, \"despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence.\"\n\nAs of 2017, gender equality is the fifth of seventeen sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Gender inequality is measured annually by the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Reports.\n\nChristine de Pizan, an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book \"The Book of the City of Ladies\" that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.\n\nThe Shakers, an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict celibacy, were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a Quaker community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers' central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought Lucy Wright into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men's spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham's death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.\n\nShakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women's rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were \"the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand\". Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women's rights advocates on speakers' platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:\nThe Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.\n\nIn wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the suffrage movement in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to women's property rights, particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, Married Women's Property Act 1882.)\n\nSince World War II, the women's liberation movement and feminism have created a general movement towards recognition of women's rights. The United Nations and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:\n\nSuch legislation and affirmative action policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least \"somewhat important,\" and a global median of 65% believe it is \"very important\" that women have the same rights as men. Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.\n\nSimilarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered women's work, such as nursing, cleaning and child care. In domestic situations, the role of Parenting or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a career after childbirth. For further information, see Shared earning/shared parenting marriage.\n\nAnother manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband's surname on marriage.\n\nA highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in religiously orientated societies. Some Christians or Muslims believe in Complementarianism, a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.\n\nIn addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a cultural preference for a male child has resulted in a shortfall of women in the population. The feminist movement in Japan has made many strides which resulted in Rethe Gender Equality Bureau, but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.\n\nThe notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas. Indeed, there is a need for caution when categorizing countries by the level of gender equality that they have achieved. According to Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon \"gender policy is not one issue but many\" and:\nNot all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted. For example, topfreedom, the right to be bare breasted in public, frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue. Breastfeeding in public is now more commonly tolerated, especially in semi-private places such as restaurants.\n\nIt is the vision that men and women should be treated equally in social, economic and all other aspects of society, and to not be discriminated against on the basis of their gender. Gender equality is one of the objectives of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. World bodies have defined gender equality in terms of human rights, especially women's rights, and economic development.. The United Nation's Millennium Development Goals Report states that their goal is to \"achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women\".Despite economic struggles in developing countries, the United Nations is still trying to promote gender equality, as well as help create a sustainable living environment is all its nations.Their goals also include giving women who work certain full-time jobs equal pay to the men with the same job.\n\nThere has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of \"progress\" in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim at improving the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men, and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male. One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the European Union, is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression.\n\nA further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of imperialism and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of \"othering\" of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders - the \"violent others\" - and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures. These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world. They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in family law in the 1980s. Another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women, with some forms of violence such as honor killings (most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of Asia and North Africa) being frequently the object of public debate, while other forms of violence, such as the lenient punishment for crimes of passion across Latin America, do not receive the same attention in the West. It is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of colonialism on those legal systems. There has been controversy surrounding the concepts of Westernization and Europeanisation, due to their reminder of past colonialism, and also due to the fact that some Western countries, such as Switzerland, have been themselves been very slow to give women legal rights.\n\nThere has been criticism that international law, international courts, and universal gender neutral concepts of human rights are at best silent on many of the issues important to women and at worst male centered; considering the male person to be the default. Excessive gender neutrality can worsen the situation of women, because the law \"assumes\" women are in the same position as men, ignoring the biological fact that in the process of reproduction and pregnancy there is no 'equality', and that apart from physical differences there are socially constructed limitations which assign a socially and culturally inferior position to women - a situation which requires a specific approach to women's rights, not merely a gender neutral one. In a 1975 interview, Simone de Beauvoir talked about the negative reactions towards women's rights from the left that was supposed to be progressive and support social change, and also expressed skepticism about mainstream international organizations.\n\nIn 2010, the European Union opened the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in Vilnius, Lithuania to promote gender equality and to fight sex discrimination. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016–2020.\n\nGender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts. Personal, Social and Health Education, religious studies and Language acquisition curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.\n\nA large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the United Nations Population Fund states that, \"Women's empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment.\"\n\nUNFPA says that \"research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes.\"\n\nSocial constructs of gender (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable masculinity and femininity) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm women's health. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through risk taking, and men dying at much higher rate from lung cancer due to smoking, in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting men's health. The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of HIV/AIDS.\n\nViolence against women is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly \"because\" they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs. Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage (domestic violence) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as dowry, bride price, forced marriage and child marriage).\n\nAccording to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on Intimate partner violence victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.\n\nIn countries where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare, the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners. By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence, murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity. In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.\n\nIn some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.\n\nIn most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The Istanbul Convention acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.\n\nIn some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male 'owners' of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women's family. Such practices include payback rape, a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the Pacific Islands, which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.\n\nRichard A. Posner writes that \"Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife's chastity or his daughter's virginity\". Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the honor of the family, rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members. Catharine MacKinnon argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences. Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common. One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object.\n\nThe importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and the UN International Conference on Population and Development Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nMaternal mortality is a major problem in many parts of the world. UNFPA states that countries have an obligation to protect women's right to health, but many countries do not do that. Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of human rights.\n\nThe right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as forced sterilization, forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. forced marriage, child marriage), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as sex outside marriage), lack of criminalization of marital rape, violence in regard to the choice of partner (honor killings as punishment for 'inappropriate' relations). The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman's right to control her sexuality is not recognized.\n\nAdolescent girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.\n\nFamily planning is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. Abortion laws vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being conscientious objectors. Family planning is particularly important from a women's rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women's health. UNFA writes that \"Family planning is central to gender equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty\".\n\nFamily planning is often opposed by governments who have strong natalist policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from communist Romania and communist Albania. State mandated forced marriage was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution. By contrast, the one child policy of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and forced abortions. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in Peru, President Alberto Fujimori (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the Quechuas and the Aymaras).\n\nHuman rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal impunity of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities. This is especially the case with murders of women in Latin America. In particular, there is impunity in regard to domestic violence.\n\nWomen are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: \"Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice\". Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.\n\n\"Harmful traditional practices\" refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can be affected. They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.\nThese practices include, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:\n\nSon preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.\n\nAbuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.\n\nThe caste system in India which leads to untouchability (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by Dalit women. In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.\n\nTraditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to \"confess\" to the infidelity.\n\nTribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the Satere-Mawe tribe use bullet ants as an initiation rite. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants' stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered \"warriors\".\n\nOther harmful traditional practices include marriage by abduction, ritualized sexual slavery (Devadasi, Trokosi), breast ironing and widow inheritance.\n\nUNFPA and UNICEF regard the practice of female genital mutilation as \"a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs.\" \n\nAn estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia. It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.\n\nEarly marriage, child marriage or forced marriage is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23. Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl's education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.\n\nThe 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that \"Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]\". Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, \"one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18.\" UNFPA states that, \"over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue.\"\n\nBride price (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals. The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. UN Women recommended its abolition, and stated that: \"Legislation should [...] State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women’s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge.\"\n\nThe custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman's family; and the woman's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands' homes.\n\nPromoting gender equality is seen as an encouragement to greater economic prosperity. Female economic activity is a common measure of gender equality in an economy.\n\nGender discrimination often results in women obtaining low-wage jobs and being disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination and exploitation. A growing body of research documents what works to economically empower women, from providing access to formal financial services to training on agricultural and business management practices, though more research is needed across a variety of contexts to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions.\n\nGender biases also exist in product and service provision. The term \"Women's Tax\", also known as \"Pink Tax\", refers to gendered pricing in which products or services marketed to women are more expensive than similar products marketed to men. Gender-based price discrimination involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices, as determined by the target market. Studies have found that women pay about $1,400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing. Although the \"pink tax\" of different goods and services is not uniform, overall women pay more for commodities that result in visual evidence of feminine body image.\n\nSince the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role. Policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations.\nShared earning/shared parenting marriage, that is, a relationship where the partners collaborate at sharing their responsibilities inside and outside of the home, is often encouraged in Western countries.\n\nWestern countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland. In the computer technology world of Silicon Valley in the United States, \"New York Times\" reporter Nellie Bowles has covered harassment and bias against women as well as a backlash against female equality.\n\nA key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of maternity rights and reproductive rights of women. Different countries have different rules regarding maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave. Another important issue is ensuring that employed women are not \"de jure\" or \"de facto\" prevented from having a child. In some countries, employers ask women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant or face legal punishment. Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the International Labour Organization classifies forced abortion coerced by the employer as labour exploitation. Other abuses include routine virginity tests of unmarried employed women.\n\nSee also: Effect of parental leave policies on gender equality\n\nThe degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. Seclusion of women within the home was a common practice among the upper classes of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.\n\nWomen's freedom of movement continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to marriage laws. In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.\n\nThe Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:\nIn addition to laws, women's freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms. Restrictions on freedom of movement also exist due to traditional practices such as baad, swara, or vani.\n\nIn many parts of the world, girls' access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms. According to OHCHR, there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with \"a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education\". The United Nations Population Fund says:\n\nWomen are underrepresented in most countries' National Parliaments. The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation called for female participation in politics, and expressed concern about the fact that \"women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere\". Only 22 percent of parliamentarians globally are women and therefore, men continue to occupy most positions of political and legal authority. As of November 2014, women accounted for 28% of members of the single or lower houses of parliaments in the European Union member states.\n\nIn some Western countries women have only recently obtained the right to vote.\n\nIn 2015, 61.3% of Rwanda's Lower House of Parliament were women, the highest proportion anywhere in the world, but worldwide that was one of only two such bodies where women were in the majority, the other being Bolivia's Lower House of Parliament. (See also Gender equality in Rwanda).\n\nEqual rights for women in marriage, divorce, and property/land ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has called for the end of discriminatory family laws. In 2013, UN Women stated that \"While at least 115 countries recognize equal land rights for women and men, effective implementation remains a major challenge\".\n\nThe legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards. Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through marriage laws giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through marriage bars. In 1978, the Council of Europe passed the \"Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law\". Switzerland was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women's rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). In the Netherlands, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved: prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family.\n\nIn the United States, a wife's legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of \"Kirchberg v. Feenstra\", , a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.\n\nThere have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life. For example, in Australia, until 1983 a husband had to authorize an application for an Australian passport for a married woman. Other practices have included, and in many countries continue to include, a requirement for a husband's consent for an application for bank loans and credit cards by a married woman, as well as restrictions on the wife's reproductive rights, such as a requirement that the husband consents to the wife's acquiring contraception or having an abortion. In some places, although the law itself no longer requires the consent of the husband for various actions taken by the wife, the practice continues \"de facto\", with the authorization of the husband being asked in practice.\n\nAlthough dowry is today mainly associated with South Asia, the practice has been common until the mid-20th century in parts of Southeast Europe.\n\nLaws regulating marriage and divorce continue to discriminate against women in many countries. In Iraq husbands have a legal right to \"punish\" their wives, with paragraph 41 of the criminal code stating that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. In the 1990s and the 21st century there has been progress in many countries in Africa: for instance in Namibia the marital power of the husband was abolished in 1996 by the \"Married Persons Equality Act\"; in Botswana it was abolished in 2004 by the \"Abolition of Marital Power Act\"; and in Lesotho it was abolished in 2006 by the \"Married Persons Equality Act\". Violence against a wife continues to be seen as legally acceptable in some countries; for instance in 2010, the United Arab Emirates Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The criminalization of adultery has been criticized as being a prohibition, which, in law or in practice, is used primarily against women; and incites violence against women (crimes of passion, honor killings).\n\nTwo recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the Democratic Regions Party (DBP) and the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), from 2006 or before.\nThe mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party's male and female co-leaders.\n\nA movement in northern Syria, also Kurdish, has been led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD). In northern Syria all villages, towns and cities governed by the PYD were co-governed by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed where each sex had to have 40% representation, and minorities also had to be represented.\n\nGender stereotypes arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being \"supportive\" or \"nurturing\". Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs. Their male counterparts are seen as being \"assertive\" or \"ambitious\" as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family. Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace.\n\nA gender role is a set of societal norms dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity, although there are exceptions and variations.\n\nThe way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The exploitation of women in mass media refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the mass media, when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population's perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects. The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and\nsubservient to men. Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.\n\nAccording to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to: \"Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women\"; \"Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence\"; \"Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave\"; \"Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on\"; \"The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls' development.\" Studies have found that nearly half of females ages 6–8 have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore & Franko, 2002)\".\n\nA few numbers on women's representation in the media:\n\n\nWhile in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact is that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women's rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, \"Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems\".\n\nThe 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] \"States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms\". Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect, if women do not know how to use it: for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60% did not know what a restraining order was; or if they don't know what acts are illegal: a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was an illegal (it was outlawed in 1997) and therefore the crime was rarely reported. Ensuring women have a minim understanding of health issues is also important: lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts women's health.\n\nGender mainstreaming is described as the public policy of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned policy action, including legislation and programmes, in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality. The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya. The idea has been developed in the United Nations development community. Gender mainstreaming \"involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities\".\n\nAccording to the Council of Europe definition: \"Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making.\"\n\nAn integrated gender mainstreaming approach is \"the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights.\" For example, \"in Azerbaijan, UNFPA conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23245497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23245497", "title": "Gumshoe System", "text": "Gumshoe System\n\nThe Gumshoe System (stylised as \"The GUMSHOE System\") is a role-playing game system created in 2007 by Robin Laws, designed for running investigative scenarios. The premise is that investigative games are not about finding clues, they are about interpreting the clues that are found. The \"Gumshoe System\" is used in various games published by Pelgrane Press. As a result of the Hillfolk kickstarter, the SRD for the \"GUMSHOE System\" has been made available for use under two open licenses: the Open Game License (OGL) and Creative Commons (CC).\n\nOf the games in the line, \"Trail of Cthulhu\" won the 2010 Lucca Games award for best role-playing game and \"Ashen Stars\" was a 2011 nominee for the Origins Award for best RPG.\n\nThe \"Gumshoe System\" is designed around the idea that investigative scenarios are difficult to run with most role-playing systems. The problem is identified as important clues being missed due to failed dice-rolls, resulting in play grinding to a halt.\n\nThe \"Gumshoe System\" is designed to solve this by making the game not about finding clues, but about interpreting them. Attention is given to designing investigative scenarios, while at the same time the focus is put on encouraging the players to take control of the investigation (and, thereby, the story being told).\n\nThe \"Gumshoe System\" is player-centric, putting die rolling in the hands of the players whenever possible. Non-player character abilities either modify the roll made by the player, or succeeds or fails depending on what the game master finds dramatically appropriate. Direct conflict between characters, such as combat, is an exception.\n\nPlayer characters in the \"Gumshoe System\" are created by using build points to buy rating points in character abilities. Points are spent on a one-for-one basis.\n\nEach player character receives a number of investigative build points depending on the number of players and the setting. In \"The Esoterrorists\" setting, two players receive 32 investigative build points each, while five or more players receive 20 build points each. Any number of investigative build points can be spent on an investigative ability, though more than 3 or 4 points is rarely useful.\n\nEach player character receives a number of general build points depending on the setting, but regardless of number of players. In \"The Esoterrorists\" setting players receive 60 general build points each. Any number of general build points can be spent on a general ability, as long as the second highest rated ability is at least half that of the highest rated. After a scenario is completed, player characters receive new build points which can be used as either investigative or general build points. The amount acquired depends on the length of the scenario. There are no levels through which player characters progress.\n\nAll mechanics in the \"Gumshoe System\" revolve around character abilities. Attributes, common to most role-playing games, are not used in \"Gumshoe\". Rating points goes into a pool of points that can be used in spends related to that ability. Spent or lost points from ability pools are refreshed at various points of play.\n\nThe purpose of investigative abilities is to find clues that advance the story. These clues are called core clues. Investigative abilities always work; there are no dice rolls involved. If a scene contains a core clue and a player character uses an investigative ability that relates to the clue, the character will find the clue.\n\nA spend for an investigative ability costs 1 or 2 points. A spend gives additional clues. These clues are not necessary to solve the scenario, though they should give additional information or other benefits. Spent pool points from investigative abilities are refreshed between scenarios.\n\nExample of investigative abilities: Architecture, Cop Talk, Forensic Accounting.\n\nGeneral abilities are used when an unknown outcome is dramatically appropriate. For these situations, the Gumshoe System utilizes a single six-sided die, which is rolled against a difficulty (or target number). This is called a test. The standard difficulty is 4, though it can be modified to anything from 2 to 8 to represent special circumstances.\n\nAs long as the die roll is equal to or higher than the difficulty, the player character has succeeded in its action.\n\nA spend for a general ability can be as high as that ability's pool. Each point spent adds 1 to the die roll. Spent pool points from general abilities are refreshed between scenarios, though special circumstances can refresh some points during play.\n\nExample of general abilities: Athletics, Health, Shooting.\n\nThough Health and Stability are general abilities, they function differently. While other abilities are exhausted once they reach 0, Health and Stability can reach negative numbers. This represents serious injury or mental illness. If either ability reaches −12, the player character has died or gone permanently insane.\n\nUse of appropriate abilities can refresh some spent or lost points in Health and Stability during play. Apart from that, Stability refreshes between scenarios, while the player character is required to rest to refresh Health.\n\nPelgrane Press has produced a number of games that use the \"Gumshoe System\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14907", "title": "Inverse function", "text": "Inverse function\n\nIn mathematics, an inverse function (or anti-function) is a function that \"reverses\" another function: if the function applied to an input gives a result of , then applying its inverse function to gives the result , and vice versa, i.e., if and only if .\n\nAs an example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by . Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number , multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get back from some output value, say , we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,\nWith we have that and .\n\nNot all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function to have an inverse, it must have the property that for every in there must be one, and only one in so that . This property ensures that a function will exist having the necessary relationship with .\n\nLet be a function whose domain is the set , and whose image (range) is the set . Then is \"invertible\" if there exists a function with domain and image , with the property:\n\nIf is invertible, the function is unique, which means that there is exactly one function satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function is then called \"the\" inverse of , and is usually denoted as .\n\nStated otherwise, a function, considered as a binary relation, has an inverse if and only if the converse relation is a function on the range , in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.\n\nNot all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element must correspond to no more than one ; a function with this property is called one-to-one or an injection. If is to be a function on , then each element must correspond to some . Functions with this property are called surjections. This property is satisfied by definition if is the image (range) of , but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called bijections. The inverse of an injection that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a partial function on , which means that for some , is undefined. If a function is invertible, then both it and its inverse function are bijections.\n\nThere is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the \"set-theoretic\" or \"graph\" definition using ordered pairs in which a codomain is never referred to. Under this convention all functions are surjections, and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection. The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.\n\nThe function given by is not injective since each possible result \"y\" (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in – one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-injective or, in some applications, information-losing.\n\nIf the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be with the same \"rule\" as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible. The inverse function here is called the \"(positive) square root function\".\nIf is an invertible function with domain and range , then\n\nUsing the composition of functions we can rewrite this statement as follows:\n\nwhere is the identity function on the set ; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In category theory, this statement is used as the definition of an inverse morphism.\n\nConsidering function composition helps to understand the notation . Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called iteration. If is applied times, starting with the value , then this is written as ; so , etc. Since , composing and yields , \"undoing\" the effect of one application of .\n\nWhile the notation might be misunderstood, certainly denotes the multiplicative inverse of and has nothing to do with the inverse function of .\n\nIn keeping with the general notation, some English authors use expressions like to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to (actually a partial inverse; see below) Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of , which can be denoted as . To avoid any confusion, an inverse trigonometric function is often indicated by the prefix \"arc\" (for Latin \"arcus\"). For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the arcsine function, written as . Similarly, the inverse of a hyperbolic function is indicated by the prefix \"ar\" (for Latin \"area\"). For instance, the inverse of the hyperbolic sine function is typically written as . Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix \"inv\" if the ambiguity of the notation should be avoided.\n\nSince a function is a special type of binary relation, many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of converse relations.\n\nIf an inverse function exists for a given function , then it is unique. This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by .\n\nThere is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if is an invertible function with domain and range , then its inverse has domain and range , and the inverse of is the original function . In symbols, for functions and ,\n\nThis statement is a consequence of the implication that for to be invertible it must be bijective. The involutory nature of the inverse can be concisely expressed by \nThe inverse of a composition of functions is given by \nNotice that the order of and have been reversed; to undo followed by , we must first undo and then undo .\n\nFor example, let and let . Then the composition is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five,\nTo reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three,\nThis is the composition\n\nIf is a set, then the identity function on is its own inverse:\n\nMore generally, a function is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition is equal to . Such a function is called an involution.\n\nSingle-variable calculus is primarily concerned with functions that map real numbers to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through formulas, such as:\nA surjective function from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of has, for each possible value only one corresponding value, and thus passes the horizontal line test.\n\nThe following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:\n\nOne approach to finding a formula for , if it exists, is to solve the equation for . For example, if is the function\n\nthen we must solve the equation for :\n\nThus the inverse function is given by the formula\n\nSometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms. For example, if is the function\n\nthen is a bijection, and therefore possesses an inverse function . The formula for this inverse has an infinite number of terms:\n\nIf is invertible, then the graph of the function\n\nis the same as the graph of the equation\n\nThis is identical to the equation that defines the graph of , except that the roles of and have been reversed. Thus the graph of can be obtained from the graph of by switching the positions of the and axes. This is equivalent to reflecting the graph across the line\n\nA continuous function is invertible on its range (image) if and only if it is either strictly increasing or decreasing (with no local maxima or minima). For example, the function\n\nis invertible, since the derivative\n\nIf the function is differentiable on an interval and for each , then the inverse will be differentiable on . If , the derivative of the inverse is given by the inverse function theorem,\nUsing Leibniz's notation the formula above can be written as\nThis result follows from the chain rule (see the article on inverse functions and differentiation).\n\nThe inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables. Specifically, a differentiable multivariable function is invertible in a neighborhood of a point as long as the Jacobian matrix of at is invertible. In this case, the Jacobian of at is the matrix inverse of the Jacobian of at .\n\n\n\n\nEven if a function is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a partial inverse of by restricting the domain. For example, the function\n\nis not one-to-one, since . However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain , in which case\n\n(If we instead restrict to the domain , then the inverse is the negative of the square root of .) Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a multivalued function:\n\nSometimes this multivalued inverse is called the full inverse of , and the portions (such as and −) are called \"branches\". The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the \"principal branch\", and its value at is called the \"principal value\" of .\n\nFor a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of local extrema. For example, the inverse of a cubic function with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).\nThese considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of trigonometric functions. For example, the sine function is not one-to-one, since\n\nfor every real (and more generally for every integer ). However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval\n, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the arcsine. This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between − and . The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:\n\nIf , a left inverse for (or \"retraction\" of ) is a function such that\n\nThat is, the function satisfies the rule\n\nThus, must equal the inverse of on the image of , but may take any values for elements of not in the image. A function with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in constructive mathematics. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion of the two-element set in the reals violates indecomposability by giving a retraction of the real line to the set .\n\nA right inverse for (or \"section\" of ) is a function such that\n\nThat is, the function satisfies the rule\n\nThus, may be any of the elements of that map to under .

The concept and phrase \"negative entropy\" was introduced by Erwin Schrödinger in his 1944 popular-science book \"What is Life?\" Later, Léon Brillouin shortened the phrase to \"negentropy\", to express it in a more \"positive\" way: a living system imports negentropy and stores it. In 1974, Albert Szent-Györgyi proposed replacing the term \"negentropy\" with \"syntropy\". That term may have originated in the 1940s with the Italian mathematician Luigi Fantappiè, who tried to construct a unified theory of biology and physics. Buckminster Fuller tried to popularize this usage, but \"negentropy\" remains common.\n\nIn a note to \"What is Life?\" Schrödinger explained his use of this phrase.\nIn 2009, Mahulikar & Herwig redefined negentropy of a dynamically ordered sub-system as the specific entropy deficit of the ordered sub-system relative to its surrounding chaos. Thus, negentropy has SI units of (J kg K) when defined based on specific entropy per unit mass, and (K) when defined based on specific entropy per unit energy. This definition enabled: \"i\") scale-invariant thermodynamic representation of dynamic order existence, \"ii\") formulation of physical principles exclusively for dynamic order existence and evolution, and \"iii\") mathematical interpretation of Schrödinger's negentropy debt.\n\nIn information theory and statistics, negentropy is used as a measure of distance to normality. Out of all distributions with a given mean and variance, the normal or Gaussian distribution is the one with the highest entropy. Negentropy measures the difference in entropy between a given distribution and the Gaussian distribution with the same mean and variance. Thus, negentropy is always nonnegative, is invariant by any linear invertible change of coordinates, and vanishes if and only if the signal is Gaussian.\n\nNegentropy is defined as\n\nwhere formula_2 is the differential entropy of the Gaussian density with the same mean and variance as formula_3 and formula_4 is the differential entropy of formula_3:\n\nNegentropy is used in statistics and signal processing. It is related to network entropy, which is used in independent component analysis.\n\nThere is a physical quantity closely linked to free energy (free enthalpy), with a unit of entropy and isomorphic to negentropy known in statistics and information theory. In 1873, Willard Gibbs created a diagram illustrating the concept of free energy corresponding to free enthalpy. On the diagram one can see the quantity called capacity for entropy. This quantity is the amount of entropy that may be increased without changing an internal energy or increasing its volume. In other words, it is a difference between maximum possible, under assumed conditions, entropy and its actual entropy. It corresponds exactly to the definition of negentropy adopted in statistics and information theory. A similar physical quantity was introduced in 1869 by Massieu for the isothermal process (both quantities differs just with a figure sign) and then Planck for the isothermal-isobaric process. More recently, the Massieu–Planck thermodynamic potential, known also as \"free entropy\", has been shown to play a great role in the so-called entropic formulation of statistical mechanics, applied among the others in molecular biology and thermodynamic non-equilibrium processes.\n\nIn 1953, Léon Brillouin derived a general equation stating that the changing of an information bit value requires at least kT ln(2) energy. This is the same energy as the work Leó Szilárd's engine produces in the idealistic case. In his book, he further explored this problem concluding that any cause of this bit value change (measurement, decision about a yes/no question, erasure, display, etc.) will require the same amount of energy.\n\n"}

The organization focuses on the academic success of foster children. NYFC's goal is to help all youth in the foster care system succeed academically and with equal opportunity in the workforce. With their partner Administration for Children's Services (ACS), NYFC is able to provide school supplies, access to academic counselling, job opportunities, access to schools, as well as financial support to keep them in school.\n\nSince its founding New Yorkers For Children has raised and donated over $55 million to its programs, scholarships, and its partnership with ACS.\n\nNicholas Scoppetta founded NYFC after he was recruited by New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to run the newly formed children service agency. Scopetta was credited for facilitating the re-formulation of the system which resulted in improved training, management, pay, and accountability. He was also successful in getting more children adopted out of the system, reducing case loads, as well as hiring more employees. With these achievements Scoppetta formed NYFC and was the President of Board of Directors until his retirement in 2013 where he was replaced by Eric Brettschneider. Brettschneider started working in the child welfare and social services in 1967 and has worked in various specializations of that sector ever since. With his experience he has pledged to \"continue the tradition Nick (Scoppetta) established - empowering the child welfare community\".\n\nThe program aims at supplying people from the foster system with supplies necessary for their successful completion of a bachelor's degree. The package, valued at $1000, comes with a metro pass, laptop, and Amazon gift card intended to help the student purchase more supplies and eliminate some of their disadvantages. NYFC has provided 8,000 packages to 2,500 students in foster care.\n\nThis program provides financial, emotional, and academic support to students to ensure their successful completion of an academic career. Working together with the \"private sector, foster care agencies, CUNY (City University of New York, the system of universities in New York) and Private Colleges in New York City\" the NYFC has been able to provide a support system for the students in or leaving foster care.\n\nThis Emergency Fund goes to people leaving the foster care system and financially supports them to be able to complete their educations without having to worry about their financial situations too much. Since these students leave the care of the foster system without the traditional support from families they often live pay cheque to pay cheque. Once a financial emergency hits, the students are forced to decide between their education and finding a job to raise funds for their basic needs. The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund provides students with financial support to ensure they continue their education.\nThe Spirit Award is given to a student from the foster care system that is succeeding in college as well as demonstrating leadership, commitment to the community, determination, and has shown the ability to overcome barriers. In 2016 the award was given to two students in full ($10,000) and second place prizes were awarded to two students of the value of $2,500.\n\nThe Wrap to Rap is a holiday event where board members, friends of the NYFC, and teens of the community join together to wrap Christmas presents. The gifts go to children in foster care. The event serves as a community event to support the organizations efforts while allowing teens the opportunity to learn of the struggles of others and simultaneously getting them involved in volunteering for the community.\nThe Youth Advisory Board is in charge of promoting social change in regards to changing how the social system supports foster children once they are too old for foster care. Their social policy efforts fight mainly for affordable housing, post secondary opportunities, and funding for college.\n\nNew Yorkers For Children makes most of its revenues from foundation and business organizations contributions. In 2016 alone the organization made $3.2 million in foundation and business organizations contributions. NYFC's special events bring in the second largest amount of revenue. From 2012 to 2016 NYFC's events brought in on average $2.1 million. Each event honours a few of the children receiving aid from the foundation and supplies them with proper clothing attire for the night. The events are also each sponsored by a big brand or corporation, for example Chloé and by Circa in 2010. In 2015 the Spring Dinner Dance was presented by Saks Fifth Avenue, the Fool's Fete of 2012 was sponsored by CD Greene. Each of these big named sponsors bring in different crowds of people to the events and increases and diversifies the organizations base of donors.\nHeld every year in the fall, NYFC's New Yorker For Children Annual Fall Gala at Cipriani 42nd Street consistently raises over $1.2 million. With tickets starting at $1,200 and tables being sold for up to $50,000, the evening is always a success for the organization. The event is attended by actors, designers, athletes, journalists, artists, wealthy business entrepreneurs, and singers all willing to spend big money for charity. The Gala is meant to raise money as well as acknowledge people for their own charitable efforts. It also receives media coverage from well known news outlets like Vogue, InStyle, and New Getty.\nIn 2015 the event held at the Mandarin Oriental raised $750,000 with tickets selling out before they are made open to the public. In 2015 the event was publicized not only for its philanthropic work but also because it honoured the fashion legend Oscar de la Renta giving the event an edge in the media. More attention is brought to the event due to the attendance of well known people like actress Emma Roberts as well as royalty of a Saudi Prince in 2013. Although the event does not raise as much money as the Annual Fall Gala, the publicity that the organization gets largely affects its donations.\n\nNew Yorkers For Children receives a lot of supports from public figures, actors, artists, singers, athletes, etc. In 2009 Anderson Cooper, anchor for CNN, hosted the annual fall gala. This night included awarding Mary J. Blige the Nicholas Scoppetta Child Welfare Award for her own organization FFAWN which empowers and supports women to go to college.\n\nPast honourees include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Geoffrey Canada, Russell Simmons, and All-Pro Linebacker for the New York Giants, Keith Bulluck. This list of honourees shows the diverse background of people that participate in charitable functions.\n\nFurthermore, the annual fall gala also included Ne-Yo performing his hit songs and Oscar-nominated director Tony Gilroy premiered his short film about eight youth in foster care. 19 youth who receive aid from NYFC were guests of honour. Macy's provided them with clothing while MAC Cosmetics and French hairstylist Frederic Fekkai provided hair and makeup.\n\nIn 2013 Hugh Jackman co-chaired the event with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness. Jackman expressed his appreciation and support for New Yorkers For Children: \"I love what New Yorkers for Children does. It's at a grass-roots level, it doesn't throw money here and there, it really looks after kids with what they need emotionally as well as financially.\"\n\nNew Yorkers For Children is partnered with the government organization Administration for Children Services (ACS). NYFC supports the organization's projects financially. In 2016 the NYFC donated $100,000 in grants to fund the Community Connections Project, The Door Project, and ACS Special Programs and Events. The Community Connections Project is a detention release initiative that works to support low risk individuals that are being removed from detention and rehabilitated in their homes with their families. The Door project works to offer homeless people and \"system-involved\" young people better access to post-secondary opportunities. This initiative is community based and supported by education services, and external partnerships. ACS Special Programs and Events promotes child wellbeing projects specifically Safe Sleep Symposium and Child Abuse Awareness month.\n"}

It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.\n\nReligious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.\n\nMostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: \"re-formare\", reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for ethical prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.\n\nThe eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a \"final\" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by Karl Barth in 1947: \"Ecclesia semper reformanda est\", i.e. \"The church is always to be reformed.\"\n\nReligious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to restore paganism as state religion.\n\nThe opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is modernism. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41381753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41381753", "title": "Relapse prevention", "text": "Relapse prevention\n\nRelapse prevention (RP) is a cognitive-behavioral approach to relapse with the goal of identifying and preventing high-risk situations such as substance abuse, obsessive-compulsive behavior, sexual offending, obesity, and depression. It is an important component in the treatment process for alcoholism, or alcohol dependence.\n\nRelapse is seen as both an outcome and a transgression in the process of behavior change. An initial setback or lapse may translate into either a return to the previous problematic behavior, known as relapse, or the individual turning again towards positive change, called prolapse. A relapse often occurs in the following stages: emotional relapse, mental relapse, and finally, physical relapse. Each stage is characterized by feelings, thoughts, and actions that ultimately lead to the individual returning to their old behavior. \n\nRelapse is thought to be multi-determined, especially by self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, craving, motivation, coping, emotional states, and interpersonal factors. In particular, high self-efficacy, negative outcome expectancies, potent availability of coping skills following treatment, positive affect, and functional social support are expected to predict positive outcome. Craving has not historically been shown to serve as a strong predictor of relapse.\n\nCarroll \"et al\". conducted a review of 24 other trials and concluded that RP was more effective than no treatment and was equally effective as other active treatments such as supportive psychotherapy and interpersonal therapy in improving substance use outcomes. Irvin and colleagues also conducted a meta-analysis of RP techniques in the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and polysubstance use, and upon reviewing 26 studies, concluded that RP was successful in reducing substance use and improving psychosocial adjustment. RP seemed to be most effective for individuals with alcohol problems, suggesting that certain characteristics of alcohol use are amenable to the RP. Miller et al. (1996) found the GORSKI/CENAPS relapse warning signs to be a good predictor of the occurrence of relapse on the AWARE scale (r = .42, p < .001).\n\nSome theorists, including Katie Witkiewitz and G. Alan Marlatt, borrowing ideas from systems theory, conceptualize relapse as a multidimensional, complex system. Such a nonlinear dynamical system is believed to be able to best predict the data witnessed, which commonly includes cases where small changes introduced into the equation seem to have large effects. The model also introduces concepts of self-organization, feedback loops, timing/context effects, and interplay between tonic and phasic processes.\n\nRami Jumnoodoo and Dr. Patrick Coyne, in London UK, have been working with National Health Service users and carers over the past ten years to transfer RP theory into the field of adult mental health. The uniqueness of the model is the sustainment of change by developing service users and carers as 'experts' - following RP as an educational process and graduating as Relapse Prevention Practitioners. The work has won many national awards, been presented at many conferences, and has resulted in a number of publications.\n\nTerence Gorski MA has developed the CENAPS (Center for Applied Science) model for relapse prevention including Relapse Prevention Counseling (Gorski, Counseling For Relapse Prevention, 1983) and a system for certification of Relapse Prevention Specialists (CRPS).\n\n"}

The Second Amendment declares:\n\nIn the United States, which has an English common law tradition, the concept of a right to keep and bear arms was recognized prior to the creation of a written national constitution. When colonists in the Thirteen Colonies rebelled against British control during the American Revolution they cited the 1689 English Bill of Rights as an example.\n\nThe American understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced by the 1689 English Bill of Rights, an Act of Parliament, which also dealt with personal defence by Protestant English subjects.\n\nThe Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King James II, a Roman Catholic, who had forced the disarming of Protestants, while arming and deploying armed Catholics contrary to Law (among other alleged violations of individual rights). The Bill of Rights provided that Protestants could bear arms for their defence as permitted by law. It also established that the power to regulate the right to bear arms belonged to Parliament, not the monarch.\n\nSir William Blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the \"natural right of resistance and self-preservation\", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law.\n\nIn \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the right to arms preexisted the Constitution and in that case and in \"Presser v. Illinois\" (1886) recognized that the Second Amendment protected the right from being infringed by Congress. In \"United States v. Miller\" (1939), the Court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held and, citing the Tennessee case of \"Aymette v State\", indicated that it protected the right to keep and bear arms that are \"part of the ordinary military equipment\" or the use of which could \"contribute to the common defense.\" In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the Second Amendment protects, \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), the Court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right \"to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation,\" not contingent on service in a militia, while indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations, and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Court applied incorporation doctrine to extend the Second Amendment's protections nationwide.\n\nThe people's right to have their own arms for their defense is described in the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle, Cicero, John Locke, Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others. Though possessing arms appears to be distinct from \"bearing\" them, the possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical precursor to the bearing of arms. Don Kates, a civil liberties lawyer, cites historic English usage describing the \"right to keep and bear \"their private arms\".\"\nLikewise, Sayoko Blodgett-Ford notes a non-military usage of the phrase in a pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from the time of the Pennsylvania ratifying convention for the U.S. Constitution:\n\n[T]he people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them, unless for crimes committed...\n\nIn commentary written by Judge Garwood in \"United States v. Emerson\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit concluded in 2001 that:\n\nSimilarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, states:\n\nLikewise, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), No. 07-290, that \"[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\"\n\nSome historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century, the expression \"bear arms\" appeared exclusively in military contexts, as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians.\n\nIn late-eighteenth-century parlance, \"bearing arms\" was a term of art with an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of the Library of Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and early national periods reveals, the thirty uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing arms' in bills, statutes, and debates of the Continental, Confederation, and United States' Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context exclusively focused on the army or the militia.\n\nHowever, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to selection bias, which arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service. Commenting on this previous research, other historians note:\n\nSearching more comprehensive collections of English language works published before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses that...have nothing to do with military service...[and] The common law was in agreement. Edward Christian's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that appeared in 1790s described the rights of Englishmen (which every American colonist had been promised) in these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right was separate from militia duties.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines the term \"to bear arms\" as: \"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight,\" dating to about 1330.\n\nGarry Wills, author and history professor at Northwestern University, has written of the origin of the term \"bear arms\":\n\nBy legal and other channels, the Latin \"\"arma ferre\" entered deeply into the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war \" 'justborne arms\" and a civil war \"self-borne arms\".\" Even outside the special phrase \"\"bear arms\",\" much of the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms (\"sub armis\"), the call to arms (\"ad arma\"), to follow arms (\"arma sequi\"), to take arms (\"arma capere\"), to lay down arms (\"arma pœnere\"). \"Arms\" is a profession that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church. An issue undergoes the arbitrament of arms.\" ... \"One does not bear arms against a rabbit...\".\n\nGarry Wills also cites Greek and Latin etymology:\n\n... \"Bear Arms\" refers to military service, which is why the plural is used (based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre') – one does not bear arm, or bear an arm. The word means, etymologically, 'equipment' (from the root ar-* in verbs like 'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage' of war. Thus 'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare, since the \"profession of arms\" refers to all military callings.\n\nHistorically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully formed in the Bill of Rights in 1791; rather, the Second Amendment was the codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the English Colonists that settled North America, tracing its origin back to the Assize of Arms of 1181 that occurred during the reign of Henry II. Through being codified in the United States Constitution, the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the People, and statutory law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish the pre-existing common law right to keep and bear arms.\n\nThe Second Amendment to the United States Constitution refers to a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms:\n\nThe right is often presented in the United States as being an unenumerated, pre-existing right, such as provided for by the Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution, interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated rights, and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms:\n\nSome have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right to keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee & Michael J. Quinlan, writing in the North Carolina Law Review said \"... Madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment – the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions.\"\n\nAkhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, \"following John Randolph Tucker's famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies v. Illinois\": \n\nThough originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights – common law rights – of the man, they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States... \n\nUviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state. They also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the Constitution has ceased to exist in the United States resulting from deliberate Congressional legislation and also societal neglect; nonetheless, \"Technically, all males aged seventeen to forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that status has no practical legal significance.\"\n\nA few academic writers published their opinions in several works:\n\nFrom the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a personal, individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms. We cannot, however, (as the individual rights contingent generally does) disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state.\n\n...we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: \"Inasmuch as and so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the maintenance thereof, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" \"..to us, the language of the Amendment cannot support a right to personal weaponry independent of the social value of a regulated organization of armed citizens..\nIn the century following the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times. The vast majority of regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was \"Houston v. Moore\", , where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.\n\nIn the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to the Civil War), and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these individuals. Most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the 1857 court case \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\", whether the slave Dred Scott could be a citizen with rights, including the right to bear arms. This debate about the rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear arms' with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess firearms.\n\nIn the \"Dred Scott\" decision, the opinion of the court stated that if African Americans were considered U.S. citizens, \"It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they went.\"\n\nThe Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a federal provision. In 2010, this \"fundamental\" and \"individual\" right was \"fully incorporated\" with the 14th Amendment per the SCOTUS ruling made in \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\", which upheld the prior opinion made in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\". Each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution. Forty-four states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into their state constitutions. Each of the state constitutions, state laws, and state courts addresses the state-based right to bear arms distinctly within its respective jurisdictions. The degree and the nature of the protection, prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to state. The District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the federal jurisdiction.\n\nApproximately thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the right to arms for \"individual right\", \"defense of self\", \"defense of home\" or similarly worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as with the U.S. Constitution, did not choose to explicitly include \"individual\", \"self\" or \"home\" wording associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states.\n\nApproximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the right to bear arms for \"security of a free state\", \"defense of state\", \"common defense\" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S. Constitution. Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly \"free state\", \"defense of state\" or \"common defense\" wording for their specific state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether implicit \"individual\" rights exist, or whether such rights (if any) are implicitly protected by the states' constitutions or by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter of dispute. However, since the SCOTUS has \"fully incorporated\" the 2nd and 14th Amendments in their 2010 opinion and order in \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\", the right to keep and bear arms is \"fully applicable\" to the states and limits the states on any and all regulations and restrictions they choose to take, and federal Constitutional rights take precedence over state, local and other laws that regulate to \"Right of Lawful Citizens to keep and bear Arms for self-defense, a 'central component' of the 2nd Amendment\" (see \"McDonald v. City of Chicago\" (SC 2010)).\n\nRegarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different models have emerged from state jurisprudence: an individual right (defense of self or home) and a collective (defense of the state) right. It should be noted, however, that the states cannot lessen or restrict any Bill of Rights guarantee that has been \"fully incorporated\" (American jurisprudence) and that the right that is \"fully incorporated\" also applies to the respective State Constitutions; again, the states can only \"add to\" these rights but can never \"diminish\" these rights by state and local laws.\n\n\"Bliss v. Commonwealth\" (1822, KY) addressed the right to bear arms pursuant to Art. 10, Sec. 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799): \"That the rights of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.\" This was interpreted to include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane. This case has been described as about \"a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons [that] was violative of the Second Amendment.\" Others, however, have seen no conflict with the Second Amendment by the Commonwealth of Kentucky's statute under consideration in \"Bliss\" since \"The Kentucky law was aimed at concealed weapons. No one saw any conflict with the Second Amendment. As a matter of fact, most of the few people who considered the question at all believed amendments to the U.S. Constitution did not apply to state laws.\"\n\nThe Kentucky High Court stated in \"Bliss\", \"But it should not be forgotten, that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution; it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at the adoption of the constitution; and if any portion of that right be impaired, immaterial how small the part may be, and immaterial the order of time at which it be done, it is equally forbidden by the constitution.\" The \"constitution\" mentioned in this quote refers to Kentucky's Constitution.\n\nThe case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while recognizing that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799) did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms. The \"Bliss\" ruling, to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons, was overturned by constitutional amendment with Section 26 in Kentucky's Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying of concealed weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition has remained to the present day in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution, enacted in 1891, in Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees \"The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons.\" As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1, 1982, p. 155, \"The first state court decision resulting from the \"right to bear arms\" issue was \"Bliss v. Commonwealth\". The court held that \"the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire, ...\" \"This holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified.\"\n\nThe importance of \"Bliss\" is also seen from the defense subsequently given against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in 1852 pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator John Crittenden, former Governor of Kentucky, and former United States Attorney General. The defense successfully defended Ward in 1854 through an assertion that \"a man has a right to carry arms; I am aware of nothing in the laws of God or man, prohibiting it. The Constitution of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee it. The Legislature once passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided unconstitutional, and overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals.\" As noted by Cornell, \"Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in \"Bliss\" and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted.\"\n\nIn \"Aymette v. State\", 21 Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), the Tennessee Supreme Court construed the guarantee in Tennessee's 1834 Constitution that 'the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defence.' Explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as the Federal Constitution's Second Amendment, the court wrote: \"The words 'bear arms' … have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress. As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment.\"\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court ruled in \"Nunn v. Georgia\" (Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. (1 Kel.) 243 (1846)) that a state law banning handguns was an unconstitutional violation of the Second Amendment. This was the first gun control measure to be overturned on Second Amendment grounds. The Supreme Court in its ruling in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" said \"Nunn\" \"perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the Second Amendment furthers the purpose announced in the prefatory clause.\" \n\nThe right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear \"arms\" of every description, and not \"such\" merely as are used by the \"militia\", shall not be \"infringed\", curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this \"right\", originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!\n\nIn \"State v. Buzzard\" (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, \"that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense\", while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard had carried a concealed weapon and stood \"indicted by virtue of the authority of the 13th section of an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person wearing a pistol, dirk, large knife or sword-cane \"concealed as a weapon\", unless upon a journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment.\" Justice Lacy, in a dissenting opinion in \"Buzzard\", summarizing the majority viewpoint to which he disagreed, declared: \n\nThat the words \"a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State\", and the words \"common defense\" clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark. and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms.\"\nJoel Prentiss Bishop's influential \"Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes\" (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the \"Arkansas doctrine\", as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.\n\nPolitical scientist Earl Kruschke has categorized both \"Bliss\" and \"Buzzard\" as being \"cases illustrating the individual view.\" Professor Eugene Volokh revealed, in the California Political Review, that a statement in a concurring opinion in \"Buzzard\" was the only support for a collective right view of the right to keep and bear arms in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1905, the Kansas Supreme Court in \"Salina v. Blaksley\" made the first collective right judicial interpretation. The Kansas high court declared: \"That the provision in question applies only to the right to bear arms as a member of the state militia, or some other military organization provided for by law, is also apparent from the second amendment to the federal Constitution, which says: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'\"\n\nThree models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United States commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing interpretations of the Second Amendment, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech. This view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008) than had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Heller\" there was a split among the federal courts, with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view, two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one federal circuit court having not addressed the question.\n\nThe second two models focus on the preamble, or \"purpose\" clause, of the Amendment – the words \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State.\" The second model, the collective model, holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to individuals, under the belief that the right's only purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia.\n\nThe third model, the modified collective model, holds that the right to keep and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.\n\nSupreme Court justice Antonin Scalia in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations.\n\nNadine Strossen, former president of the American Civil Liberties Union, has stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable regulation. Strossen said \"it is no more absolute than freedom of speech or any other right in the Constitution. No right is absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional strict scrutiny and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance.\"\n\nIn October 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated:\n\nthere are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] \"to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service.\"\n\nIn \"United States v. Miller\", , the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the National Firearms Act prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered Title II weapons:\n\nIn a unanimous opinion authored by Justice McReynolds, the Supreme Court stated \"the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable.\" As the Court explained:\n\nGun rights advocates claim that the Court in \"Miller\" ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of \"ordinary military equipment.\" They also claim that the Court did not consider the question of whether the sawed-off shotgun in the case would be an applicable weapon for personal defense, instead looking solely at the weapon's suitability for the \"common defense.\" Law professor Andrew McClurg states, \"The only certainty about \"Miller\" is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern scholars recognize this fact.\"\n\nAccording to the syllabus prepared by the U.S. Supreme Court Reporter of Decisions, in \"District of Columbia v. Heller\", 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. pp. 2–53.\n\nOther legal summaries of the court's findings in this case are similar.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court in \"McDonald v. Chicago\", 561 U.S. 3025 (2010) held that the Second Amendment was fully incorporated within the 14th Amendment. This means that the court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government. It also remanded a case regarding a Chicago handgun prohibition. Four of the five Justices in the majority voted to do so by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while the fifth Justice, Clarence Thomas, voted to do so through the amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n\nInterest groups, primarily in the United States, exert political pressure for and against legislation limiting the right to keep and bear arms. This political debate in America is organized between those who seek stricter regulations and those who believe gun regulations violate the Second Amendment protection of a right to keep and bear arms. The largest advocacy group in this regard is the National Rifle Association, and its political wing, the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. The NRA has been described as one of the largest and most powerful political special interest groups in the United States. Several other groups including the Gun Owners of America and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, while smaller in size, are also politically active. The main gun control advocacy group is the Brady Campaign which has been described as considerably less effective than gun-rights organizations.\n\n"}
{"id": "252311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252311", "title": "Rule of inference", "text": "Rule of inference\n\nIn logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called \"modus ponens\" takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.\n\nTypically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.\n\nPopular rules of inference in propositional logic include \"modus ponens\", \"modus tollens\", and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.\n\nIn formal logic (and many related areas), rules of inference are usually given in the following standard form:\n\n  Premise#1\n<br>  Premise#2\n<br>        ...\n<br>  Premise#n   \n<br>  Conclusion\n\nThis expression states that whenever in the course of some logical derivation the given premises have been obtained, the specified conclusion can be taken for granted as well. The exact formal language that is used to describe both premises and conclusions depends on the actual context of the derivations. In a simple case, one may use logical formulae, such as in:\n\nThis is the \"modus ponens\" rule of propositional logic. Rules of inference are often formulated as schemata employing metavariables. In the rule (schema) above, the metavariables A and B can be instantiated to any element of the universe (or sometimes, by convention, a restricted subset such as propositions) to form an infinite set of inference rules.\n\nA proof system is formed from a set of rules chained together to form proofs, also called \"derivations\". Any derivation has only one final conclusion, which is the statement proved or derived. If premises are left unsatisfied in the derivation, then the derivation is a proof of a \"hypothetical\" statement: \"\"if\" the premises hold, \"then\" the conclusion holds.\"\n\nIn a Hilbert system, the premises and conclusion of the inference rules are simply formulae of some language, usually employing metavariables. For graphical compactness of the presentation and to emphasize the distinction between axioms and rules of inference, this section uses the sequent notation (formula_4) instead of a vertical presentation of rules.\n\nThe formal language for classical propositional logic can be expressed using just negation (¬), implication (→) and propositional symbols. A well-known axiomatization, comprising three axiom schemata and one inference rule (\"modus ponens\"), is:\n\nIt may seem redundant to have two notions of inference in this case, ⊢ and →. In classical propositional logic, they indeed coincide; the deduction theorem states that \"A\" ⊢ \"B\" if and only if ⊢ \"A\" → \"B\". There is however a distinction worth emphasizing even in this case: the first notation describes a deduction, that is an activity of passing from sentences to sentences, whereas \"A\" → \"B\" is simply a formula made with a logical connective, implication in this case. Without an inference rule (like \"modus ponens\" in this case), there is no deduction or inference. This point is illustrated in Lewis Carroll's dialogue called \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\" , as well as later attempts by Bertrand Russel and Peter Winch to resolve the paradox introduced in the dialogue.\nFor some non-classical logics, the deduction theorem does not hold. For example, the three-valued logic of Łukasiewicz can be axiomatized as:\n\nThis sequence differs from classical logic by the change in axiom 2 and the addition of axiom 4. The classical deduction theorem does not hold for this logic, however a modified form does hold, namely \"A\" ⊢ \"B\" if and only if ⊢ \"A\" → (\"A\" → \"B\").\n\nIn a set of rules, an inference rule could be redundant in the sense that it is \"admissible\" or \"derivable\". A derivable rule is one whose conclusion can be derived from its premises using the other rules. An admissible rule is one whose conclusion holds whenever the premises hold. All derivable rules are admissible. To appreciate the difference, consider the following set of rules for defining the natural numbers (the judgment formula_5 asserts the fact that formula_6 is a natural number):\n\nThe first rule states that 0 is a natural number, and the second states that s(n) is a natural number if \"n\" is. In this proof system, the following rule, demonstrating that the second successor of a natural number is also a natural number, is derivable:\n\nIts derivation is the composition of two uses of the successor rule above. The following rule for asserting the existence of a predecessor for any nonzero number is merely admissible:\n\nThis is a true fact of natural numbers, as can be proven by induction. (To prove that this rule is admissible, assume a derivation of the premise and induct on it to produce a derivation of formula_10.) However, it is not derivable, because it depends on the structure of the derivation of the premise. Because of this, derivability is stable under additions to the proof system, whereas admissibility is not. To see the difference, suppose the following nonsense rule were added to the proof system:\n\nIn this new system, the double-successor rule is still derivable. However, the rule for finding the predecessor is no longer admissible, because there is no way to derive formula_12. The brittleness of admissibility comes from the way it is proved: since the proof can induct on the structure of the derivations of the premises, extensions to the system add new cases to this proof, which may no longer hold.\n\nAdmissible rules can be thought of as theorems of a proof system. For instance, in a sequent calculus where cut elimination holds, the \"cut\" rule is admissible.\n\n"}

The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:\n\n\nItem lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the SFI Group System.\n\nA purchase is normally charged to a finance account (cost type) and to a SFI Group System number, often called a technical account (cost center).\n\nWhen purchasing components, a yard may specify the individual item by the SFI Detail Code (6 digits). When a shipping company orders spare parts, these may be identified by the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers (total of 9-10 digits).\n\nWhen components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.\n\nThe spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:\n\nAn operation and maintenance system will often contain a register covering all maintenance units on board. These units are normally identical to the components in the Detail Code:\n\n731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1\nMaker:\nType:\nSerial no.:\nCapacity:\n\nProcedures for preventive maintenance and class survey of a maintenance unit will be entered with job identification:\n\n731.001.01 - Starting air compressor no. 1\nJob A - 3000 hours routine\nJob B - Class survey\n\nAll records of preventive and corrective maintenance should be filed and related to the maintenance unit. The technical accounts of planned maintenance systems such as AMOS Maintenance and Procurement are commonly based on the SFI Group System.\n\nRepair specifications are often based on information from the maintenance system. The repair bill should follow the repair specification structure. It is customary for the yard to quote prices to the shipping company at subgroup level.\n\nThe SFI Group System is used for budgeting of maintenance and repair work, and for spare part consumption. In order to make a complete operation budget in a shipping company, it is necessary to link the Group System to a plan of finance accounts. Any suitable plan of finance accounts may be used together with SFI.\n\nThe plan of finance accounts usually covers spare parts and consumable items. Budgeting of spare parts may be performed in great detail using the SFI Group System.\n\nCost control of new building or repair work is normally carried out at the tertiary Group and Detail Code levels. Direct purchases are charged to the SFI Detail Code:\n\nMaterials:\nReporting of working hours is normally carried out at the tertiary group level. Activities and jobs must be established to follow up work progress.\n\nMaterials:\nIn relation to ISO 9000 and IMO requirements for safe operation, it is necessary to establish procedures that ensure that specification requirements and rules and regulations from authorities and classification societies are met, and that the ship/rig is operated safely.\n\nThe following procedures and instructions should be classified according to SFI:\n\nThe SFI Group System is often used as a standard filing system for the shipping and offshore industry. SFI gives this industry a well structured and organized filing system for drawings, manuals, reports, and publications.\n\nThe SFI Group System is built up as a 3-digit decimal classification system. The ship/rig is divided into 10 Primary Groups from 0 to 9. Only Primary Groups 1 to 8 are in use. The users may use Primary Groups 0 and 9 for classifying other main components that are not covered by the SFI standard.\n\nEach of the Primary Groups (1st digit) consists of 10 Groups (2nd digit) and each Group is divided further into 10 subgroups (3rd digit).\nThe Primary Groups (1st digit) of SFI for Ships is described below.\n\nDetails and costs that cannot be charged to any specific function on board, e.g. general arrangement, quality assurance, launching, dry-docking and guarantee \nwork.\n\nHull, superstructure and material protection of the vessel.\n\nCargo equipment and machinery including systems for vessel’s cargo, loading/discharging systems, cargo winches and hatches.\n\nShip specific equipment- and machinery. Navigational equipment, manoeuvring machinery, anchoring equipment, and communication equipment. This group also includes special equipment such as equipment for fishing.\n\nEquipment, machinery, systems etc. serving crew and passengers, for example lifesaving equipment, furniture, catering equipment and sanitary systems.\n\nPrimary components in the engine room, for example main and auxiliary engines, propellers, plant, boilers, and generators.\n\nSystems serving main machinery components, for example fuel and lubrication oil systems, starting air system, exhaust systems and automation systems.\n\nCentral ship systems, for example ballast and bilge systems, fire fighting and wash down systems, electrical distribution systems etc.\n\nThe detail and material codes cover components and materials that may be related to the individual subgroups. In order to reach the component level, it might be necessary to break the subgroups further down by using a detail code. This code has not yet been possible to standardize due to the variety of equipment and numbers onboard different types of ships, and due to slightly different requirements to the code for shipyards and shipping companies.\n\nUsually there are two different classes of components and material that are used; one class comprises components and material that are ordered directly to a ship, the other comprises components and material that are ordered to stock. Consequently, the codes are divided into two parts:\n\nDetail Code: Components that are purchased directly to order/ship. The detail code is used to define the individual component and equipment that acts in the sub system function. In the Detail Code the supplementary codes are built up from 001-099.\n\nMaterial Code: This code relates to material that is purchased to stock.\nThe relations between these codes are as follows:\n\nAn SFI User License Certificate must be purchased from SpecTec to use the SFI Group System. One license fee will be charged for each SFI installation. This means that one license is required for each ship/site/rig that uses the coding structure of SFI. There are additional charges for each book, file or database.\n\nThe SFI manuals are available in the following formats:\nThe A4, A5, and Letter manuals contain the following parts:\nThe A6 pocket manual contains:\n\nA classification system such as the SFI Group System will make a substantial contribution to standardized and well-ordered information related to ships/rigs, and will lead to improved communication both within a company and with external parties.\n\nThe SFI Group System will make shipping and offshore operations more efficient because companies will save resources and avoid pitfalls when implementing the SFI standards. SFI can be the common denominator tying together all functions of shipping and offshore operations such as maintenance, purchasing, accounting, filing etc.\n\nThe following websites may also be helpful:\n"}

Many of the pathogenic serovars of the \"S. enterica\" species are in this subspecies, including that responsible for typhoid.\n\n\"S. enterica\" subsp. \"enterica\" contains a large number of serovars which can infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts. The individual members range from being highly host-adapted (only able to infect a narrow range of species) to displaying a broad host range. A number of techniques are currently used to differentiate between serotypes. These include looking for the presence or absence of antigens, phage typing, molecular fingerprinting and biotyping, where serovars are differentiated by which nutrients they are able to ferment. A possible factor in determining the host range of particular serovars is phage-mediated acquisition of a small number of genetic elements that enable infection of a particular host. It is further postulated that serovars which infect a narrow range of species have diverged from ancestors with a broad host range, and have since specialised and lost the ability to infect some hosts.\n\nA selection of serovars, with known hosts listed. Since there are more than 2500 serovars of \"Salmonella enterica\" subsp. \"enterica\", this list is incomplete.\n\nA study of data from 37 countries collected between 2001 and 2007 found that the most common serovar of \"Salmonella\" isolated from human cases was Enteritidis, found in an average of 43.5% of cases, followed by Typhimurium (17.1% of cases), Newport (3.5%), Infantis (1.8%), Virchow (1.5%), Hadar (1.5%), and Agona (0.8%).\n\nOne strain of \"Salmonella\" that has recently been emerging in the United States is \"Salmonella javiana\". \"An outbreak occurred in 2002, there were 141 cases that occurred among the participants of the U.S. Transplant Games. Out of the 141 cases, most of the cases were either transplant recipients (34%) or people receiving immunosuppressive therapy (32%)\". There is an increasing number of \"Salmonella\" serotypes that are multidrug resistant (MDR), which was identified by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System. \"\"Salmonella javiana\" causes 4% of nontyphodial \"Salmonella\" infections in the United States each year.\"\n\nIn November 2016, a new strain of extensively drug resistant (XDR) \"Salmonella enterica\" serovar Typhi emerged in Pakistan, primarily from the cities of Hyderabad and Karachi. Multidrug resistant strains have been present since the late 1970s in Africa and Asia. These XDR strains are resistant to all antibiotic treatment options: chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and third-generation cephalosporins. The outbreak has been ongoing since 2016.\n\nGenetic evidence suggests that the serovars can be divided into two groups – one which causes enteric infection and has a broad repertoire of metabolic capabilities, and one which usually causes invasive infection, often in a narrow range of hosts, and shows degradation of anaerobic metabolic pathways. It is thought that these metabolic capabilities are important for obtaining nutrients in the challenging and nutrient-limited inflamed gut environment.\n\nThe serovars can be designated fully or in a shortened form. The short form lists the genus, \"Salmonella\", which is followed by the capitalized and non-italicized serovar. The full designation for \"Salmonella\" Typhi is \"Salmonella enterica\" subsp. \"enterica\", serovar Typhi. Each serovar can have many strains, as well, which allows for a rapid increase in the total number of antigenically variable bacteria.\n\nInvasive strains of non-typhoidal salmonella, such as \"Salmonella\" Typhimurium ST313 have recently been labelled as causing emerging diseases in Africa. Key host immune deficiencies associated with HIV, malaria and malnutrition have contributed to a wide spread of this disease and the need to use expensive antimicrobial drugs in the poorest health services in the world. But also bacterial factors, such as upregulated activity of the virulence gene \"pgtE\", due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in its promoter region, have been shown to have a great impact upon the pathogenesis of this particular \"Salmonella\" sequence type.\n"}
{"id": "2772118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2772118", "title": "Self-consciousness", "text": "Self-consciousness\n\nSelf-consciousness is a heightened sense of self-awareness. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of self-awareness, which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being, though the two terms are commonly used interchangeably or synonymously. An unpleasant feeling of self-consciousness may occur when one realizes that one is being watched or observed, the feeling that \"everyone is looking\" at oneself. Some people are habitually more self-conscious than others. Unpleasant feelings of self-consciousness are sometimes associated with shyness or paranoia.\n\nWhen feeling self-conscious, one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's own actions. Such awareness can impair one's ability to perform complex actions. \nAdolescence is believed to be a time of heightened self-consciousness. A person with a chronic tendency toward self-consciousness may be shy or introverted.\n\nUnlike self-awareness, which in a philosophical context is being conscious of oneself as an individual, self-consciousness, being excessively conscious of one's appearance or manner, can be a problem at times. Self-consciousness is often associated with shyness and embarrassment, in which case a lack of pride and low self-esteem can result. In a positive context, self-consciousness may affect the development of identity, for it is during periods of high self-consciousness that people come the closest to knowing themselves objectively. Self-consciousness affects people in varying degrees, as some people are constantly self-monitoring or self-involved, while others are completely oblivious about themselves.\n\nPsychologists frequently distinguish between two kinds of self-consciousness, private and public. Private self-consciousness is a tendency to introspect and examine one's inner self and feelings. Public self-consciousness is an awareness of the self as it is viewed by others. This kind of self-consciousness can result in self-monitoring and social anxiety. Both private and public self-consciousness are viewed as personality traits that are relatively stable over time, but they are not correlated. Just because an individual is high on one dimension doesn't mean that he or she is high on the other.\n\nDifferent levels of self-consciousness affect behavior, as it is common for people to act differently when they \"lose themselves in a crowd\". Being in a crowd, being in a dark room, or wearing a disguise creates anonymity and temporarily decreases self-consciousness (see deindividuation). This can lead to uninhibited, sometimes destructive behavior.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3730967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3730967", "title": "Sibling rivalry", "text": "Sibling rivalry\n\nSibling rivalry is a type of competition or animosity among siblings, whether blood related or not.\n\nSiblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, birth order, personality, and people and experiences outside the family. Sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender and/or where one or both children are intellectually gifted.\n\nAccording to observational studies by Judith Dunn, children are sensitive from the age of one year to differences in parental treatment. From 18 months on siblings can understand family rules and know how to comfort and be kind to each other. By the age of 3, children have a sophisticated grasp of social rules, can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings, and know how to adapt to circumstances within the family.\n\nSibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents. Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped to physically, intellectually, and emotionally hurt and be intellectually and emotionally hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings as a way to get parental attention may increase in adolescence. One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.\n\nSibling rivalry can continue into adulthood, and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Events such as a parent’s illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.\n\nAccording to Kyla Boyse from the University of Michigan, each child in a family competes to define who it is as an individual and wants to show that it is separate from its siblings. Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents’ attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight most in families where there is neither any understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts nor any alternative way of handling such conflicts; in families in which physical fighting is forbidden but no method of non-physical conflict resolution (\"e.g.\", verbal argument) is permitted, the conversion and accumulation of everyday disputes into long-simmering hostilities can have an effect nearly as corrosive. Stress in the parents’ and children’s lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.\n\nAlfred Adler saw siblings as \"striving for significance\" within the family and felt that birth order was an important aspect of personality development. In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.\n\nDavid Levy introduced the term \"sibling rivalry\" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling \"the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life.\" Researchers today generally endorse this view, noting that parents can ameliorate this response by being vigilant to favoritism and by taking appropriate preventative steps. In fact, say researchers, the ideal time to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of supportive relationships between siblings is during the months prior to the new baby's arrival.\n\nParents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children, planning fun family activities together, and making sure each child has enough time and space of their own. They can also give each child individual attention, encourage teamwork, refuse to hold up one child (such as the oldest) as a role model for the others (such as the younger children), and avoid favoritism. Teaching the children positive ways to ask for attention from parents when they need it can also make it less likely that they will resort to aggressive attention-getting strategies. Eileen Kennedy-Moore notes that this remedy also requires that parents \"catch children being good\" by responding to children's kind, helpful, and creative bids for attention. Additionally, by being proactive about teaching children emotional intelligence, problem solving skills, negotiation skills and encouraging them to look for win-win solutions, parents can help children resolve conflicts that arise as a normal part of growing up together in the same household. A concerted effort by parents to reduce competitiveness while nurturing bonding can further help alleviate sibling rivalry.\n\nHowever, according to Sylvia Rimm, although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.\n\nWeihe suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questioned and/or questionable behavior is rivalry or sibling abuse. First, given that children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages, one must rule out the possibility that the questioned behavior is in fact age-appropriate for the child exhibiting it. Second, one must determine whether the behavior is an isolated incident or instead part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements. Third, one must determine if there is an \"aspect of victimization\" to the behavior: rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal, and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questioned and/or questionable behavior: while rivalry is motivated entirely or primarily by aspects of a child's self-interest in which the interests of others, including the child's rival, do not play a role, in scenarios featuring abuse the perpetrator's ultimate interests tend to include domination, humiliation, or at least embarrassment of the victim.\n\nSibling rivalry is common among various animal species, in the form of competition for food and parental attention. An extreme type of sibling rivalry occurs when young animals kill their siblings. For example, a black eagle mother lays two eggs, and the first-hatched chick pecks the younger one to death within the first few days. In the blue-footed booby, there is always the emergence of a brood hierarchy. The dominant chick will attack the subordinate one in times of food scarcity, often pecking it repeatedly or driving it from the nest. Among spotted hyenas, sibling competition begins as soon as the second pup is born, and 25% of pups are killed by their siblings. (see: Siblicide)\n\nSibling relationships in animals are not always competitive. For example, among wolves, older siblings help to feed and guard the young.\n\nThe Book of Genesis in the Bible contains several examples of sibling rivalry: the story of Cain and Abel tells of one brother's jealousy after God appears to favour his sibling, and the jealousy ultimately leads to murder. Esau was jealous of his brother Jacob's inheritance and blessing; sisters Leah and Rachel compete for the love of Jacob; Joseph's brothers are so jealous that they effectively sell him into slavery. The following are also present in the Qur'an and the Torah.\n\nA number of Shakespeare's plays display the incidences of sibling rivalry. King Lear provokes rivalry among his three daughters by asking them to describe their love for him; in the same play, Edmund contrives to force his half-brother Edgar into exile. In \"The Taming of the Shrew\", sisters Kate and Bianca are shown fighting bitterly. In \"Richard III\", the title character is at least partially motivated by rivalry with his brother, King Edward. In \"As You Like It\", there is obvious sibling rivalry and antagonism between Orlando and Oliver, and also between Duke Frederick and Duke Senior.\n\nMost adaptations of Sherlock Holmes depicts sibling rivalry with his brother, Mycroft Holmes.\n\nIn John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden\", the brothers Cal and Aron Trask are counterparts to Cain and Abel of the Bible story.\n\n\"A Song of Ice and Fire\" contains numerous examples, such as that between Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon. After their eldest brother Robert Baratheon's death they contend for the Iron Throne, Stannis finally killing Renly through dark magic, though it is left unclear whether he is aware of his role in Renly's death. The history of Westeros also contains \"The Dance of the Dragons\", in which Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen fought over the Iron Throne after their father Viserys I Targaryen's death, Aegon eventually killing Rhaenyra, but being poisoned shortly after, leading to Rhaenyra's son Aegon III becoming King.\n\nSibling rivalry is a common theme in media that features child characters, reflecting the importance of this issue in early life. These issues can include jealousy on the birth of a new baby, different sibling roles, frequent arguments, competitiveness for mother's affection, and tensions between step-siblings.\n\nAdult siblings can also be portrayed with a rivalrous relationship, often a continuation of childhood conflicts. Situation comedies exploit this to comic effect. Sibling relationships may be shown as alternately loving and argumentative. Brothers or sisters in a similar line of work may display professional rivalry. In serious drama, conflict between siblings can be fatal, as shown in crime dramas involving such rivalries.\n\nOccasionally real life instances of sibling rivalry are publicized in the mass media. Siblings who play the same sport will often be compared with each other; for example, American football players Peyton and Eli Manning, or tennis players Venus and Serena Williams. Musicians Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis are portrayed as having a turbulent relationship, similar to that of Ray and Dave Davies of The Kinks. Politicians Ed and David Miliband are likewise portrayed as having a strained relationship.\n\nActresses Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine had an uneasy relationship from childhood and in 1975 the sisters stopped speaking to each other completely. The incredibly popular singing Andrews Sisters maintained professional harmony in show business for more than 30 years, but clashed famously in their personal lives (after LaVerne's death in 1967, Patty and Maxene stopped speaking in 1975 and never looked back). The rivalry between singers Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle is often talked about in the Indian media, in spite of their insistence that these are just tales. Twin sisters and advice columnists Ann Landers and Abigail Van Buren had a relationship that was alternately very close and publicly antagonistic. Journalists Christopher and Peter Hitchens had many public disagreements and at least one protracted falling-out due to their differing political and religious views.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "201503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201503", "title": "Social status", "text": "Social status\n\nSocial status is the relative respect, competence, and deference accorded to people, groups, and organizations in a society. Some writers have also referred to a socially valued role or category a person occupies as a \"status\" (e.g., being a criminal or mentally ill). At its core, status is about who members of a society consider to hold more social value. These beliefs about who is more or less valued (e.g., honorable, respectable, smart) are broadly shared among members of a society. As such, people use status hierarchies to decide who gets to \"call the shots,\" who is worthy, and who deserves access to valuable resources. In so doing, these shared cultural beliefs make unequal distributions of resources and power appear natural and fair, supporting systems of social stratification. Status hierarchies appear to be universal across human societies, affording valued benefits to those who occupy the higher rungs, such as better health, social approval, resources, influence, and freedom.\n\nStatus hierarchies depend primarily on the possession and use of status symbols. These are cues people use to determine how much status a person holds and how they should be treated. Such symbols can include possession of socially valuable attributes, like being conventionally beautiful or having a prestigious degree. Wealth and the display of it through conspicuous consumption can for instance be indicators of status. Status in face-to-face interaction can also be conveyed through certain controllable behaviors, such as assertive speech, posture, and emotional displays.\n\nSome perspectives on status emphasize its relatively fixed and fluid aspects. Ascribed statuses are fixed for an individual at birth, while achieved status is determined by social rewards an individual acquires during his or her lifetime as a result of the exercise of ability and/or perseverance. Examples of ascribed status include castes, race, and beauty among others. Meanwhile, achieved statuses are akin to one's educational credentials or occupation: these things require a person to exercise effort and often undergo years of training. The term master status has been used to describe the status most important for determining a person's position in a given context.\n\nStatus refers to the relative rank that an individual holds; this includes attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle, in a social hierarchy based upon honor or prestige. Status has two different types that come along with it: achieved, and ascribed. The word status refers to social stratification on a vertical scale.\n\nIn modern societies, occupation is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as ethnic group, religion, gender, voluntary associations, fandom, hobby) can have an influence.\nAchieved status is when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements. This status can be achieved through education, occupation, and marital status. Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society's bar, which often judges them on success, success being financial, academic, political and so on. America most commonly uses this form of status with jobs. The higher you are in rank the better off you are and the more control you have over your co-workers.\n\nIn pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid and class based, such as with the Indian caste system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some Hunter-Gatherer societies such as the Khoisan, and some Indigenous Australian societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a Khoisan man is expected to take his wife's mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special \"status\" over anyone except her son-in-law—and only then in specific contexts. All societies have a form of social status.\n\nStatus is an important idea in social stratification. Max Weber distinguishes status from social class, though some contemporary empirical sociologists combine the two ideas to create socioeconomic status or SES, usually operationalised as a simple index of income, education and occupational prestige.\n\nSocial status hierarchies have been documented in a wide range of animals: apes, baboons, wolves, cows/bulls, hens, even fish, and ants. Natural selection produces status-seeking behavior because animals tend to have more surviving offspring when they raise their status in their social group. Such behaviors vary widely because they are adaptations to a wide range of environmental niches. Some social dominance behaviors tend to increase reproductive opportunity, while others tend to raise the survival rates of an individual’s offspring. Neurochemicals, particularly serotonin, prompt social dominance behaviors without need for an organism to have abstract conceptualizations of status as a means to an end. Social dominance hierarchy emerges from individual survival-seeking behaviors.\n\nStatus inconsistency is a situation where an individual's social positions have both positive and negative influences on his or her social status. For example, a teacher may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little money, which simultaneously decreases their status.\n\nStatuses based on inborn characteristics, such as ethnicity, are called ascribed statuses, while statuses that individuals gained through their own efforts are called achieved statuses. Specific behaviors are associated with social stigmas, which can affect status.\n\nAscribed status is when one's position is inherited through family. Monarchy is a widely recognized use of this method, to keep the rulers in one family. This usually occurs at birth without any reference as to how that person may turn out to be a good or bad leader.\n\nStatus can be changed through a process of social mobility. Social mobility is change of position within the stratification system. A move in status can be upward (upward mobility), or downward (downward mobility). Social mobility allows a person to move to another social status other than the one he or she was born in. Social mobility is more frequent in societies where achievement rather than ascription is the primary basis for social status.\n\nSocial mobility is especially prominent in the United States in the late 20th century, with an ever-increasing number of women entering into the workplace as well as a steady increase in the number of full-time college students. This increased education as well as the massive increase in multiple household incomes has greatly contributed to the rise in social mobility obtained by so many today. With this upward mobility; however, comes the philosophy of \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" that so many Americans obtain. Although this sounds good on the surface, it actually poses a problem because millions of Americans are in credit card debt due to conspicuous consumption and purchasing goods that they do not have the money to pay for.\n\nSocial stratification describes the way people are placed or \"stratified\" in society. It is associated with the ability of individuals to live up to some set of ideals or principles regarded as important by the society or some social group within it. The members of a social group interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification. Such ties between people are often fluid and amorphous. Some of the more common bases for such ranking include:\n\nGroups:\n\nThe German sociologist Max Weber developed a theory proposing that stratification is based on three factors that have become known as \"the three p's of stratification\": property, prestige and power. He claimed that social stratification is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German \"Stand\") and power (party).\nMax Weber developed various ways that societies are organized in hierarchical systems of power. These ways are social status, class power and political power.\nThere has been discussion about how Weber's three dimensions of stratification are more useful for specifying social inequality than more traditional terms like Socioeconomic Status.\n\nMax Weber developed the idea of \"status group\" which is a translation of the German \"Stand\" (pl. \"Stände\"). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged. Status groups can include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and other groups for which pattern association.\n\nThe French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu developed theories of social stratification based on aesthetic taste in his work \"Distinction\". Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social space to the world, one's aesthetic dispositions, depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that these dispositions are internalized at an early age and guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and an aversion towards other lifestyles.\n\nBourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and cultural capital. Society incorporates \"symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence, […as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction\". Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that \"differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes\".\n\nAesthetic dispositions are the result of social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time. The acquisition of cultural capital depends heavily on \"[t]otal, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life\". Bourdieu hypothetically guarantees that the opinions of the young are those that they are born into, the accepted \"definitions that their elders offer them\".\n\nHe asserts the primacy of social origin and cultural capital by claiming that social capital and economic capital, though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that \"one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions\".\n\nAccording to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation, are indicators of class, because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual's fit in society. Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. A multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction \"has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator or tailor.\"\n\nBourdieu does not wholly disregard the importance of social capital and economic capital in the formation of cultural capital. In fact, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument \"presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means…and spare time\". However, regardless of one's ability to act upon one's preferences, Bourdieu specifies that \"respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate... culture\".\n\n\"[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a 'sense of one's place', guiding the occupants of a given... social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position\". Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences.\n\nThese \"cognitive structures…are internalized, 'embodied' social structures\", becoming a natural entity to the individual. Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in \"disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance ('sick-making') of the tastes of others.\"\n\nBourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are \"most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste\". Indeed, Bordieu believes that \"the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning\" would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are \"an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in 'showing off' a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part)\". The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their class fractions.\n\nChildren from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose \"heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap\" in their dinner layouts, opting for \"plentiful and good\" meals as opposed to foods that are \"original and exotic\". These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu's \"ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy,\" that contrasts the \"convivial indulgence\" characteristic of the lower classes. Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.\n\nThe degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. In fact, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one's social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor \"economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending\". This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability consumption patterns remain stable.\n\n"}

It was based on the young, unmarried woman in the plantation-owning upper class of Southern society. \nThe image of a Southern belle is often characterized by fashion elements such as a hoop skirt, a corset, pantalettes, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and gloves. As signs of tanning were considered working-class and unfashionable during this era, parasols and fans are also often represented.\n\nSouthern belles were expected to marry respectable young men, and become ladies of society dedicated to the family and community. The Southern belle archetype is characterized by Southern hospitality, a cultivation of beauty, and a flirtatious yet chaste demeanor.\n\nFor example, Sallie Ward, who was born into the Southern aristocracy of Kentucky in the Antebellum South, was called a Southern belle.\n\nThe Southern belle archetype has been criticized as part of an overall idealization of the Antebellum era American South in popular culture. Slavery figured strongly into the region's economy during the plantation era. In turn, the image of the idyllic Southern plantation is considered by many to be insensitive to the plight of slaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American science fiction author and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed \"Sturgeon's law\", it is the \"ninety percent crap\" remark that is usually referred to by that term.\n\nThe phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of works in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.\n\nA similar adage appears in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Light that Failed\", published in 1890. \"Four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake.\"\n\nThe first written reference to the adage appears in the March 1958 issue of \"Venture\", where Sturgeon wrote:\n\nI repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.\n\nAccording to Philip Klass (William Tenn), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at New York University attended by Tenn. The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 Labor Day weekend session of the World Science Fiction Convention in Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2013, philosopher Daniel Dennett championed Sturgeon's law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking. \"90% of everything is crap. That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine—you name it—rock music, country western. 90% of everything is crap.\" Its re-introduction to a modern audience received a positive reception, according to Dennett.\n\nSturgeon had originally deemed Sturgeon's law to mean that \"nothing is always absolutely so\" in the story \"The Claustrophile\" in a 1956 issue of \"Galaxy\". The second adage, variously rendered as \"ninety percent of everything is crud\" or \"ninety percent of everything is crap\", was originally known as \"Sturgeon's Revelation\", formulated as such in his book review column for \"Venture\" in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's law actually refer to the second, including the definition listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\n\n\n"}

The word has also been used by Antonin Artaud and Jacques Derrida commented its use. The subjectile is seen as a theory, not a fact; as a theory the subjectile is a tool that can be employed to analyse art objects to generate hypotheses concerning the relationship between subject and object in art.\n\nDerrida mentions that the word 'subjectile' appears in an essay on Pierre Bonnard, published in 1921. The subjectile refers to Bonnard’s use of cardboard for painting.\nThe Concise French dictionary translates 'subjectile' as 'Art: support (beneath paint, etc.)'. Without a support and ground the subject of a painting could not exist as it would fall away. Derrida argues that Artaud's subjectile is both ground and a support. It is stretched out, extended, beyond, through and behind the subject, it is not alien to the subject, yet ‘It has two situations’. Derrida holds that the subjectile functions as a hypothesis, and is a subjectile itself. ‘Subjectile, the word or the thing, can take the place of the subject or of the object – being neither one nor the other.’\n\nAntonin Artaud mentions the subjectile three times in his writing.Jacques Derrida, in his essay, \"To Unsense the Subjectile\" states ‘All three times, he is speaking of his own drawings, in 1932, 1946, and 1947’. The first time Artaud used the word was in a letter to André Rolland de Renéville, ‘Herewith a bad drawing in which what is called the subjectile betrayed me.’ In 1946, ‘This drawing is grave attempt to give life and existence to what until today had never been accepted in art, the botching of the subjectile, the piteous awkwardness of forms crumbling around an idea after having for so many eternities labored to join it. The page is soiled and spoiled, the paper crumpled, the people drawn with the consciousness of a child.’ Finally in February 1947, ‘The figures on the inert page said nothing under my hand. They offered themselves to me like millstones which would not inspire the drawing, and which I could cut. Scrap, file, sew, unsew, slash, and stitch without the subjectile ever complaining through father or through mother.’\n\nJacques Derrida's essay was first published in French titled \"Forcener le Subjectile\" in 1986 by Gallimard and an abridged English translation was published later (in 1998 by MIT press). For copyright reasons the images published in the Gallimard book were excluded from the later English translation, which contains instead photographs of Artaud taken by Georges Pastier in 1947, the year before Artaud died.\n\nThe subjectile is also commented on by Susan Sontag in her introduction to the edited translation of Artaud's works. and further in \"The Antonin Artaud Critical Reader\", which includes texts by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, and Susan Sontag.\n\nListen to Antonin Artaud's radio play, \"To Have Done with the Judgement of God\" originally banned from broadcast in 1947.\n"}
{"id": "3570630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3570630", "title": "Svatantrya", "text": "Svatantrya\n\nSvātantrya (from the Sanskrit \"sva\" meaning \"self\" and \"tantram\" meaning \"dependence\" – 'self-dependency', or 'free will') is the Kashmiri Shaivite concept of divine sovereignty. \"Svātantrya\" is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (\"Paramaśiva\"), a wave of motion inside consciousness (\"spanda\") that acts as the fundament of the world, or in another view, the original word (logos, pārāvak). It does not use any external instrument as it itself is the first stage of creation.\n\nIn antithesis with the Vedantic concept of Brahman, which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or \"maya\" of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (\"Śiva\") by the means of his irresistible will-force (\"Svātantrya\"). This is an important aspect of the Pratyabhijna school of \"Kashmir Shaivism\".\n\n\"Svātantrya\" is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism, like, the divine sovereignty of \"Śiva\" (God), consciousness (\"caitanya\"), creative power (\"vimarśa\"), mantric efficiency and \"Kundalini\".\n\nIn its acception of divine sovereignty, \"svātantrya\" is described as an absolute power of action, or, absolute power of freedom. This power arises from the mirror-like ability of the supreme consciousness (\"caitanya\") to contain images (\"vimarśa\") – the whole universe being a mere image shining inside this unique god-consciousness.\n\n\"Svātantrya\" has a number of traditional attributes such as: perfect fullness (of the energy of will), self-sufficiency, autodetermination, the power of doing and undoing – essence of the subject, supreme creativity, sovereignty, source of knowledge (\"jñāna\") and action (\"kriyā\") and being beyond contradictions: it exists beyond laws of any kind and is the source of all laws in the universe.\n\nThe Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of \"Śiva\". Thus, the world has no external causes outside \"Śiva's Svātantrya\". This power creates multiplicity (\"māyā\") from the original unity of the absolute, and as such, it exists inside and beyond \"māyā\". It is the seed of the universe, the matrix (\"mātrkā\") of generative phonemes, the ultimate creative force.\n\nDisclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness.\n\nThe \"prakāśa-vimarśa\" theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (\"prakāśa\") and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (\"vimarśa\"). To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (\"ānanda\") – thus, free will (\"svātantrya\"), conscious reflection (\"vimarśa\") and bliss (\"ānanda\") are three concepts describing the same reality. Bliss (\"ānanda\") is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svātantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.\n\nSvātantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation The first creation of \"svātantrya\" is the energy of will (\"icchā śakti\"). Then come the energies of knowledge (\"jñāna śakti\") and action (\"kriyā śakti\") and together with the energy of consciousness (\"cit śakti\") and the energy of bliss (\"ānanda śakti\") they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called \"pure creation\".\n\nEverything related to consciousness is also related to \"svātantrya\". Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (\"vaikharī\"), mental (\"madhyamā\"), subtle (\"paśyanti\") and supreme (\"parā\"). \"Svātantrya\" is equated to \"pārāvak\", the creative logos / \"logos spermatikos\".\n\nIn the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, \"svātantrya\" is both the sovereign will of \"Śiva\", solely deciding the descent of divine grace (\"śaktipāt\") and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as \"pure witness\", \"non-dual consciousness\" or \"atma-vyapti\"). Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (\"ānanda\") and to control the energies (\"śakti\") and the mantras (or, the so-called \"śiva-vyāpti\"). The root of spiritual efficiency is \"svātantrya\", the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute.\n\nAn adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of \"svātantrya\". Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. \"Svātantrya\" being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice.\n\nThe will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of \"Śiva\". Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad) – and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of karma yoga.\n\nAll the spiritual paths (\"upāyas\"): that of Śiva (\"śāmbhavopāya\"), that of Śakti (\"śāktopāya\") and that of the man (\"āṇavopāya\") are subsumed under the umbrella of \"svātantrya\" as it is the sole mediator of divine grace. The adept who has attained \"svātantrya\" is beyond the need for formal meditation – that is – for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical – he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with \"Śiva\" from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice. Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of \"Śiva\" at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of Kundalini. His mantras have spiritual efficacy. His heart (\"hṛdaya\") is the receptacle of all objects.\n\nKashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel \"Śiva\" to bestow the final spiritual realization – it is solely based on the unconditioned \"svātantrya\", or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with \"Śiva\" because he has \"svātantrya\" which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything. Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel \"Śiva\" to liberate his self (\"ātman\"). Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility.\n\nIn a meditation prescribed in Vijñana Bhairava Tantra, one is supposed to unite his vital energy (\"prāṇa\") with \"svātantrya\" in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, \"dvadaśānta\".\n\n\"Svātantrya\" has a number of synonyms such as: \"maheśvaraya\" (from maheśvara which means supreme lord), or \"aiśvarya\" (similarly, from the word Iśvara which also means Lord). It has been personalized as the Goddess (\"Devi\"), the virginal feminine deity \"Uma\" (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world) and the playful goddess \"Kumārī\". Other scriptures also refer to \"svātantrya\" as the \"Glory of Siva\" on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (\"prakāśa\") and cosmic bliss (\"ānanda\") – \"cidānanda-Ghana\".\n"}

He often used this term in his book, \"A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története\", e.g. in the chapter \"A kárpát-medencei rovásábécé korabeli feljegyzése\" (\"The contemporary record of the Carpathian Basin Rovas alphabet\").\n\nVékony analysed the similarities and the differences between the Old Hungarian and the Carpathian Basin scripts on page 154 of his book. On page 232, Vékony wrote: \"- Aethicus Ister jelei azonosak az egykori Kárpát-medencei rovásírás jeleivel.\" (\"The symbols of Aethicus Ister are identical to the symbols of the quondam Carpathian Basin script\").\n\nVékony also writes : \"E jel a Szarvason azonosított Kárpát-medencei f alig torzult megfelelője...\" (\"This symbol is identical to the Carpathian Basin 'f' identified in Szarvas\". (referring to the bone needle case found in Szarvas)\n\nIn page 233, Vékony writes: \"Erre utalhat az is, hogy ez a betűalak levezethető egy párthus alep formából. Feltehető tehát ennek a jelnek a megléte a Kárpát-medencei rovásírásban is (a székelybe is innen származhatott).\" (\"This could imply also that this glyph can be derived from the Parthian Aleph form. Consequently, the existence of this symbol can be supposed in the Carpathian Basin script as well (it could originate from this to the Székely).\" Here the 'Szekely' refers to the \"Szekely-Hungarian Rovas\" script also known as Old Hungarian script. Vékony's writing suggests a proposal that a Carpathian Basin Rovas script may be one of the ancestors of the Szekely-Hungarian Rovas script.\n\nGábor Vékony's transcription was improved by linguist Erzsébet Zelliger. The last character of the fourth row of the inscription was reconstructed by Vékony. The edges of the bone needle case are worn, and the top and bottom edges for part of the characters are not clearly visible.\n\nThe following transcription using the International Phonetic Alphabet is based on Vékony's original transcription. Superscript segments and those in brackets are reconstructed.\n\nIn the inscription, the third symbol of the third row (from left) could be considered a descendant of the ideograms in Turkic languages. However, their possible relationship needs further evidence.\n\nVékony had read the Szarvas transcription as Hungarian, thus proposing it as evidence that the Hungarian-speaking people had appeared in the region by the 7th century. There are several critics of Vékony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian linguist and historian, András Róna-Tas. The debates were summarized by István Riba in 1999 and 2000: \"many find themselves unable to accept Vékony's theory\".\n\nThe key point of the critics has been that in traditional Hungarian scholarship, the existence of the Hungarian-speaking population dates from 896 (when the Magyars took over the Carpathian Basin ), while the Szarvas needle case dates from the 8th century. Consequently, either the Szarvas inscription is not in Hungarian or Hungarians were in the Carpathian Basin much earlier than the late 9th century. Róna-Tas attempted to read the Szarvas relic in Turkic instead of Hungarian, but wrote that his transcription needed further improvement. The issue remains an open question amongst Hungarian scholars.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1936310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1936310", "title": "Two-line element set", "text": "Two-line element set\n\nA two-line element set (TLE) is a data format encoding a list of orbital elements of an Earth-orbiting object for a given point in time, the \"epoch\". Using suitable prediction formula, the state (position and velocity) at any point in the past or future can be estimated to some accuracy. The TLE data representation is specific to the simplified perturbations models (SGP, SGP4, SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8), so any algorithm using a TLE as a data source must implement one of the SGP models to correctly compute the state at a time of interest. TLEs can describe the trajectories only of Earth-orbiting objects. TLEs are widely used as input for projecting the future orbital tracks of space debris for purposes of characterizing \"future debris events to support risk analysis, close approach analysis, collision avoidance maneuvering\" and forensic analysis.\n\nThe format was originally intended for punch cards, encoding a set of elements on two standard 80-column cards. This format was eventually replaced by text files with each set of elements written to two 70-column ASCII lines. The United States Air Force tracks all detectable objects in Earth orbit, creating a corresponding TLE for each object, and makes available TLEs for non-classified objects on the website Space Track. The TLE format is a \"de facto\" standard for distribution of an Earth-orbiting object's orbital elements.\n\nA TLE set may include a title line preceding the element data, so each listing may take up three lines in the file. The title is not required, as each data line includes a unique object identifier code.\n\nThe two-line format traces its history to seminal work by Max Lane in the early 1960s to develop mathematical models for predicting the locations of satellites based on a minimal set of data elements. His first paper on the topic, published in 1965, introduced the Analytical Drag Theory, which concerned itself primarily with the effects of drag caused by a spherically-symmetric non-rotating atmosphere. Joined by K. Cranford, the two published a greatly improved model in 1969 that added various harmonic effects due to Earth-Moon-Sun interactions and various other inputs.\n\nLane's models were widely used by the military and NASA starting in the late 1960s. The improved version became the standard model for NORAD in the early 1970s, which ultimately led to the creation of the TLE format. At the time there were two formats designed for punch cards, an \"internal format\" that used three cards encoding complete details for the satellite (including name and other data), and the two card \"transmission format\" that listed only those elements that were subject to change. The latter saved on cards and produced smaller decks when updating the databases.\n\nCranford continued to work on the modelling, eventually leading Lane to publish \"Spacetrack Report #2\" detailing the Air Force General Perturbation theory, or AFGP4. The paper also described two simplified versions of the system, IGP4 which used a simplified drag model, and SGP4 (Simplified General Perturbations) which used IGP4's drag model along with a simplified gravity model. The differences between the three models were slight for most objects. One year later, \"Spacetrack Report #3\" was released, included full FORTRAN source code for the SGP4 model. This quickly became the \"de facto\" standard model, both in the industry as well as the astronomy field.\n\nShortly after the publication of \"Report #3\", NASA began posting elements for a variety of visible and other well known objects in their periodic \"NASA Prediction Bulletins\", which consisted of the transmission format data in printed form. After trying for some time to convince NASA to release these in electronic form, T.S. Kelso took matters into his own hands and began manually copying the listings into text files which he distributed through his CelesTrak bulletin board system. This revealed a problem in NASA's checksum system, which traced back to the lack of the plus character (+) on the teletype machines used at NASA, which ultimately turned out to be a problem from the punch card era that occurred when NORAD updated from the BCD to EBCDIC character set on the computer sending out the updates. This problem went away when Kelso began to receive data directly from NORAD in 1989.\n\nThe SGP4 model was later extended with corrections for deep space objects, creating SDP4, which used the same TLE input data. Over the years a number of more advanced prediction models have been created, but these have not seen widespread use. This is due to the TLE not containing the additional information needed by some of these formats, which makes it difficult to find the elements needed to take advantages of the improved model. More subtly, the TLE data is massaged in a fashion to improve the results when used with the SGP series models, which may cause the predictions of other models to be less accurate than SGP when used with common TLEs. The only new model to see widespread use is SGP8/SDP8, which were designed to use the same data inputs and are relatively minor corrections to the SGP4 model.\n\nOriginally there were two data formats used with the SGP models, one containing complete details on the object known as the \"internal format\", and a second known as the \"transmission format\" that was used to provide updates to that data.\n\nThe internal format used three 80-column punch cards. Each card started with a card number, 1, 2 or 3, and ended with the letter \"G\". For this reason, the system was often known as the \"G-card format\". In addition to the orbital elements, the G-card included various flags like the launching country and orbit type (geostationary, etc.), calculated values like the perigee altitude and visual magnitude, and a 38-character comments field.\n\nThe transmission format is essentially a cut-down version of the G-card format, removing any data that is not subject to change on a regular basis, or data that can be calculated using other values. For instance, the perigee altitude from the G-card is not included as this can be calculated from the other elements. What remains is the set of data needed to update the original G-card data as additional measurements are made. The data is fit into 70 columns and does not include a trailing character. TLEs are simply the transmission format data rendered as ASCII text.\n\nAn example TLE for the International Space Station:\n\nThe meaning of this data is as follows:\n\n\n\nWhere decimal points are assumed, they are leading decimal points. The last two symbols in Fields 10 and 11 of the first line give powers of 10 to apply to the preceding decimal. Thus, for example, Field 11 (-11606-4) translates to -0.11606E-4 (−0.11606×10).\n\nThe checksums for each line are calculated by adding all numerical digits on that line, including the line number. One is added to the checksum for each negative sign (−) on that line. All other non-digit characters are ignored.\n\nFor a body in a typical low Earth orbit, the accuracy that can be obtained with the SGP4 orbit model is on the order of 1 km within a few days of the epoch of the element set. The term \"low orbit\" may refer to either the altitude (minimal or global) or orbital period of the body. Historically, the SGP algorithms defines low orbit as an orbit of less-than 225 minutes.\n"}

This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class codice_1 and a type variable codice_2, and means that codice_2 can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with codice_1.\n\nType classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language, and were originally conceived as a way of implementing overloaded arithmetic and equality operators in a principled fashion.\nIn contrast with the \"eqtypes\" of Standard ML, overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system.\n\nSince their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.\n\nThe programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class codice_5 intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:\nclass Eq a where\nThe type variable codice_2 has kind formula_1 (also known as codice_7 in the latest GHC release), meaning that the kind of codice_5 is\nEq :: Type -> Constraint\nThe declaration may be read as stating a \"type codice_2 belongs to type class codice_5 if there are functions named codice_11, and codice_12, of the appropriate types, defined on it.\" A programmer could then define a function codice_13 (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way:\nelem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool\nelem y [] = False\nelem y (x:xs) = (x == y) || elem y xs\nThe function codice_13 has the type codice_15 with the context codice_16, which constrains the types which codice_2 can range over to those codice_2 which belong to the codice_5 type class. (\"Note\": Haskell codice_20 can be called a 'class constraint'.)\n\nA programmer can make any type codice_21 a member of a given type class codice_22 by using an \"instance declaration\" that defines implementations of all of codice_22's methods for the particular type codice_21. For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type codice_21, they may then make this new type an instance of codice_5 by providing an equality function over values of type codice_21 in whatever way they see fit. Once they have done this, they may use the function codice_13 on codice_29, that is, lists of elements of type codice_21.\n\nNote that type classes are different from classes in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, codice_5 is not a type: there is no such thing as a \"value\" of type codice_5.\n\nType classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of codice_13 as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type codice_15 were it not for the type class constraint \"codice_35\".\n\nA type class need not take a type variable of kind codice_7 but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as codice_37, rather than data constructors such as codice_38). An example is the codice_39 class:\nclass Monad m where\nThe fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind codice_40, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of codice_39 is thus:\nMonad :: (Type -> Type) -> Constraint\nType classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types. For example, in the GHC standard library, the class codice_42 expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint codice_43 means that codice_2 is an array type that contains elements of type codice_45. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement unboxed array types, for example.)\n\nLike multimethods, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime; rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.\n\nHaskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard. The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and Hugs, support multi-parameter type classes.\n\nIn Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters—a concept inspired from relational database theory. That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, general monads codice_46 which carry a state parameter of type codice_47 satisfy the type class constraint codice_48. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency codice_49. This means that for a given monad, the state type accessible from this interface is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in type inference, as well as aiding the programmer in type-directed programming.\n\nSimon Peyton-Jones has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.\n\nType classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same. A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as:\n\ncan be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of codice_50:\n\nThe instance codice_51 is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of codice_52. (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.)\n\nHowever, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more \"flexible\" – you can pass different instances of codice_53. In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called \"coherence\" property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type. The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged. On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.\n\nAs an example, an ordered set (of type codice_54) requires a total ordering on the elements (of type codice_2) in order to function. This can be evidenced by a constraint codice_56, which defines a comparison operator on the elements. However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order. Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of codice_56 to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes). Thus, enforcing coherence of codice_56 in this particular scenario is crucial.\n\nInstances (or \"dictionaries\") in Scala type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity. While these instances are by default supplied by finding appropriate instances in scope to be used as the implicit actual parameters for explicitly-declared implicit formal parameters, the fact that they are ordinary values means that they can be supplied explicitly, to resolve ambiguity. As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.\n\nThis is an example taken from the Cats documentation:\n// A type class to provide textual representation\ntrait Show[A] {\n\n// A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit \n// instance of Show[A] available\ndef log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))\n\n// An instance for String\nimplicit val stringShow = new Show[String] {\n\n// The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler.\nscala> log(\"a string\")\na string\n\nCoq (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances. Recent versions of Agda 2 also provide a similar feature, called \"instance arguments\".\n\nIn Standard ML, the mechanism of \"equality types\" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class codice_5, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler. The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.\n\nSML's and OCaml's modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for \"ad hoc\" polymorphism.\nThe object oriented subset of OCaml is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.\n\nAn analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in GHC) is that of type family.\n\nRust supports traits, which are a limited form of type classes with coherence.\n\nMercury has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell. \n\nIn Scala, type classes are a programming idiom which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone.\n\nThe proof assistant Coq has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.\n\n\n"}
