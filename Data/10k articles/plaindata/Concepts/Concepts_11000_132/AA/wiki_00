{"id": "19146397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19146397", "title": "Adroitness", "text": "Adroitness\n\nSocial adroitness is a personality trait measured in the Jackson Personality Inventory and the Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised. Adroitness is not explicitly measured by these tests, but rather the characteristics are measured through different scales.\n\nAdroitness assesses the ability to regulate your own behavior in order to get what you want from others. It differs from psychopathy in that the adroitness is not intrinsically narcissistic or manipulative, but refers rather to the set of social skills that allow one to work with others productively. In that sense it is closely related to conceptions of emotional intelligence.\n\nTools of adroit behavior include flattery, indirection, listening, circumspection, reciprocal altruism, politeness and strategic reasoning.\n\nThe Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised (JPI-R) is widely considered to be one of the most psychometrically sound measures of personality. In one convenient form, the JPI-R provides a measure of personality that reflects a variety of social, cognitive, and value orientations, which affect an individual's functioning.\n\nThe JPI-R was originally based on Murray's theory of needs.\n\nAdroitness is defined by its characteristics and behaviors. Example behaviors include:\n\n\nDiderot's Encyclopedie offers an early modern perception of adroitness, which in the following quotation is referred to as social finesse. In the quote below it describes the difference between finesse and delicacy.\n\n\"Finesse is not entirely the same thing as subtlety. You lay out a trap with finesse, you escape from it with subtlety; your conduct is fine or neatly turned out, you play a subtle trick; if you always act with finesse, you inspire distrust. It’s always a mistake to find finesse in everything. Finesse in works of the mind, as in conversation, consists in the art of not expressing your thought directly, while letting it be easily understood: it’s an enigma that witty people immediately solve. Once, when the Chancellor offered his protection to a high court, the chief justice said, turning towards his colleagues, “Gentlemen, let us give thanks to the Lord Chancellor, he’s giving us more than we ask him for;” [4] that répartie is a very fine one. Finesse in conversation or in writing is not the same thing as delicacy; the former can be applied equally to witty and pleasant things, to blame and even to praise, even to indecent things that are covered by a veil through which you can see them without blushing. You can say bold things with finesse . Delicacy is used to express pleasant and gentle feelings, fine bits of praise; finesse is therefore used rather in an epigram, delicacy in a madrigal. Delicacy is contained in lovers’ jealousies; finesse is not. The praises that Despréaux [5] sang to Louis XIV are not always equally delicate; [6] his satires are not always fine enough. When Iphigenia in Racine’s tragedy receives the order from her father not to see Achilles any more, she cries out: Sweeter gods, you had asked only for my life. [7] The true character of this line is rather delicacy than finesse .\"\n\nIn general, people exhibiting this trait understand how to get the most out of people, often through indirect means.\n\nAs stated above, the adroitness trait is indirectly measured by the second and third clusters on the Jackson Personality Inventory-Revised, or JPI-R. The second cluster is the extroverted cluster, which contains the sociability, social confidence, and energy level scales. The third cluster is the emotional cluster, which contains the empathy, anxiety, and cooperativeness scales. Specifically, the sociability, empathy, and cooperativeness scales of the JPI-R measure adroitness.\nThe Five Factor Model, or FFM, measures adroitness through the extroversion and agreeableness clusters.\n\nAdroitness is often compared to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism, as all three can be measured by similar scales on personality inventories.\n\nPsychopathy is a series of behaviors that loosely correspond with the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, or ASPD. Psychopathy is made up of two parts, aggressive narcissism and a parasitic lifestyle, while ASPD only accounts for the narcissistic personality. \nPsychopathy is similar to adroitness in that the manipulation of others is an important factor. Psychopathy is considered a negative trait, while adroitness is considered a neutral trait. The difference lies in the intent of the manipulation. Psychopaths manipulate others for their own benefit or amusement, or to harm another person. People exhibiting the adroitness trait manipulate others in order to help other people and almost never intend to harm anyone.\n\nMachiavellianism resembles psychopathy in the intent of the manipulation. It does not include the impulsive and dangerous behaviors associated with psychopathy. Machiavellianism is often found in the realm of political theory.\n\nAs previously stated, adroitness is not clearly measured as a specific personality trait, but is instead measured by different scales and clusters.\nMost personality inventories have some measure of honesty built in. Traits like psychopathy and Machiavellianism are usually measured as negative honesty traits. While adroitness is considered a positive trait compared to these two, the inherent manipulation makes it almost impossible to accurately place it on an honesty scale, which may account for why it is not more specifically measured on personality inventories.\n\nBecause many of the behaviors associated with adroitness are similar to some of the behaviors associated with psychopathy, experiments that delve into the mind of the psychopath can shed light onto some of the brain function involved with the adroitness trait. In 2008, fMRI testing showed that psychopaths are impaired in basic emotional and cognitive functions. Because these functions are controlled by the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobes of the brain, there must be some problem in these areas. Due to the aforementioned similarities, it follows that people expressing the adroitness trait may also have some kind of problem or damage in these parts of the brain. \nThe cognitive functions of psychopaths and controls in this study were tested through the use of the Simon paradigm. This test measures reaction time based on stimulus and response locations. In the Müller et al. study, the stimuli were an X and an O, both of which appeared at different locations on a screen. The participant was required to respond by tapping the right side of a separate screen with their middle finger for X and on the left side with their index finger for O. In the control group, as the task became more difficult, negative emotion interfered with cognition. Essentially, as people became angrier, it became more difficult to accurately complete the task. However, as the psychopaths became angrier, their performance did not change, suggesting that there is a disconnect between the emotional process and cognitive abilities in the psychopathic brain.\nIf psychopaths have trouble connecting emotion to the thinking process, the perhaps those with the adroitness trait do as well. Certainly the ability to manipulate others requires a substantial amount of effort, regardless of emotion. The resource allocation model suggests that negative emotions worsen cognitive performance on difficult tasks because they drain resources that are required for cognitive processes. Manipulation and persuasion are cognitive processes that require a lot of effort due to the number of things that require focus. The art of manipulation requires some element of dishonesty as well as a significant knowledge of both the target as well as the purpose of manipulation, or the ability to fabricate important details. These elements are also required for persuasion. It follows that these processes must require a significant amount of effort, and therefore emotions, especially negative ones, would take resources away from those processes. \nManipulation and persuasion can also be very stressful tasks. Stress is known to cause negative emotions, which are shown to interfere in complex cognitive processes. Therefore, people who express the adroitness trait may suffer from similar damage to the prefrontal cortex and/or temporal lobe as psychopaths.\n"}

{"id": "17509149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17509149", "title": "Andriana", "text": "Andriana\n\nAndriana refers to both the noble class and a title of nobility in Madagascar. Historically, many Malagasy ethnic groups lived in highly stratified caste-based social orders in which the \"andriana\" were the highest strata. They were above the Hova (free commoner castes) and Andevo (slaves). The Andriana and the Hova were a part of \"Fotsy\", while the Andevo were \"Mainty\" in local terminology.\n\nThe Andriana strata originally constituted the nobility, warrior, and land owning class of the Merina society. They were endogamous and their privileges were institutionally preserved. While the term and concept of Andriana is studied with the Merina people of Madagascar, the term is not limited to them. The use of the word \"Andriana\" to denote nobility occurs among numerous other Malagasy ethnic groups such as the Betsileo, the Betsimisaraka, the Tsimihety, the Bezanozano, the Antambahoaka and the Antemoro. \"Andriana\" often traditionally formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes, and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests its origin is traceable back to an ancient Javanese nobility title, although alternate theories have been proposed.\n\nAccording to K.A. Adelaar, the Malagasy title \"andriana\" probably originated from the ancient Java-Indonesian nobility title \"Rahadyan\" (\"Ra-hady-an\"), \"hady\" meaning \"Lord\" or \"Master.\" In Malagasy the term became \"Rohandryan\" and later \"Roandriana\", mainly used in the Southeastern part of the island among the Zafiraminia, Antemoro and Antambahoaka ethnic groups. In the central Highlands among the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and Sihanaka, the term became \"Randryan\" and later \"Randriana\" or simply \"andriana\".\n\nOther proposed etymology for \"Andriana\" includes the root \"Handrina\" which means \"head or forehead\" in Malagasy.\n\nIn Madagascar, the name of a Malagasy sovereign, prince or nobleman was often historically composed by placing \"Andriana\" as a prefix to the remainder of the name. For example, the name of Merina king Andrianampoinimerina is a composite of \"\"Andriana\" and \"Nampoinimerina\", while that of the celebrated Sakalava warrior Andriamisara is formed from \"Andriana\" and \"Misara\"\".\n\nIn Madagascar today, names beginning with the \"Andria\" prefix are common. However, unlike in Western cultures where children automatically inherit the family name of a parent, Malagasy parents are free to choose their child's first and last name as they please. Following the end of the monarchy in Imerina, many parents have chosen to give their children names including the \"Andriana\" prefix, despite lacking any family connection to the former aristocracy.\n\nAustronesian people started settling in Madagascar between 200 to 500 CE. They arrived by boats and were from various southeast Asian groups. African slaves were brought to the island's coasts between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The Portuguese traders were the first Europeans to arrive in the 15th century, followed by other European powers.\n\nThis influx of diverse people led to various Malagasy sub-ethnicities in the mid-2nd millennium. The Merina were probably the early arrivals, though this is uncertain and other ethnic groups on Madagascar consider them relative newcomers to the island. The Merina people's culture likely mixed and merged with the Madagascar natives named \"Vazimba\" about whom little is known. According to the island's oral traditions, the \"most Austronesian looking\" Merina people reached the interior of the island in the 15th century and established their society there because of wars and migrant pressure at the coast. Merina people were settled in the central Madagascar, formed one of the three major kingdoms on the island by the 18th century – the other two being Swahili-Arab influenced Sakalava kingdom on the west-northwest and Austronesian Betsimisaraka kingdom on the east-northeast.\n\nThe term \"Hova\" originally applied to all members of the Merina people who arrived in the central highlands around the 15th century and absorbed the existing population of Vazimba. Andriamanelo (1540–1575) consolidated the power of the Hova when he united many of the Hova chiefdoms around Antananarivo under his rule. The term Hova remained in use through the 20th century, though some foreigners transliterated that word to be \"Ankova\", and increasingly used since the 19th century.\n\nIn and after the 16th century, slaves were brought into Madagascar's various kingdoms, and social strata emerged in Merina kingdom. The Hova emerged as the free commoners caste below the nobles hierarchy. During the rule of King Andriamanelo, a subset of Hova related to the king by blood came under the title \"Andriana\". The social structure of the new kingdom became further defined under his son Ralambo (1575–1612), who further subdivided the Andriana into four ranks, and eventually six sub-castes by King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710).\n\nKing Andriamanelo (1540–1575) is credited with establishing the Andriana as a separate class in early Merina society. This class was sub-divided into four groups by his son, the King Ralambo (1575–1600):\n\n\nAnd further it was divided into six groups by Ralambo's great-great-grandson King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710) based on locality and genealogical proximity to the ruling family. The andriana class was divided again into seven groups by King Andrianampoinimerina (1778-1810). In rank order, these groups are:\n\n\nThe Andriana caste were originally the source of nobility and they specialized in the rituals and warrior occupations in the Merina society. However, in 19th century when Merina conquered the other kingdoms and ruled most of the island, a much larger army was needed, and the soldiers then included the Hova caste as well.\n\nThe Andriana benefited from numerous privileges in precolonial Madagascar. Land ownership in Imerina was reserved for the andriana class, who ruled over fiefs called \"menakely\". The populace under the rule of an andriana lord owed him—and the king—a certain amount of free labor each year (\"fanompoana\") for public works such as the construction of dikes, rice paddies, roads and town walls. Posts of privilege within the government, such as judges or royal advisers, were likewise reserved for certain groups of andriana.\n\nThe \"valiha\", the national instrument of Madagascar, was originally an instrument of the masses but came to be affiliated with the noble class in the 19th century. The valiha featured heavily in the music of the Merina royal court performed at palaces such as Ambohimanga or the Rova at Antananarivo. The strings of the valiha were more easily plucked with the fingernails, which were commonly grown long for this purpose; long fingernails became fashionable and symbolic of belonging to the andriana class within the Kingdom of Imerina.\n\nAt Antananarivo, only andriana tombs were allowed to be constructed within town limits. Hovas (freemen) and slaves were required to bury their dead beyond the city walls. The highest ranks of andriana were permitted to distinguish their tombs by the construction of a small, windowless wooden tomb house on top of it, called a \"trano masina\" (sacred house) for the king and \"trano manara\" (cold house) for the Zanakandriana, Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona. This tradition may have originated with King Andriantompokoindrindra, who is said to have ordered the first \"trano masina\" to be built on his tomb in honor of his memory.\n\nAndriana were also subjected to certain restrictions. Marriage outside the caste was forbidden by law among the lowest three ranks of andriana. A high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man would take on her husband's lower rank. Although the inverse situation would not cause a high-ranking man to lose status, he would be unable to transfer his rank or property to his children. For these reasons, intermarriage across andriana caste divisions was relatively infrequent.\n\nThe Andriana, the Hova and the Andevo strata were endogamous in the Merina society. According to the colonial era missionary William Ellis memoir in 1838, an Andriana in the Malagasy society was prohibited from marrying a Hova or a Andevo. The exception, stated Ellis, was the unmarried Queen who could marry anyone from any strata including the Hova, and her children were deemed to be royal. In contrast, Sandra Evers states that the social taboo on inter marriage was weaker between the Andriana and Hova, but strong against that between Andriana and Andevo. The social mores and restrictions on inter-marriage between social strata were historically present among other Malagasy ethnic groups.\n\nThe Andriana, along with the other castes, played an important part in the independence of Madagascar. For instance, Joseph Ravoahangy-Andrianavalona, a Merina nationalist and deputy, was andriana of the Andriamasinavalona sub-caste. The secret nationalist organization V.V.S. (\"Vy Vato Sakelika\") was composed of some Andriana of the intelligentsia. A 1968 study showed that 14% of the population of Imerina was Andriana.\n\nThe andriana have been key players in Madagascan political and cultural life after independence as well. The andriana were deeply affected by the 1995 destruction of the royal palace, the Rova, in Antananarivo, and their approval and participation were periodically solicited throughout the reconstruction process.\n\nIn 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar promoted the revival of a Christian andriana monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.\n\nIn 2016, the London School of Economics enrolled their first Andriana, making them the first Malagasy royal to join the ranks of LSE's famous alumnus. It has been reported that they are directly descended from Queen Rabodozafimanjaka, wife of King Andrianampoinimerina and daughter of King Andriantsimitoviaminandriana who ruled the Merina Kingdom.\n\nMuch of the known genealogical history of the Andriana of Imerina comes from Father François Callet's book \"Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara\" (\"History of the Nobles\"). This collection of oral tradition about the history of the Merina Dynasty was originally written in Malagasy and published between 1878 and 1881. Callet summarized and translated it in French under the title \"Tantara ny Andriana (Histoire des rois)\" in 1908. Tantara ny Andriana constitutes the core material for the historians studying the Merina history, and has been commented, criticised, and challenged ever since by historians from Madagascar, Europe, and North America. For examples, refer to Rasamimanana (1930), Ravelojaona \"et al.\" (1937), Ramilison (1951), Kent (1970), Berg (1988) or Larson (2000). The work is complemented by oral traditions of other tribes collected by Malagasy historians.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "276005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276005", "title": "Asylum seeker", "text": "Asylum seeker\n\nAn asylum seeker (also rarely called an asylee) is a person who flees his or her home country, enters another country and applies for asylum, i.e. the right to international protection, in this other country. An asylum seeker may be a refugee, a displaced person, but not a migrant, such as an economic migrant. Migrants are not asylum seekers. A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and becomes an officially recognised refugee or whether asylum is refused and the person becomes an illegal immigrant who has to leave the country again and may even be deported. The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if the person's circumstances fall into the definition of \"refugee\" according to the \n1951 Refugee Convention or other refugee laws, such as the European Convention on Human Rights – if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are rejected varies from country to country and year to year.\n\nThe terms asylum seeker and refugee are often confused: an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated. On average, about 1 million people seek asylum on an individual basis every year.\n\nNon-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries. As their immigration policy often focuses on the fight of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border controls it deters displaced persons from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim. The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force asylum seekers to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry.\n\nIn recent years, the public as well as policy makers of many countries are focussing more and more on refugees arriving through third country resettlement and pay less and less attention to asylum seekers and those who have already been granted refugee status but did not come through resettlement. Asylum seekers may be even referred to as \"queue jumpers\", because they did not wait for their chance to be resettled\n\nSome countries offer \"asylum visas\" which are a safe and legal way to reach the country where asylum will be claimed. Many countries don't offer that, which is why many people take large risks for entering these countries. In many countries asylum can only be claimed on arrival in the country:\n\nAsylum as an institution is not restricted to the category of individuals who qualify for refugee status. Rather on the contrary, this institution predates the birth of the international regime for the protection of refugees.\n\nAs at 1 July 2013, there were 145 parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention and 146 to the 1967 Protocol. These states are bound by an obligation under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol. The refugee definitions of 1951 and 1967 are the strictest and most exclusive and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status. Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted complementary forms of protection, if they fall within other refugee definitions.\n\nThe practical determination of whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country. In some countries the refugee status determination (RSD) is done by the UNHCR. The burden of substantiating an asylum claim lies with the claimant, who must establish that they qualify for protection.\n\nIn many countries, Country of Origin information is used by migration officials as part of the assessment of asylum claims, and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports. Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions, finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases - and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims, so that the decision of one adjudicator is consistent with what their colleagues decide.\n\nThe refugee definition of the 1951 Convention is universally binding, but there are many other definitions according to which protection may be offered to people who do not fall within this definition.\n\nSubsidiary protection is an international protection for persons seeking asylum, but do not qualify as refugees. It is an option to get asylum for those who do not have a well founded fear of persecution (which is required for refugee status according to the 1951 Convention), but do indeed have a substantial risk to be subjected to torture or to a serious harm if they are returned to their country of origin, for reasons that include war, violence, conflict and massive violations of human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Union law have a broader definition of who is entitled to asylum.\n\nTemporary protection visas are used to persons in Australia who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival. It is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities and they are required to reapply for it every three years.\n\nAsylum seekers may be given refugee status on a group basis. Refugees who went thought the group status determination are also referred to as prima facie refugees. This is done in situations when the reasons for seeking refugee status are generally well known and individual assessment would otherwise overwhelm the capacities of assessors. Group determination is more readily done in states that not only have accepted the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention, but also use a refugee definition that includes people fleeing indiscriminate or generalized violence, which are not covered in the 1951 Convention.\n\nFor persons who do not come into the country as part of a bigger group individual asylum interviews are conducted to establish whether the person has sufficient reasons for seeking asylum.\n\nIn many countries, asylum applicants can challenge a rejection by challenging the decision in a court or migration review panel. In the United Kingdom, more than one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection are overturned by immigration judges.\n\nWhilst waiting for a decision asylum seekers have limited rights in the country of asylum. In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer. In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country. Even access to health care is limited. In the European Union, those who have yet to be granted official status as refugees and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access. This includes access to medical and psychological care. However, these may vary depending on the host country. For instance, under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act in Germany, asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to emergency health care, vaccinations, pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care. Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population. They also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapists relative to the German general population.\n\nBecause asylum seekers often have to wait for months or years for the results of their asylum applications and because they are usually not allowed to work and only receive minimal or no financial support destitution is a considerable risk.\n\nAsylum seekers usually get some kind of support from governments whilst their application is processed. However, in some countries this support ends immediately once they are given refugee status. But the fact that they were given refugee status does not mean that they were already given all the documents they need for starting their new lives. Because of these circumstances, some refugees are forced to sleep rough and beg for money or, if they’re lucky, rely on the generosity of charities and friends for food and shelter.\n\nIt often happens that the country neither recognizes the refugee status of the asylum seekers nor sees them as legitimate migrants and thus treats them as illegal aliens. If an asylum claim has been rejected, the asylum seeker is said to be refused asylum, and called a failed asylum seeker. Some failed asylum seekers are allowed to remain temporarily, some return home voluntarily home and some are forcibly returned. The latter are most often placed in immigration detention before being deported.\n\nEven though asylum wasn't granted the applicant may be given the right to remain temporarily. In the UK refused cases may be granted humanitarian protection (usually for 5 years) or discretionary leave to remain.\n\nRefugees cannot be deported or otherwise forced to go back to their country of origin as this would be refoulement, which is against international law. But in many cases failed asylum seekers, i.e. who failed to be considered as refugees, are equally vulnerable and may face significant risks when going back, voluntarily or not.\n\nIf asylum seekers have serious medical problems or it is not safe for them to return to their country of origin it is against international law to deport them. However, sometimes they are deported even though they face risks there and it is not safe for them to return. UK authorities have been accused of paying insufficient attention to medical evidence of torture in some cases.\n\nDeportees may be separated from their families who can temporarily or permanently continue to remain in the country; younger persons may not have been to their country of origin for most of their lives, may not even be able to speak the language, don't know anyone and have no connection whatsoever with that country, apart from the formality of having been born there; they may be traumatised through experiences made in detention; they may be detained again as soon as they enter their country of origin; they may even be persecuted. For example, many failed asylum seekers who were returned to Congo (DRC) in 2011 were imprisoned, tortured, forced to pay a ransom, raped or subjected to sexual harassment after their return.\n\nAsylum seekers who have committed crimes against peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity, or other serious non-political crimes, or whose actions are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, are excluded from international protection.\n\n"}
{"id": "8553751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8553751", "title": "Biological organisation", "text": "Biological organisation\n\nBiological organization is the hierarchy of complex biological structures and systems that define life using a reductionistic approach. The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from atoms to biospheres. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an ecological organization concept, or as the field, hierarchical ecology.\n\nEach level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational complexity, with each \"object\" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit. The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of \"emergence\"—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.\n\nThe biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of scientific research, particularly in the medical sciences. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various physical and chemical phenomena to diseases and physiology (body function). For example, fields such as cognitive and behavioral neuroscience could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of pharmacology could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the ecological levels as well. For example, DDT's direct insecticidal effect occurs at the subcellular level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple ecosystems. Theoretically, a change in one atom could change the entire biosphere.\n\nThe simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:\n\nMore complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of elements, and an atom can be further divided into subatomic particles (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, genomes can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of genes.\n\nEach level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as \"emergent properties\".\n\nEvery organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree. An organism can not be organised at the histological (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.\n\nEmpirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity.

It is used by many IR systems to this day. The BIR is based on Boolean logic and classical set theory in that both the documents to be searched and the user's query are conceived as sets of terms. Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms. \n\nAn \"index term\" is a word or expression\",\" which may be stemmed, describing or characterizing a document, such as a keyword given for a journal article. Letformula_1be the set of all such index terms. \n\nA \"document\" is any subset of formula_2. Letformula_3be the set of all documents. \n\nA \"query\" is a Boolean expression formula_4 in normal form:formula_5where formula_6 is true for formula_7 when formula_8. (Equivalently, formula_4 could be expressed in disjunctive normal form.)\n\nWe seek to find the set of documents that satisfy formula_4. This operation is called \"retrieval\" and consists of the following two steps:\n\nLet the set of original (real) documents be, for example\n\nwhere\n\nformula_18 = \"Bayes' principle: The principle that, in estimating a parameter, one should initially assume that each possible value has equal probability (a uniform prior distribution).\"\n\nformula_19 = \"Bayesian decision theory: A mathematical theory of decision-making which presumes utility and probability functions, and according to which the act to be chosen is the Bayes act, i.e. the one with highest subjective expected utility. If one had unlimited time and calculating power with which to make every decision, this procedure would be the best way to make any decision.\"\n\nformula_20 = \"Bayesian epistemology: A philosophical theory which holds that the epistemic status of a proposition (i.e. how well proven or well established it is) is best measured by a probability and that the proper way to revise this probability is given by Bayesian conditionalisation or similar procedures. A Bayesian epistemologist would use probability to define, and explore the relationship between, concepts such as epistemic status, support or explanatory power.\"\n\nLet the set formula_21 of terms be:\n\nformula_22\n\nThen, the set formula_23 of documents is as follows:\n\nwhere formula_25\n\nLet the query formula_4 be:\n\nformula_27Then to retrieve the relevant documents:\nThis means that the original document formula_19 (corresponding to formula_36) is the answer to formula_4.\n\nObviously, if there is more than one document with the same representation, every such document is retrieved. Such documents are indistinguishable in the BIR (in other words, equivalent).\n\n\n\nFrom a pure formal mathematical point of view, the BIR is straightforward. From a practical point of view, however, several further problems should be solved that relate to algorithms and data structures, such as, for example, the choice of terms (manual or automatic selection or both), stemming, hash tables, inverted file structure, and so on.\n\nAnother possibility is to use hash sets. Each document is represented by a hash table which contains every single term of that document. Since hash table size increases and decreases in real time with the addition and removal of terms, each document will occupy much less space in memory. However, it will have a slowdown in performance because the operations are more complex than with bit vectors. On the worst-case performance can degrade from O(\"n\") to O(\"n\"). On the average case, the performance slowdown will not be that much worse than bit vectors and the space usage is much more efficient.\n"}

{"id": "54385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54385", "title": "Child sacrifice", "text": "Child sacrifice\n\nChild sacrifice is the ritualistic killing of children in order to please or appease a god or supernatural beings in order to achieve a desired result. As such, it is a form of human sacrifice. The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in criticism of religion.\nChild sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is.\n\nArcheologists have found remains of 42 children. It is alleged that these remains were sacrificed to Tlaloc (and a few to Ehécatl, Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli) in the offerings of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan by the Aztecs of pre-Columbian Mexico. Human sacrifice was an everyday activity in Tenochtitlan and children were not exempt. They, in particular, were offered to Tláloc, the god of rain. Bernardino de Sahagún, a religious man left writings that describe such sacrifices, compiled from the first-hand accounts of natives who had lived in Tenochtitlan in the times before it fell. Hernán Cortés himself also mentioned child sacrifices in his letters to King Carlos I of Spain.\n\nThe Inca culture sacrificed children in a ritual called \"qhapaq hucha\". Their frozen corpses have been discovered in the South American mountaintops. The first of these corpses, a female child who had died from a blow to the skull, was discovered in 1995 by Johan Reinhard. Other methods of sacrifice included strangulation and simply leaving the children, who had been given an intoxicating drink, to lose consciousness in the extreme cold and low-oxygen conditions of the mountaintop, and to die of hypothermia.\n\nIn Maya culture, people believed that supernatural beings had power over their lives and this is one reason that child sacrifice occurred. The sacrifices were essentially to satisfy the supernatural beings. This was done through \"k'ex\", which is an exchange or substitution of something. Through \"k’ex\" infants would substitute more powerful humans. It was thought that supernatural beings would consume the souls of more powerful humans and infants were substituted in order to prevent that. Infants are believed to be good offerings because they have a close connection to the spirit world through liminality. It is also believed that parents in Maya culture would offer their children for sacrifice and depictions of this show that this was a very emotional time for the parents, but they would carry through because they thought the child would continue existing. It is also known that infant sacrifices occurred at certain times. Child sacrifice was preferred when there was a time of crisis and transitional times such as famine and drought.\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of infant sacrifice in tombs where the infant has been buried in urns or ceramic vessels. There have also been depictions of child sacrifice in art. Some art includes pottery and steles as well as references to infant sacrifice in mythology and art depictions of the mythology.\n\nThe Moche of northern Peru practiced mass sacrifices of men and boys.\n\nThe Timoto-Cuicas offered human sacrifices. Until colonial times children sacrifice persisted secretly in Laguna de Urao (Mérida). It were described by the chronicler Juan de Castellanos, who cited that feasts and human sacrifices were done in honour of Icaque, an Andean prehispanic goddess.\n\nReferences in the Tanakh point to an awareness of human sacrifice in the history of ancient Near Eastern practice. The king of Moab gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (\"olah\", as used of the Temple sacrifice). In the book of the prophet Micah, the question is asked, 'Shall I give my firstborn for my sin, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?', and responded to in the phrase, 'He has shown all you people what is good. And what does Yahweh require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.' The Tanakh also implies that the Ammonites offered child sacrifices to Moloch.\n\nIn Leviticus 18:21, 20:3 and Deuteronomy 12:30-31, 18:10, the Torah contains a number of imprecations against and laws forbidding child sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The Tanakh denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of Baal worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37).\nJames Kugel argues that the Torah's specifically forbidding child sacrifice indicates that it happened in Israel as well. Mark S. Smith argues that the mention of \"Topeth\" in Isaiah 30:27–33 indicates an acceptance of child sacrifice in the early Jerusalem practices, to which the law in Leviticus 20:2–5 forbidding child sacrifice is a response. Some scholars have stated that at least some Israelites and Judahites believed child sacrifice was a legitimate religious practice.\n\nGenesis relates the binding of Isaac, him to present his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah. No reason is given within the text. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an angel stopping Abraham at the last minute and making Isaac's sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. Francesca Stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story \"contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac\". Rabbi A.I. Kook, first Chief Rabbi of Israel, stressed that the climax of the story, commanding Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac, is the whole point: to put an end to the ritual of child sacrifice, which contradicts the morality of a perfect and giving (not taking) monotheistic God. According to Irving Greenberg the story of the binding of Isaac, symbolizes the prohibition to worship God by human sacrifices, at a time when human sacrifices were the norm worldwide.\n\nThe most extensive accounts of child sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible refer to those carried out in Gehenna by two kings of Judah, Ahaz and Manasseh.\n\nIn the Book of Judges, the figure of Jephthah makes a vow to God, saying, \"If you give the Ammonites into my hands, whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering\" (as worded in the New International Version). Jephthah succeeds in winning a victory, but when he returns to his home in Mizpah he sees his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels, outside. After allowing her two months preparation, Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah kept his vow. According to the commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord. The 1st-century CE Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, however, understood this to mean that Jephthah burned his daughter on Yahweh's altar, whilst pseudo-Philo, late first century CE, wrote that Jephthah offered his daughter as a burnt offering because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow. In other words, this story of human sacrifice is not an order or requirement by God, but the punishment for those who vowed to sacrifice humans.\n\nNeighbors criticized Carthage for their child sacrifice practices. Plutarch (ca. 46–120 AD), Tertullian, Orosius, and Diodorus Siculus mention this practice; however, Livy and Polybius do not. The ancestors of Carthage, Canaanites, were also mentioned performing child sacrifices in the Hebrew Bible and by some Israelites, at a place called the Tophet (\"roasting place\").\n\nSome of these sources suggest that babies were roasted to death on a heated bronze statue. According to Diodorus Siculus, \"There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire.\"(Bib. Hist. 20.14.6)\n\nSites within Carthage and other Phoenician centers revealed the remains of young children in large numbers; some historians interpret this as evidence for frequent and prominent child sacrifice to the god Baal-hamon.\n\nThe accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists. At Carthage a large cemetery exists that combines the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who assert child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed, then so too were the children. Recent archaeology however, has produced a detailed breakdown of the ages of the buried children and, based on this and especially on the presence of prenatal individuals – that is, still births – it is also argued that this site is consistent with burials of children who had died of natural causes in a society that had a high infant mortality rate, as Carthage is assumed to have had. That is, the data support the view that Tophets were cemeteries for those who died shortly before or after birth, regardless of the cause of death.\n\nGreek, Roman and Israelite writers refer to Phoenician child sacrifice. However, some historians have disputed this interpretation, suggesting instead that these were resting places for children miscarried or who died in infancy. Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was \"a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were \"offered\" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead\". The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.\n\nAccording to Stager and Wolff, in 1984, there was a consensus among scholars that Carthaginian children were sacrificed by their parents, who would make a vow to kill the next child if the gods would grant them a favor: for instance that their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port. They placed their children alive in the arms of a bronze statue of:\n\nLater commentators have compared the accounts of child sacrifice in the Old Testament with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the Punic city of Carthage, which was a Phoenician colony. Cleitarchus in his \"Scholia\" of Plato's Republic mentions the practice:\n\nThis reference also seems to clarify that the statue itself was not made to move by the flames, but rather the burnt and shriveled body of the victim was contorted by them.\n\nDiodorus Siculus too references this practice:\n\nPlutarch in \"De superstitione\" also mentions the practice in Carthage:\nThese all mention the burning of children as offerings to Cronus or Saturn, that is to Ba'al Hammon, the chief god of Carthage (see Interpretatio Graeca and Interpretatio Romana for clarification).\n\nClaims concerning Moloch and child sacrifice may have been made for negative-propaganda effect. The Romans and Israelites describe child sacrifice as a practice of their \"evil\" enemies. Some scholars think that, after the Romans finally defeated Carthage and totally destroyed the city, they engaged in postwar propaganda to make their arch-enemies seem cruel and less civilized. The question of whether Phoenician child sacrifice was real or a myth continues to be discussed in academic circles, including the work of M'hamed Hassine Fantar.\nThe Quran documents pagan Arabians sacrificing their children to idols.\n\nThe Minoan civilization, located in ancient Crete, is widely accepted as the first civilization in Europe. An expedition to Knossos by the British School of Athens, led by Peter Warren, excavated a mass grave of sacrifices, particularly children, and unearthed evidence of cannibalism.\n\nAdditionally, Rodney Castleden uncovered a sanctuary near Knossos where the remains of a 17-year-old were found sacrificed.\n\nAt Woodhenge, a young child was found buried with its skull split by a weapon. This has been interpreted by the excavators as a child sacrifice, as have other human remains.\n\nThe Ver Sacrum (\"A Sacred Spring\") was a custom by which a Greco-Roman city would devote and sacrifice everything born in the spring, whether animal or human, to a god, in order to relieve some calamity.\n\nThe murder of children for body parts with which to make muti, for purposes of witchcraft, still occurs in South Africa. Muti murders occur throughout South Africa, especially in rural areas. Traditional healers or witch doctors often grind up body parts and combine them with roots, herbs, seawater, animal parts, and other ingredients to prepare potions and spells for their clients.\n\nIn the early 21st century Uganda has experienced a revival of child sacrifice. In spite of government attempts to downplay the issue, an investigation by the BBC into human sacrifice in Uganda found that ritual killings of children are more common than Ugandan authorities admit. There are many indicators that politicians and politically connected wealthy businessmen are involved in sacrificing children in practice of traditional religion, which has become a commercial enterprise.\n\n\n"}

Readers of blog posts on the site were able to post public or private comments to the blog authors directly on the page. The history of comment sections on news articles started in 1998 with \"The Rocky Mountain News\", they were one of the first newspapers to add online same page comments. \n\nWhile today comment sections are common, at first newspapers were hesitant to add them. In the late 2000s Comments sections were rapidly added to news sites, between 2007 and 2008 there was a 42% growth in the number of top circulating news sites with comments sections. In 2008 75% of the top 100 most circulated newspapers had comments sections. In 2010 \"The American Journalism Review\" stated that news sites should not have anonymous comments sections. Following that statement \"Reuters, ESPN, The Huffington Post, Popular Science, Sporting News, and USA Today\" either made comments gated or removed them.\n\nThe following are examples of some news websites that have disabled comments:\n\n\nThere are two types of comment sections, gated and non-gated. Gated comments sections require users to give the website some information before they can post a comment. Many news websites such as \"The New York Times\" and most social media websites are gated, as users have to log in and post under a username that identifies them. \n\nNon-gated comment sections don’t require users to provide information before posting. This lack of a barrier to entry can allow more people to post and potentially lead to a discussion with more viewpoints covered. This anonymity, however, is believed by some to lead to uncivil behavior and a higher likelihood of seeing or experiencing verbal aggression in the comments. In response to this, both the Illinois and New York State senates have considered bills to limit non-gated comment sections. The Illinois bill would have incentivized websites to gate their comments requiring users to provide their real name, a home address and a confirmed IP address. The New York Bill would have made websites remove anonymous commenting.\n\nToxic comments refer to rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comments that are likely to make one leave a discussion. \n\nIf a comment section is moderated it is typically done in any one of the three ways: post-moderation, pre-moderation, or through a flagging system. Comments that are post-moderated are checked after they’ve been posted. Pre-moderated comments are checked before they are made publicly visible. Comments that are moderated with a flagging system can be marked or ‘flagged’ by other users for official website moderators to look at. \n\nIn February 2017, Google-founded technology incubator Jigsaw unveiled a tool based on artificial intelligence, called Perspective API, to identify toxic comments in online forums.\n\nIn September 2017, Disqus, a company that provides a comment-hosting services, analysed over 92 million comments written by 2 million people over 16 months, on about 7,000 forums that used its service, and concluded that 25% of all commenters made at least one toxic comment. The study was carried out using Google's Perspective API. In the United States, the time of the day at which maximum proportion of comments were toxic, was 3 am. However, \"Engadget\" denounced the underlying API bringing attention to its discriminatory classifications - phrases like \"I am a gay black woman\" were scored as 87% toxic. It described the algorithm as \"sexist, racist and ableist\". \n\nGood moderation of news websites is expensive. However, most news sites do moderate. Studies of newspaper website and blog comments have shown incivility to be present in as many as 25% of comments.\n\n"}
{"id": "167001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167001", "title": "Concrete category", "text": "Concrete category\n\nIn mathematics, a concrete category is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to the category of sets (or sometimes to another category, \"see Relative concreteness below\"). This functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of its morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of topological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets.\n\nA concrete category, when defined without reference to the notion of a category, consists of a class of \"objects\", each equipped with an \"underlying set\"; and for any two objects \"A\" and \"B\" a set of functions, called \"morphisms\", from the underlying set of \"A\" to the underlying set of \"B\". Furthermore, for every object \"A\", the identity function on the underlying set of \"A\" must be a morphism from \"A\" to \"A\", and the composition of a morphism from \"A\" to \"B\" followed by a morphism from \"B\" to \"C\" must be a morphism from \"A\" to \"C\".\n\nA concrete category is a pair (\"C\",\"U\") such that\n\n\nThe functor \"U\" is to be thought of as a forgetful functor, which assigns to every object of \"C\" its \"underlying set\", and to every morphism in \"C\" its \"underlying function\".\n\nA category \"C\" is concretizable if there exists a concrete category (\"C\",\"U\");\ni.e., if there exists a faithful functor \"U\":\"C\" → Set. All small categories are concretizable: define \"U\" so that its object part maps each object \"b\" of \"C\" to the set of all morphisms of \"C\" whose codomain is \"b\" (i.e. all morphisms of the form \"f\": \"a\" → \"b\" for any object \"a\" of \"C\"), and its morphism part maps each morphism \"g\": \"b\" → \"c\" of \"C\" to the function \"U\"(\"g\"): \"U\"(\"b\") → \"U\"(\"c\") which maps each member \"f\": \"a\" → \"b\" of \"U\"(\"b\") to the composition \"gf\": \"a\" → \"c\", a member of \"U\"(\"c\"). (Item 6 under Further examples expresses the same \"U\" in less elementary language via presheaves.) The Counter-examples section exhibits two large categories that are not concretizable.\n\nIt is important to note that, contrary to intuition, concreteness is not a property which a category may or may not satisfy, but rather a structure with which a category may or may not be equipped. In particular, a category \"C\" may admit several faithful functors into Set. Hence there may be several concrete categories (\"C\",\"U\") all corresponding to the same category \"C\".\n\nIn practice, however, the choice of faithful functor is often clear and in this case we simply speak of the \"concrete category \"C\"\". For example, \"the concrete category Set\" means the pair (Set,\"I\") where \"I\" denotes the identity functor Set → Set.\n\nThe requirement that \"U\" be faithful means that it maps different morphisms between the same objects to different functions. However, \"U\" may map different objects to the same set and, if this occurs, it will also map different morphisms to the same function.\n\nFor example, if \"S\" and \"T\" are two different topologies on the same set \"X\", then \n(\"X\",\"S\") and (\"X\",\"T\") are distinct objects in the category Top of topological spaces and continuous maps, but mapped to the same set \"X\" by the forgetful functor Top → Set. Moreover, the identity morphism (\"X\",\"S\") → (\"X\",\"S\") and the identity morphism (\"X\",\"T\") → (\"X\",\"T\") are considered distinct morphisms in Top, but they have the same underlying function, namely the identity function on \"X\".\n\nSimilarly, any set with 4 elements can be given two non-isomorphic group structures: one isomorphic to formula_1; the other isomorphic to formula_2.\n\n\nThe category hTop, where the objects are topological spaces and the morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous functions, is an example of a category that is not concretizable. \nWhile the objects are sets (with additional structure), the morphisms are not actual functions between them, but rather classes of functions. \nThe fact that there does not exist \"any\" faithful functor from hTop to Set was first proven by Peter Freyd. \nIn the same article, Freyd cites an earlier result that the category of \"small categories and natural equivalence-classes of functors\" also fails to be concretizable.\n\nGiven a concrete category (\"C\",\"U\") and a cardinal number \"N\", let \"U\" be the functor \"C\" → Set determined by \"U(c) = (U(c))\". \nThen a subfunctor of \"U\" is called an \"N-ary predicate\" and a \nnatural transformation \"U\" → \"U\" an \"N-ary operation\".\n\nThe class of all \"N\"-ary predicates and \"N\"-ary operations of a concrete category (\"C\",\"U\"), with \"N\" ranging over the class of all cardinal numbers, forms a large signature. The category of models for this signature then contains a full subcategory which is equivalent to \"C\".\n\nIn some parts of category theory, most notably topos theory, it is common to replace the category Set with a different category \"X\", often called a \"base category\". \nFor this reason, it makes sense to call a pair (\"C\",\"U\") where \"C\" is a category and \"U\" a faithful functor \"C\" → \"X\" a concrete category over \"X\".\nFor example, it may be useful to think of the models of a theory with \"N\" sorts as forming a concrete category over Set.\n\nIn this context, a concrete category over Set is sometimes called a \"construct\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1423677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1423677", "title": "Conflict escalation", "text": "Conflict escalation\n\nConflict escalation is the process by which conflicts grow in severity over time. This may refer to conflicts between individuals or groups in interpersonal relationships, or it may refer to the escalation of hostilities in a political or military context. In systems theory, the process of conflict escalation is modeled by positive feedback.\n\nWhile the word \"escalation\" was used as early as in 1938, it was popularized during the Cold War by two important books: \"On Escalation\" (Herman Kahn, 1965) and \"Escalation and the Nuclear Option\" (Bernard Brodie, 1966). In these contexts, it especially referred to war between two states with weapons of mass destruction—the Cold War.\n\nConflict escalation has a tactical role in military conflict, and is often formalized with explicit rules of engagement. Highly successful military tactics exploit a particular form of conflict escalation; for example, controlling an opponent's reaction time allows the tactician to pursue or trap his opponent. Napoleon and Heinz Guderian both advocated this approach. Sun Tzu elaborated it in a more abstract form, and additionally maintained that military strategy was about minimizing escalation, and diplomacy about eliminating it.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps' \"Continuum of Force\" (found in MCRP 3-02B) documents the stages of conflict escalation in combat for a typical subject. They are:\n\nThe subject responds to and obeys verbal commands. He refrains from close combat.\n\nThe subject resists verbal commands but complies to commands immediately upon contact controls. He refrains from close combat.\n\nInitially, the subject physically resists commands, but he can be made to comply by compliance techniques; these include come-along holds, soft-handed stunning blows, and techniques inducing pain by joint manipulation and pressure points.\n\nThe unarmed subject physically attacks his opponent. He can be controlled by certain defensive tactics, including blocks, strikes, kicks, enhanced pain compliance procedures, impact weapon blocks and blows.\n\nThe subject has a weapon and will likely kill or injure someone unless controlled. This is only possible by lethal force, which possibly requires firearms or weapons.\n\nA major focus of peace and conflict theory is concerned with curbing conflict escalation or creating a mindset to avoid such conflict in future, and instead engaging in peacemaking. Much nonviolent conflict resolution, however, involves conflict escalation in the form of protests, strikes, or other direct actions.\n\nMohandas Gandhi, a major proponent of nonviolence, used satyagraha to demonstrate that:\n\nWith this method of escalation, Gandhi avoided technological escalation and demonstrated to those in power that:\n\nThe conflict escalation curve is a concept created by Michael N. Nagler. The conflict escalation curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict is directly related to how far dehumanization has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).\n\nThe curve conceptualizes a typical trajectory a conflict would have if it were plotted on an (x,y) graph with (x) being time elapsed and (y) being the intensity of dehumanization. Depending upon which stage a conflict is on the graph, a specific set of responses is needed.\nThe curve divides the appropriate responses into three stages.\n\nIn the first stage no serious dehumanization has occurred by either party. Attempts are made mainly to make one's views known, with the expectation that the other may respond right away or respond to conflict resolution or nonviolent communication to address the adversary. Tools used at this stage include: petitions, protest demonstrations, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration.\n\nThe conflict escalates into satyagraha, or nonviolent direct action, only when conflict resolution has been tried and the other party has not been persuaded by reason or the other tools used in Stage 1. Satyagraha invokes what Gandhi called \"the law of suffering\"—taking on rather than inflicting the suffering that is inherent in the situation.\n\nInvoking satyagraha is a way to move the heart of the adversary, as opposed to appealing merely to the head, in Stage 1. Gandhi observed: \"The conviction has been growing upon me that things of fundamental importance to the people are not secured by reason alone, but have to be purchased with their suffering. If you want something really important to be done, you must not merely satisfy the reason, you must move the heart also. The penetration of the heart comes from suffering.\" Tools used at this stage include: strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, defiance of orders.\n\nWhen the conflict has reached life-or-death intensity and when petition and nonviolent resistance have failed, a satyagrahi will sometimes deliberately court the possibility of death as a last resort to open the heart of the opponent. Gandhi's famous \"fasts unto death\" during the Indian freedom struggle is an example, as well as the courageous work of activists like Kathy Kelly who, when all else failed, have repeatedly gone into war zones to share the fate of the victims and awaken their oppressors.\n\nThe philosophy behind Stage 3 is that being willing to risk dying can often awaken a stubborn adversary even if death does not ensue. Fasting unto death, for example, when contrasted with self-immolation, gives the opponent a chance to respond and save the life of the satyagrahi in question. Self-immolation should perhaps be considered an extreme form of protest rather than the final stage in nonviolent persuasion.\n\nThe conflict escalation curve helps those in a movement have a sense of where they are in their conflict and what is an appropriate response; it would be wrong to reach for an extreme method like fasting (which is Stage 3: Sacrifice) in a situation when all available tools in Stage 1 or 2 have not been tried.\n\nFor example, in 2003, US President George W. Bush dismissed the global anti-Iraq protests, the largest such protests since the Vietnam War, as \"a focus group,\" saying: \"Size of protest—it's like deciding, well, I'm going to decide policy based upon a focus group.\" The President's lack of acknowledgement of protesters' demands as well as his unwillingness to engage in negotiations were an indication that it was necessary for the movement to quickly move to Stage 2 if they were to get any response. This was not forthcoming.\n\nCarol Moore, a later theorist, examined and described Gandhi's methods from the perspective of systems theory. Jay Forrester and Donella Meadows observed that people in crisis would often push the twelve leverage points towards escalation in the first stage, and then reduce escalation when the resistance had weakened and it was impossible to maintain the status quo.\n\n"}

For example, in time series analysis, a correlogram, also known as an autocorrelation plot, is a plot of the sample autocorrelations formula_1 versus formula_2 (the time lags).\n\nIf cross-correlation is used, the result is called a \"cross-correlogram\". The correlogram is a commonly used tool for checking randomness in a data set. This randomness is ascertained by computing autocorrelations for data values at varying time lags. If random, such autocorrelations should be near zero for any and all time-lag separations. If non-random, then one or more of the autocorrelations will be significantly non-zero.\n\nIn addition, correlograms are used in the model identification stage for Box–Jenkins autoregressive moving average time series models. Autocorrelations should be near-zero for randomness; if the analyst does not check for randomness, then the validity of many of the statistical conclusions becomes suspect. The correlogram is an excellent way of checking for such randomness.\n\nSometimes, corrgrams, color-mapped matrices of correlation strengths in multivariate analysis, are also called correlograms.\n\nThe correlogram can help provide answers to the following questions:\n\nRandomness (along with fixed model, fixed variation, and fixed distribution) is one of the four assumptions that typically underlie all measurement processes. The randomness assumption is critically important for the following three reasons:\nwhere \"s\" is the standard deviation of the data. Although heavily used, the results from using this formula are of no value unless the randomness assumption holds.\nIf the data are not random, this model is incorrect and invalid, and the estimates for the parameters (such as the constant) become nonsensical and invalid.\n\nThe autocorrelation coefficient at lag \"h\" is given by\nwhere \"c\" is the autocovariance function\nand \"c\" is the variance function\n\nThe resulting value of \"r\" will range between −1 and +1.\n\nSome sources may use the following formula for the autocovariance function:\nAlthough this definition has less bias, the (1/\"N\") formulation has some desirable statistical properties and is the form most commonly used in the statistics literature. See pages 20 and 49–50 in Chatfield for details.\n\nIn the same graph one can draw upper and lower bounds for autocorrelation with significance level formula_11:\n\nIf the autocorrelation is higher (lower) than this upper (lower) bound, the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation at and beyond a given lag is rejected at a significance level of formula_11. This test is an approximate one and assumes that the time-series is Gaussian.\n\nIn the above, \"z\" is the quantile of the normal distribution; SE is the standard error, which can be computed by Bartlett's formula for MA(\"ℓ\") processes:\n\nIn the picture above we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation between time-points which are adjacent (lag = 1). For the other periods one cannot reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.\n\nNote that there are two distinct formulas for generating the confidence bands:\n\n1. If the correlogram is being used to test for randomness (i.e., there is no time dependence in the data), the following formula is recommended:\nwhere \"N\" is the sample size, \"z\" is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution and α is the significance level. In this case, the confidence bands have fixed width that depends on the sample size.\n\n2. Correlograms are also used in the model identification stage for fitting ARIMA models. In this case, a moving average model is assumed for the data and the following confidence bands should be generated:\nwhere \"k\" is the lag. In this case, the confidence bands increase as the lag increases.\n\nCorrelograms are available in most general purpose statistical software programs. In R, the function acf and pacf can be used to produce such a plot.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15632220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15632220", "title": "Crime and violence in Latin America", "text": "Crime and violence in Latin America\n\nCrime and violence affect the lives of millions of people in Latin America. Some consider social inequality to be a major contributing factor to levels of violence in Latin America, where the state fails to prevent crime and organized crime takes over State control in areas where the State is unable to assist the society such as in impoverished communities. In the years following the transitions from authoritarianism to democracy, crime and violence have become major problems in Latin America.\n\nSeveral studies indicated the existence of an epidemic in the region; the Pan American Health Organization called violence in Latin America \"the social pandemic of the 20th century.\" Apart from the direct human cost, the rise in crime and violence has imposed significant social costs and has made much more difficult the processes of economic and social development, democratic consolidation and regional integration in the Americas.\n\nHigh rates of crime and violence in Latin America are undermining growth, threatening human welfare, and impeding social development, according to World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\nLatin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime. Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.\n\nRecent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America. Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.\n\nIn Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in Brazil. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of Rio de Janeiro, armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in El Salvador, Guatemala and Venezuela during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries. There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America. The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is San Pedro Sula in Honduras, leading various media sources to label it the \"murder capital of the world.\" Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.\n\nCrime is slowing economic growth and undermining democratic consolidation in Latin America. Today, Latin America has the dubious distinction of being most violent region in the world, with combined crime rates more than triple the world average and are comparable to rates in nations experiencing war. This is taking a tremendous toll on development in the region by both affecting economic growth and public faith in democracy.\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank estimates that Latin America's per capita Gross Domestic Product would be twenty-five percent higher if the region's crime rates were equal to the world average. Similarly, the World Bank has identified a strong correlation between crime and income inequality. Business associations in the region rank crime as the number one issue negatively affecting trade and investment. Crime-related violence also represents the most important threat to public health, striking more victims than HIV/AIDS or other infectious diseases.\nPublic faith in democracy itself is under threat as governments are perceived as unable to deliver basic services such as public security. A United Nations report revealed that only 43 percent of Latin Americans are fully supportive of democracy. Crime has rapidly risen to the top of the list of citizen concerns in Latin America. As the Economist magazine described it, \"in several Latin American countries, 2004 will be remembered as the year in which the people rose up in revolt against crime.\"\n\nMassive street marches such as those that took place in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, and other expressions of protest against violence, have made it increasingly difficult for politicians to avoid dealing with the issue and, in many countries, have made tackling crime a central theme in political party platforms across the region. Several leaders in the region, including El Salvador's Tony Saca, Ricardo Maduro in Honduras, Guatemala's Óscar Berger, and Álvaro Uribe in Colombia, have all campaigned on a strong anti-crime message. The Presidents of Honduras and El Salvador have called gangs \"(maras)\" as big a threat to national security in their countries as terrorism is to the United States.\n\n\"World Bank researchers have demonstrated the existence of a 'criminal inertia,' in which high rates of criminality endure long after the latent socioeconomic causes have disappeared or been addressed through policy interventions.\"\n\nAnother reason critics believe fuels crime in Latin America is due to the poor public primary education system they say it \"has given rise to youths without jobs or expectations of employment-thereby fueling the mounting problem of gang violence in Central America, Mexico, Jamaica, Trinidad, Colombia and Brazil.\" \n\nA series of factors have contributed to the increase in violent crime in Latin America since the transitions from authoritarianism to democracy. Some intrinsic factors and characteristics of each country aggravated the problem in some countries. However, some factors might have increased the risk of crime and violence in many or most countries in the region in the period between the 1980s and 1990s:\n\n\nBrazil is one of the countries that has the largest inequality in terms of the gap between the very wealthy and the extremely destitute. A huge portion of the population lives in poverty. According to the World Bank, \"one-fifth of Brazil's 173 million people account for only a 2.2 percent share of the national income. Brazil is second only to South Africa in a world ranking of income inequality.\n\nThe incidence of violent crime, including muggings, armed robbery, murder and sexual assault is high, particularly in Rio de Janeiro, Recife and other large cities. Carjacking is also common, particularly in major cities. Criminals often use guns. Gang-related violence is common throughout the State of São Paulo. Crime levels in slum areas are very high. Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators. During peak tourist seasons, large, organised criminal gangs have reportedly robbed and assaulted beach goers. The country is well known for having almost 60,000 documented murders every year for the past decade, mostly drug and robbery related.\n\n'Express kidnappings', where individuals are abducted and forced to withdraw funds from automated teller machines to secure their release, are common in major cities including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Brasília, Salvador and Recife. People have been robbed and assaulted when using unregistered taxis. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Thieves operate in outdoor markets, in hotels and on public transport. Piracy occurs in the coastal areas of Brazil.\n\nElements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug-trafficking. In a country where the presence of the state has always been weak, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in the crossfire and often deliberately targeted for \"collaborating\". Human rights advocates blame paramilitaries for massacres, \"disappearances\", and cases of torture and forced displacement. Rebel groups such as the FARC and the ELN are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion. The level of drug related violence was halved in the last 10 years, when the country moved from being the most violent country in the world to have a homicide rate that is inferior to the one registered in countries like Honduras, Jamaica, El Salvador, Venezuela, Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago and South Africa.\n\nThe administration of President Uribe has sought to professionalize the armed forces and to engage them more fully in the counterinsurgency war; as a result, the armed groups have suffered a series of setbacks. Police in Colombia say the number of people kidnapped has fallen 92% since 2000. Common criminals are now the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of kidnappings. By the year 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline. In general, and you are much more likely to encounter a Colombian army checkpoint than an illegal guerrilla roadblock.\n\nColombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC.\n\nViolent crime is rampant in El Salvador, in 2015 the homicide rate peaked at 105 homicides per 100,000 residents. In 2016, the rate decreased by 20%, but El Salvador continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. As of March 2012, El Salvador has seen a 40% drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce. In early 2012, there were on average of 16 killings per day but in late March that number dropped to fewer than 5 per day and on April 14, 2012 for the first time in over 3 years there were no killings in the country. Overall, there were 411 killings in the month of January 2012 but in March the number was 188, more than a 40% reduction in crime. All of this happening while crime in neighboring Honduras has risen to an all-time high.\n\nViolent crime including armed robbery, banditry, assault, kidnapping, sexual assault, and carjacking is common, including in the capital, San Salvador. Downtown San Salvador is dangerous, particularly at night. Public safety is no laughing matter, San Salvador hosts one of the most notorious unified crime family transnational gangs that spread across the Central American heart region, like the Mara Salvatrucha and the 18th Street gang that arrived during and since the Salvadoran Civil War.\n\nThe security situation has taken a downturn in San Salvador; in 2002, there were over 9000 intentional homicides in the city of San Salvador by international global Central American Gangs or Maras. 2005 and 2006 saw a worsening security situation in San Salvador; and corruption, with the trend continuing in 2008. Crimes have increased to 13 daily, with this sharp increase having occurred in the last six years, making the words San Salvador City synonymous with crime. The portrayal of San Salvador was a dark and foreboding metropolis rife and reign with crime, grime, corruption, and a deep-seated sense of urban decay, ultimately a vice city.\n\nAfter the civil war and left in complete ruins and destruction, people described and called the city \"San Salvador La Ciudad Que Se Desmorona\", \"San Salvador The City That Crumbles\". San Salvador is a rampant and recurring corruption within the city's civil authorities and infrastructure. Certain locations disputed by rival gangs especially in poor slums on the outskirts areas of San Salvador City are labeled as No man's land.\n\nHigh-level corruption in El Salvador is a serious problem. President Mauricio Funes pledged to investigate and prosecute corrupt senior officials when he took office in June, 2009, but after a political truce with his predecessor, Antonio Saca, who was expelled from the ARENA party amid large-scale corruption allegations, Funes showed an unwillingness to tackle the problem. ARENA alleged that $219 million in government funds under Saca's personal control had disappeared. Saca's own former political allies in the ARENA party and private sector told the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador of widespread abuse of power for personal financial gain. Such corruption, the U.S. Embassy reported in a cable leaked by WikiLeaks, \"went beyond the pale\" even by Salvadoran standards.\n\nCrime is a major problem in Honduras, which has the highest murder rate of any nation. There are reports that after the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, there was a large increase in crime and violence. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Honduras has the highest rate of intentional homicide in the world, with 6,239 intentional homicides, or 82.1 per 100,000 of population in 2010. This is significantly higher than the rate in El Salvador, which at 66.0 per 100,000 in 2010, has the second highest rate of intentional homicide in the world.\n\nAccording to the International Crisis Group, the most violent regions outside of the major urban areas in Honduras exist on the border with Guatemala, and are highly correlated with the many active drug trafficking routes plying the region.\n\nCrime is among the most urgent concerns facing Mexico, as Mexican drug trafficking rings play a major role in the flow of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana transiting between Latin America and the United States. Drug trafficking has contributed to corruption, which has had a deleterious effect on Mexico's Federal Representative Republic. Drug trafficking and organized crime have also been a major source of violent crime in Mexico.\n\nMexico has experienced increasingly high crime rates, especially in major urban centers. The country's great economic polarization has stimulated criminal activity in the lower socioeconomic strata, which include the majority of the country's population. Crime continues at high levels, and is repeatedly marked by violence, especially in the cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, and the states of Baja California, Durango, Sinaloa, Guerrero, Chihuahua, Michoacán, Tamaulipas, and Nuevo León. Other metropolitan areas have lower, yet still serious, levels of crime. Low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to the high crime rate.\n\nBefore the drug war in Mexico, there were roughly 300 murders in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in 2007. In 2010, state officials reported a peak of 3,622 homicides in the city. With a rate of 272 murders per 100,000 residents, Ciudad Juarez alone had the highest murder rate in the world, although the rate has steadily decreased since then to reach only 300 murders in 2015.\n\nPuerto Rico has become a major transshipment point for illegal drugs that are smuggled from source countries like Colombia and Peru into the U.S. mainland. Most of it is transported to and through the island from drug trafficking organizations in the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Florida, and criminal organizations in Puerto Rico. One of the most common ways drugs are smuggled into the island is through commercial and private maritime vessels, and container terminals such as the Port of San Juan. It is the busiest port in the Caribbean and the second busiest in Latin America.\n\nBecause drugs are trafficked directly into the island from other source countries, they are less expensive than in any other place in the United States. Thus, it is cheap and easy for street gangs to buy and deal to the public mostly in, and from, housing projects, leading to turf wars and the second highest homicide rate in the United States. Police undermining in the drug trade and corruption are also common. Between 1993 and 2000, 1,000 police officers in Puerto Rico lost their jobs from the department due to criminal charges and between 2003 and 2007, 75 officers were convicted under federal court for police corruption. 2011 was marked as the most violent year for Puerto Rico with approximately 1,120 murders recorded, 30.5 homicides per 100,000 residents.\n\nVenezuela is among the most violent places in Latin America. Class tension has long been a part of life in the South American country, where armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are frequent. Venezuela was ranked the most insecure nation in the world by \"Gallup\" in 2013 with the United Nations stating that such crime is due to the poor political and economic environment in the country. As a result of the high levels of crime, Venezuelans were forced to change their ways of life due to the large insecurities they continuously experienced.\n\nCrime rates are higher in 'barrios' or 'ranchos' (slum areas) after dark. Petty crime such as pick-pocketing is prevalent, particularly on public transport in Caracas. The government in 2009 created a security force, the Bolivarian National Police, which has supposedly lowered crime rates in the areas in which it is so far deployed according to the Venezuelan government, and a new Experimental Security University was created. However, many statistics have shown an increase of crime even after such measures were taken, with the 2014 murder rate showing an increase to 82 per 100,000, more than quadrupling since 1998. The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents. Venezuela has also ranked high internationally among countries with high kidnapping rates, with consulting firm Control Risk ranking Venezuela 5th in the world for kidnappings in 2013 and News.com.au calling Venezuela's capital city of Caracas \"the kidnap capital of the world\" in 2013, noting that Venezuela had the highest kidnapping rate in the world and that 5 people were kidnapped for a ransom every day.\n\nForeign governments have also advised tourists of safety concerns while visiting the country. The United States State Department and Government of Canada has warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to robbery, kidnapping for a ransom or sale to terrorist organizations and murder, and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in armored vehicles. The United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised against all travel to Venezuela.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6524349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6524349", "title": "Debt-for-nature swap", "text": "Debt-for-nature swap\n\nDebt-for-nature swaps are financial transactions in which a portion of a developing nation's foreign debt is forgiven in exchange for local investments in environmental conservation measures.\n\nThe debt-for-nature swaps concept was first conceived by Thomas Lovejoy of the World Wildlife Fund in 1984 as an opportunity to deal with the problems of developing-nation indebtedness and its consequent deleterious effect on the environment. In the wake of the Latin American debt crisis that resulted in steep reductions to the environmental conservation ability of highly indebted nations, Lovejoy suggested that ameliorating debt promoting conservation could be done at the same time. Since the first swap occurred between Conservation International and Bolivia in 1987, many national governments and conservation organizations have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps. Most swaps occur in tropical countries, which contain many diverse species of flora and fauna. Also, countries that have engaged in debt-for-nature swaps typically have several threatened or endangered species, experience rapid deforestation, and have relatively stable, often democratic, political systems. Since 1987, debt-for-nature agreements have generated over US$1 billion for conservation in developing countries.\n\nThe financing mechanism for debt-for-nature swaps is an agreement among the funder(s), the national government of the debtor country, and the conservation organization(s) using the funds. The national government of the indebted country agrees to a payment schedule on the amount of the debt forgiven, usually paid through the nation’s central bank, in local currency or bonds. The process is shown in Figure 1.\nParticipation in debt-for-nature swaps has been restricted primarily to countries where the risk of default on debt payments is high. In these circumstances, the funder can purchase the debt at well below its face value.\nIn a commercial debt-for-nature swap or three-party debt-for-nature swap, a non-governmental organization (NGO) acts as the funder/donor and purchases debt titles from commercial banks on the secondary market. Since the late 1980s, organizations such as Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund have participated in international debt-for-nature swaps. The NGO transfers the debt title to the debtor country, and in exchange the country agrees to either enact certain environmental policies or endow a government bond in the name of a conservation organization, with the aim of funding conservation programs.In total, recorded third-party debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$140 million in conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1).\n\nBilateral debt-for-nature swaps take place between two governments. In a bilateral swap, a creditor country forgives a portion of the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that country. An example of a bilateral swap occurred when the U.S. Government, under the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, forgave a portion of Jamaica's official debt obligations and allowed the payments on the balance to go into national funds that finance environmental conservation. These funds established the Environmental Foundation of Jamaica in 1993. Multilateral debt-for-nature swaps are similar to bilateral swaps but involve international transactions of more than two national governments. Recorded bilateral and multilateral debt-for-nature swaps have generated nearly US$900 million in total conservation funding from 1987-2010 (see Table 1). A closely related form of debt swap is a debt-for-efficiency swap.\n\nThe following table shows the countries which have received funds from swaps and the total recorded funds generated by each kind of swap.\nNature Conservancy, Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Oak Foundation and Global Environment Facility have previously provided funds to pay to the debts.\n\nDebt for nature swaps have often been described as agreements in which all parties benefit and that there are no disadvantages. The benefits to the debtor country, creditor, and conservation organizations are outlined below.\n\nThrough a debt-for-nature swap, a debtor country reduces its total outstanding external debt. The debtor country is able to buy back part of its debt in more favorable terms and pay for conservation initiatives rather than debt service. This leads to higher international purchasing power for the debtor country. Also, some argue that converting outstanding debts in USD to local currency debts lowers the long-term debt burden on developing countries. Additionally, debt-for-nature terms enable long-term planning and funding.\n\nIf the country is interested in funding conservation, debt-for-nature swaps provide an additional source of funds for that purpose. In contrast to debt-for-equity swaps, debt-for-nature swaps do not compromise national sovereignty since no property exchange takes place.\n\nEnvironmental benefits to the debtor country include but are not limited to:\n\nInvestment in conservation also demonstrates economic returns. For example, Costa Rica has put debt-for-nature funds to good use in establishing and improving parks and preserves, and it has seen marked improvements in tourism, improved water quality, and increased energy output even in the short term.\n\nCreditors see debt-for-nature swaps as a method to rid themselves of high-risk claims. By selling the debt claim, they can re-invest the proceeds from the sale in higher-performing ventures. Creditors faced with low-performance loans may also seek to limit their exposure, that is, to avoid further lending to debtor countries until their loans are serviced.\n\nDebt-for-nature agreements are a long-term source of funding for conservation initiatives, so both international organizations acting as donors and local organizations using funds are able to further their goals of conservation. The donor organizations also purchase the debt at a value below its face value and usually redeem it above its market value. In this way, swaps are thought to generate conservation funds at a discount.\n\nThe decline in the number of debt-for-nature swaps in recent years likely results in part from the higher prices of commercial debt in secondary markets. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, conservation organizations could purchase relatively large debt obligations on the secondary market at highly discounted rates. During this period, conservation organizations and national governments negotiated swaps at a rate of approximately five agreements per year. Since 2000, the number of swap agreements has dropped to about two per year.\nAdditionally, other agreements for debt restructuring and cancellation, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, lower a developing country’s debt obligation by much more than the relatively small contribution debt-for-nature swaps make.\nAlso, debt-for-nature swaps have undergone thorough critique by skeptics; these criticisms may have contributed to the decline of the debt-for-nature financing mechanism.\n\nDebt-for-nature swaps produce only minor debt reductions and generate far less funding than the face value of the debt purchased in the secondary market. The amount of public debt relieved by debt-for-nature swaps, even in the countries that participate in swaps regularly, accounts for less than 1% of total external debt.\nAlso, if the indebted country does not engage in conservation in the absence of a debt-for-nature agreement, the swap may not provide the indebted country a social welfare improvement or any fiscal space in the national budget. The government of the indebted country is still responsible for payment of the debt, albeit to a conservation organization rather than to the creditor. Also, the funds produced through the agreement may replace other forms of aid, debt assistance, or conservation funding.\n\nCritics of debt-for-nature swaps argue that they do not generate funds where the needs are greatest. Early in the history of debt-for-nature swaps, nearly three-quarters of the total funds generated went to Costa Rica, while other countries with needs equal to or exceeding those of Costa Rica did not receive any. Brazil, for example, has had limited involvement in debt-for-nature swaps though it has experienced rapid deforestation.\n\nResearch has shown that debt relief alone does not spur environmental conservation. Though debt shows a positive correlation with deforestation levels, most researchers believe that highly indebted countries lack political institutions and enforcement structures that would limit environmental degradation. Heavily indebted countries may engage in high levels of deforestation due to shortsighted policies. Some suggest that the solutions to environmental degradation are effective political institutions, democracy, property rights, and market structures, and this development theory matches many of the principles of the Washington Consensus. Others suggest that primarily wealth creation and increased income have a positive impact on environmental conservation. This approach considers an environmental Kuznets curve, by which environmental degradation increases, reaches a tipping point, then decreases as income or wealth increases.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility of conservation lies with the local non-governmental organization implementing the protection measures. Debt-for-nature swaps are only effective when the conservation organizations are respected by local residents, have a good financial management capacity, and have a good relationship with government and other non-governmental organizations.\n\nDebt for nature swaps are usually actioned by an indebted nation's elite, not the peasantry who may traditionally have owned or at least used the land in question. Land rights are often expressed in different ways and ownership takes many forms. Some early debt-for-nature swaps tended to overlook the people living on the land set aside for conservation. Subsequent swaps have sought to include local residents, especially indigenous peoples, in the decision making process and the management of lands. Although \"seeking\" to include does not mean that local residents have been included. Reports of recent debt swap cases in Madagascar, for instance, indicate local resentment towards conservation projects.\n"}
{"id": "4279706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4279706", "title": "Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits", "text": "Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits\n\nEdifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits, also Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits was published on March 13, 1847, by Søren Kierkegaard. The book is divided into three parts just as \"Either/Or\" was in 1843 and many of his other discourses were. Kierkegaard had been working toward creating a place for the concepts of guilt and sin in the conscience of the single individual. He discussed the ideas generated by both Johann von Goethe and Friedrich Hegel concerning reason and nature. This book is his response to the ideas that nature and reason are perfect.\n\nThe first part of the book is a challenge to those who say they are not guilty of anything. Kierkegaard plays the questioner and asks tough questions throughout the text, such as, \"What is patience? Is not patience the courage that freely takes upon itself the suffering that cannot be avoided?\" \"Are you now living in such a way that you are aware of being a single individual and thereby aware of your eternal responsibility before God.\" \"Is not evil, just like evil people, at odds with itself, divided in itself?\" \"What is it to be more ashamed before others than before oneself but to be more ashamed of seeming than being?\" \"Should not he who planted the ear hear? But is not the opposite conclusion just as beautiful and convincing: Should not he whose life is sacrificing love believe that God is love?\" \"What means do you use to perform your work; is the means just as important to you as the end, just exactly as important?\"\n\nThe second part has to do with the idea that nature is perfect. He goes back to Job as he did in his Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843. He says, \"The silent friends did not compare Job with themselves—this did not happen until their respect (in which they silently held him) ceased and they broke the silence in order to attack the sufferer with speeches, but their presence prompted Job to compare himself with himself. No individual can be present, even though in silence, in such a way that his presence means nothing at all by way of comparison. At best, this can be done by a child, who indeed has a certain likeness to the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.\" \"God isolated the human being, made every human being this separate and distinct individual, which is implied in the unconditional character of those first thoughts. The individual animal is not isolated, is not unconditionally separate entity; the individual animal is a number and belongs under what that most famous pagan thinker has called the animal category: the crowd. The human being who in despair turns away from those first thoughts in order to plunge into the crowd of comparisons makes himself a number, regards himself as a beast, no matter whether he by way of comparison is distinguished or lowly. But with the lilies the worried one is isolated, far away from all human or, perhaps more correctly, inhuman comparisons between individuals.\"\n\nThe third part deals with the concept of the abstract and the concrete examples. Kierkegaard wrote of individuals known only as A and B in his first book, \"Either/Or\". He then made them less abstract by making A into the Young Man in \"Repetition\" (1843) and B into his guide, the psychiatrist Constantin Constantius. The same day that he published Repetition he published \"Fear and Trembling\" which showed Abraham as an individual who was alone with God as he considered whether to follow his commands. He continued writing until he came to the concrete human being named Christ and wrote about the joy there is in following Christ. He's not against the ethics of Hegel or the aesthetics of Goethe but thinks that following Christ is the one thing needful. And that double-mindedness is the beginning of the sickness of the spirit for the single individual.\n\nThe book begins with a dedication just as some of his \"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses\" did, however, this book is not dedicated to his father, but to “That Single Individual”. He published these discourses and later wrote a longer dedication called \"The Crowd is Untruth\" where he wrote: This, which is now considerably revised and enlarged, was written and intended to accompany the dedication to \"that single individual,\" which is found in \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits.\" Copenhagen, Spring 1847.\n\nWalter Lowrie translated \"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\" by Kierkegaard in 1939, 1962 and included \"My Activity as a Writer\" by Soren Kierkegaard (1851) in the book. Here Kierkegaard wrote, \"I attached myself again religiously to \"that individual\", to whom the next essential work (after the Concluding Postscript) was dedicated. I refer to \"Edifying Discourses in Divers Spirits\", or rather the first part of that book which is an exhortation to confession. Perhaps nobody noticed it the first time I employed the category \"that individual\", and nobody paid much attention to the fact that it was repeated in stereotyped form in the preface of every number of the \"Edifying Discourses\". Religiously speaking, there is no such thing as a public, but only individuals; for religion is seriousness and seriousness is the individual.\"\n\nThis book has a preface and Kierkegaard has said to pay attention to the prefaces in his book of the same name. The book also has a dedication. Here is the first half of his preface. Kierkegaard thinks an individual must bring the occasion (the need) along with him or her to become the learner. \n\n\"On the Occasion of a Confession\" was a postscript to the first section of \"Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions\" (On the Occasion of a Confessional Service). This section has also been titled \"Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\"\n\nKierkegaard asks how an individual can find out if he or she is on the \"right\" path in life. Confession and repentance before God is his answer with a warning about double-mindedness. If a single individual were to ask him or herself all the questions asked in this section and try discover all the evasions used to keep from acting single-mindedly, that person would discover that it is very difficult to say I am innocent. In \"Works of Love\" (1847) he asks his reader to \"Imagine an enthusiast who enthusiastically wills only one thing and enthusiastically wants to sacrifice everything for the good.\" Here he is writing about the inwardness of prayer. He says, \n\nHe asks, \"What does the conscience want to emphasize by means of the awareness that you are a single individual?\" (Hong p. 132) He answers this way: To will, in the decision, to be and to remain with the good is truth's brief expression for willing to do everything, and in this expression the equality is maintained that recognizes no distinction with regard to that more essential diversity of life or of the human condition: to be acting or to be suffering, since the one who is suffering can, in the decision, also be with the good. …. With respect to the highest, with respect to willing to do everything, it makes no difference at all, God be praised, how big or how little the task. Oh, how merciful the eternal is to us human beings! Soren Kierkegaard, \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\", Hong p. 79–80\n\nLater, in Works of Love, Kierkegaard sums up the essence of what it means to have a pure heart using a metaphors from Archimedes and the New Testament. \n\nThe first discourse (\"To Be Contented with Being a Human Being\") deals with comparison and choice and how to trust God with the choice once made. He may have been echoing Goethe's Propylaen in which Goethe had written \"The youth, when Nature and Art attract him, thinks that with a vigorous effort he can soon penetrate into the innermost sanctuary; the man, after long wanderings, finds himself still in the outer court. Such an observation has suggested our title. It is only on the step, in the gateway, the entrance, the vestibule, the space between the outside and the inner chamber, between the sacred and the common, that we may ordinarily tarry with our friends.\" Kierkegaard writes about nature differently than Goethe but similarly because both see Nature as teachers of human kind and Kierkegaard wrote very much about \"the inner being\"; the soul.\n\nKierkegaard wrote a great story about a lily and a naughty bird. It begins like this: \n\nThe second discourse deals with diverting oneself from worries by \"learning from the bird how glorious it is to be a human being.\" David F. Swenson translated several of Kierkegaard's discourses which were published in 1958 through the efforts of Paul L Holmer. Kierkegaard wrote of \"The Glory of Our Common Humanity\". This was the second of three discourses that were all based on the text from Matthew 6 verses 24 to the end. It was titled \"How Glorious It Is to Be a Human Being\" by Howard V Hong when he translated Kierkegaard's book in 1993.\n\nThe structure of the three discourses about the lilies and the birds is as follows: the first is esthetic, the second ethical, the third religious. \"Journal and Papers of Soren Kierkegaard\" VIII A 1 1847\n\nKierkegaard writes about the gift given to human beings that nature doesn't have, conscience. With the use of conscience we can know about time and the future. Something nature cannot know. He sums the human ability to love and the distinctiveness of nature up in Works of Love, which he published four months later. \n\nThe third discourse was titled \"What Blessed Happiness is Promised in Being a Human Being\" by Howard V Hong. Kierkegaard is constantly stressing the importance there is in being a human being instead of a beast in the field because you have been given the gift of choice. \"A choice. My listener, do you know how to express in a single word anything more glorious! If you talked year in and year out, could you mention anything more glorious than a choice, to have choice! It is certainly true that the sole blessing is to choose rightly, but certainly choice itself is the glorious condition.\" Kierkegaard began writing about this choice in his first book \"Either/Or\" where he wrote first as the aesthetic and then as the ethicist. Hegel thinks that history and philosophy should come afterwards and explain events. Kierkegaard thinks its better to come beforehand.Only one word more concerning the desire to teach the world what it ought to be. For such a purpose philosophy at least always comes too late. Philosophy, as the thought of the world, does not appear until reality has completed its formative process, and made itself ready. History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva takes its flight only when the shades of night are gathering.\nSpiritually understood, temporality and eternity are two magnitudes that are to be weighed. But in order to deliberate the person in turn must be a third party or have a third position in relation to the two magnitudes. This is the choice: he weighs, he deliberates, he chooses. Here, however there is never any chance that the two magnitudes weigh equally much, which can of course happen with a scale, it indicates the relation as one of equality. No, praise God, that can never happen, because properly understood the eternal already has a certain overweight and the person who refuses to understand this can never begin really to deliberate. So a person deliberates before he begins. \n\nKierkegaard stresses not only having a choice but learning how to use it. He concludes, \"But then in his sadness out there with the lily and the bird the worried one did indeed acquire something other than his worry to think about; he began to consider what blessed happiness is promised in being a human being. Then let the lily wither and let its loveliness become indiscernible; let the leaf fall to the ground and the bird fly away; let it become dark on the fields—God's kingdom does not change with the seasons! So let the rest be needed for a long time or a short time, let all these things have their moment when they are lacking or possessed, their moment is a subject of discussion until in death they are eternally forgotten—God's kingdom is still that which is to be sought first but which ultimately will also last through all eternities, and \"if that which will be abolished was glorious, that which remains will be more glorious,: and if it was hard to live in want, then it must indeed be only an easier separation to die to want!\n\nA.S Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie from Cambridge University translated \"The Gospel of Sufferings\" in 1955. The following is from his introduction. \n\nNow he begins to write of the meaning and joy there is in following Christ. It wasn't the first thing he wrote about but he did write about learning, over time, to follow Christ and while learning to also learn to confess, repent and accept as well as give forgiveness. His emphasis has been on seeking God's kingdom first (Matthew 6:33) and learning to be \"silent before God\".\n\nHis first three texts are from Luke 14:27 \"Whoever does not carry his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\" Matthew 11:30 \"My yoke is beneficial, and my burden light.\" and \"It is said of him the Lord Jesus Christ: Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered\" Hebrews 5:8. Acts 5:41 Kierkegaard writes about why it might not be so great to have the \"distinction\" of being an apostle. \"they went away joyful because they had been deemed worthy to be scorned for the sake of Christ's name\". He concluded this way: \n\nKierkegaard compared a pound of gold and a pound of feathers. He views the pound of feathers as a lesser weight because of the value of gold compared to feathers. He then asks the reader to decide if a pound of temporality is equal to a pound of eternity. Feathers and gold and temporality and eternity and numbers all have value in this world. He has seven different discourses in this third section. He seems to be using religious numbers generally while writing but always referring to Christianity specifically.\n\nKierkegaard seems to have fulfilled his goal presented in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he said it had become clear to him that people had forgotten what it means to be religious (confession and repentance before God) and had also forgotten what it means to be a human being and had therefore also forgotten what it means to try to become a Christian. He put it this way. \n\n\"Edifiying Discourses in Diverse Spirits\", also \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" was published on March 13, 1847, and is one of the first books in Søren Kierkegaard's second authorship. His first authorship included all of his books up to and including \"\" which was published March 30, 1846. He had just published his \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\" to \"Philosophical Fragments\" on February 27, 1846. He wrote both pseudonymous books as well as books signed by his own name. His \"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses\" were all signed by Soren Kierkegaard as author while other books, such as, \"Either/Or\", \"Repetition\", and \"The Concept of Anxiety\" were published under pseudonyms. Howard V. Hong says the book had no record of sales and was not reprinted in Kierkegaard's lifetime.\n\nPreviously Kierkegaard had published his own books through two different bookstores, Bookdealer P. G. Philipsen \"Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843\" and C.A. Reitzel's, Printed by Biance Luno Press \"Repetition\". This book was published \"on an honorarium basis\" through another Danish book publisher, Reitzel Forlag. The publishing cost was minimum.\n\nThe first section was translated into English in 1938 by Douglas V. Steere and titled \"Purity of Heart Is To Will One Thing\". Steere also wrote the introduction to David F Swenson's 1946 translation of \"Works of Love\". Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated all the discourses and Princeton University Press published them in 1993. Scholars generally paid more attention to his pseudonymous writings than his discourses.\n\nHarold Victor Martin published \"Kierkegaard, the Melancholy Dane\" (1950) and had this to say about this book: \nRobert L Perkins of Stetson University edited \"The International Kierkegaard Commentary Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" in 2005. This book presents scholarly perspectives regarding from people interested in the writings of Soren Kierkegaard. He states that A.S. Aldworth and W.S. Ferrie published \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" in three parts \"Purify your Hearts\" (1937), \"Consider the Lilies\" (1940) and \"Gospel of Suffering\" (1955), the 1955 edition was reprinted in an American edition in 1964. Gospel of Sufferings and The Lilies of the Field were translated by David F Swenson and Lillian Marvin Swenson in 1948. Perkin's book is in External Links below.\n\nDouglas V. Steere wrote a lengthy introduction to his 1938 publication of the first part of Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits. \"Purify your Heart\" of 1937 became \"Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing\" in the hands of Steere in 1938. He says Eduard Geismar (1871–1939), the Danish scholar, said of the book, \"It seems to me that nothing that he has written has sprung so directly out of his relationship with God as this address. Anyone who wishes to understand Kierkegaard properly will do well to begin with it.\"\n\nSteere wrote \"Doors Into Life\" in 1948 and devoted his fourth chapter to Kierkegaard and \"Purity of Heart\". He said, \"In a strangely universal way, Kierkegaard is both ancient and modern, both a fierce desert prophet and a metropolitan sophisticate who is all too well schooled in the artifices of modern life to be deceived by them.\"\n\nGeismar lectured on Kierkegaard at Princeton University in 1936. He wrote the following about this book, \n\nHoward V Hong translated the wrote book in 1993 along with his wife Edna H Hong. It was translated again in 2005. Hong's 1993 introduction surmised that Kierkegaard perhaps published 500 copies of this book during his lifetime.\n\n\"Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions\" & \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" were reviewed together in 1994 by Karl Dusza for \"First Things Magazine\" He wrote \n\nKierkegaard wrote about the expectation of the Christian. The difference Christ made in the world is that he took away the burdens of the Christian. Kierkegaard wrote much about the consciousness of sin and wrote about the difference Christianity makes. \n\nJames Collins, from Saint Louis University, wrote the following about Kierkegaard's \"Gospel of Suffering\" in 1953. \"Find a point which is under fire by an atheist of the nineteenth century and which is also defended by a seventeenth century man of faith and you have found an incontrovertibly religious belief. Such is the case with suffering, which is a scandal to a Feuerbach and a matter of glory to a Pascal, but to both a distinguishing note of the Christian mode of existence. In the degree that it promotes a meditative inwardness, Christianity makes us aware of God's supreme goodness and our own distance from, and hostility towards, His holiness. A religious sense of one's own sinfulness leads neither to morbid despair nor to rationalization. It issues in a voluntary acceptance of suffering as a way of atoning for sin to God, the just judge, and a way of approaching closer to God the redeemer. In a series of discourses entitled \"The Gospel of Suffering\", Kierkegaard establishes the relation between guilt, suffering, and the triumph of faith, much after the manner of Luther's dialectical treatment of the theme of the sinner as a believer.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52148295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52148295", "title": "Embedded feminism", "text": "Embedded feminism\n\nEmbedded feminism is the attempt of state authorities to legitimize an intervention in a conflict by co-opting feminist discourses and instrumentalizing feminist activists and groups for their own agenda. This term was introduced in the analysis of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but can also be applied to several historical examples where women's rights were used as justification and legitimization of Western interventionism.\n\nOriginally, the Canadian gender researcher Krista Hunt developed the conceptual framework of embedded feminism to describe the gendered nature of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the practice of the US government to justify the War on Terror in the eyes of the public.\nHunt defines the concept as the \"incorporation of feminist discourse and feminist activists into political projects that claim to serve the interests of women, but ultimately subordinate and/or subvert that goal\".\nHunt coined the term embedded feminism referring to the \"embedded journalism\" or \"embedded media\" approach of the US Department of Defense which became prominent in the media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The US government attached journalists, photographers, and camera people to military units and granted them unprecedented access to the battle frontline. Although \"embedded journalism\" allowed the public to get an exclusive look at the situation in Iraq, this practice was regarded as problematic, as it could undermine the independent reporting and promote the preferences of the government.\n\nThe \"far-reaching process of appropriating and subverting feminism through appeals to women's rights\" that is embedded feminism is different from simple co-optation practices by state authorities in so far as it goes beyond the absorption \"of the meanings of the original concepts to fit into the prevailing political priorities\".\n\nKrista Hunt argues that appeals to women's liberation have been embedded in political projects for centuries to mobilize feminists and their discourses.\nA large body of feminist literature has analyzed the gender-related dimensions of (post-) colonial projects where feminists from the Global North were convinced to get involved in order to \"save\" other oppressed women. Such rescue narratives generally presuppose a homogeneity of women as an oppressed group, as showed in the work of Chandra Mohanty, and put into play the orientalized nature of the seemingly dangerous \"brown man\". Thus, feminism which was incorporated in the modernization and civilization projects of imperial countries is argued to have helped strengthening colonialism and patriarchy instead of promoting women's rights.\nFeminists also claim that feminist activists and their discourses have been instrumentalized for nationalist projects. During the Nasser era in Egypt for example, feminists are said to have played a major role in helping create a sense of cohesion and bonding and therefore directly contributed to the emergence of a national identity during and after the struggle for independence. Nevertheless, women remained mostly absent from the public sphere of politics once the project succeed.\nThe history of the war on terrorism throughout the IR realm consistently showcased a male-stream discipline and a hyper-masculine war hero narrative. In other words, the story is narrated by these men, who hold high positions of power and are fixated to exemplify their heroic qualities to shield women from harm and collide with the world’s difficulties. For example, according to the former US President, George W. Bush, the central goal of the terrorists is the brutal oppression of women…that is the reason this great nation, with our friends and allies, will not rest until we bring them all to justice . This rallying cry by the Bush administration is exactly the narrative that is at question. The time-honored tradition of the good guys defeating the bad guys and protecting racialized women serves to reinforce patriotism and justify violence both abroad and at home. However, how does one exemplify “the bad guys”? By using a gendered lens and looking at the war of terror through a gendered perspective, a simple rallying cry has far more complexities. For instance, there is a power dynamic at play here involving two opposing parties. There is the Western men and women who are deemed to be the saviors. Then there are the Afghan women who needs saving. What does this do? This creates a subtle social construct that the war on terror has created different kinds of men and women based on race, religion and nationality . Having said that, a gendered lens does ignore specific factors. It ignores the power dynamic of liberated white western women against their oppressed Afghan women. Basically, in a war, your race and nationality come heavily into play when it comes to who is deemed to be more liberated. It ignores the historical colonial justification for invasion by proclaiming racialized men are harmful to racialized women. Feminists analyzed Bush’s rallying cry and found similarities to the white men knowing what’s right and saving the racialized women because of perceptions about the racialized men. It ignores the reinforced resistance to women’s rights, whereas men see it as Western imposition. In a war situation, when a Western country tries to help an oppressed nation, it is seen as western imposition because it is as if “the west knows best”, without even being apart or living in an oppressed nation and gives the perception that anything the West does (even empowering women) is treated as imposition. It ignores the obscurity of the reality that white Western women are still being oppressed by the same powers that are trying to liberate Afghan women. Finally, it ignores the overarching point of all these factors which is the creation of a divide and conquer situation of women while also initiating solidarity of all women . In other words, what all these factors mean is the examination of race, class, nationality, religion and sexuality, we notice factors that were passive such as progressing onward with political agendas that are traditional, old testament and problematic while also trying to play the good guy by silencing other related key issues. In conclusion, Gender has become a topic that is heavily scrutinized but also heavily appreciated and even in the most traditional of scenarios, a gender lens/perspective is very much needed to tackle the real issue of IR.\n\nIn 2001, the Bush administration began expressing their concerns for the situation of women under the Taliban regime. According to Hunt, it invoked the struggle for women's rights and women's liberation as a rational to justify the invasion of Afghanistan. This increased gender awareness can be interpreted as part of a framing strategy which conflated the War on Terror with the fight for women's rights as a proxy for universal human rights. In the eyes of many feminists, the rescue of oppressed women from the Taliban became the powerful normative legitimation of the invasion which obtained broad public approval. More importantly, this strategy could align itself with feminist groups, that are traditionally pacifist, and could win their approval, thereby removing a critical opposition. The doubts in the government's commitment to further women's rights through war arose due to its lack of interest before 9/11. It was only after the terror attacks, that politicians in the US and in Europe began broadly supporting women's liberation from the Taliban.\nDespite its usual non-violent stance, the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) supporter the policies of the Bush administration and is therefore regarded as one of the most vocal feminist supporters embedded in the War on Terror. Although the FMF saw the government's increased gender awareness as a success of their ‘Stop Gender Apartheid’ campaign, their involvement in Bush's political project was strongly criticized by other NGOs and the critical public because their role was considered to be legitimizing.\nHunt sees embedded feminism as a concept that was used to advance the engendered war story of the Bush administration that the invasion of Afghanistan could liberate Afghan women. It has further created a division between feminist groups that supported the war and those groups that refused to get involved in the usurpation of feminism for war. A division also emerged between \"Western\" feminists who strived to save the \"Other\" women from an orientalised enemy and Afghan feminists who criticized the notion that war could liberate them.\n\nHunt notes that there is a striking similarity between the logic of embedded feminism in colonialist projects and the War on Terror. Both are inherently Eurocentric and present the West as culturally and normatively superior to the \"unmodern\" Eastern societies. This rationale would give the West a prerogative to intervene and rescue the \"monolithic group\" of Other women who have no agency on their own. Spivak's famous post-colonial critique of the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized subjects in \"Can the Subaltern speak?\" condenses this relationship to the strategy of \"white men saving brown women from brown men\". This analysis can also be applied to the seemingly neo-imperialist strategy that the US government was pursuing by framing Taliban men in Afghanistan as a danger to women who were presented as victims in need of help from the West.\nCharacteristic for Western hegemonic feminism was the disregard of Western actors for the opinions of Afghan women's groups who argued that a war would certainly have a negative impact on women and fuel fundamentalist sentiments. In the aftermath, Bush's agenda was in fact interpreted as an attack on Islamic values and resulted in a backlash from the conservative forces.\nHegemonic feminism also tends to reproduce binary gender roles, especially in the visual representation of women and children as victims of war or oppression in the media. Cynthia Enloe has called this conflation of women and children as victimized subjects \"womenandchildren\", a single trope that is being invoked in patriarchic narratives to support state security interests.\n\nThe unique nature of embedded feminism as a state strategy is not just the argumentation based on the representation of women and children as victims but the conjunction of this discourse with the struggle for women's rights. \nHunt's concept has made an impact on gender-related conflict research and has been applied to the wars in Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Embedded feminism can also be used in other contexts such as neo-liberal globalization and can be applied to several other policy fields where pseudo-feminist arguments and feminist groups are misused to legitimize a state-led action or to construct an alternative story.\n\n\n"}

He was educated at the college of Juilly, he served in the army until 1697.\n\nPrimarily remembered as an early modern historian of the French State, Boulainvilliers also published an early French translation of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" and wrote on topics as diverse as astrology, physics, philosophy and theology.\n\nThe Comte de Boulainvilliers traced his lineage to the House of Croÿ, to Jean de Croÿ, sire de Clery et de Boulainviller, who died in the Battle of Poitiers (1356). At the time of his birth, however, the family's fortune had declined significantly. Much of Boulainvilliers' historical work and political life centered on the decline of the nobility.\n\nIn 1669, Henri de Boulainvilliers went to study at the Collège de Juilly, one of the most famous schools of the Congregation of the Oratory of Philip Neri. Exact sciences, history and geography were taught there. \nThe philosopher Malebranche being one of the great educators at the Oratory, cartesianism was allowed reference in the classroom from 1662 till 1675 when it was banned by Royal arrest. \nIn 1673, Henry studied rhetoric with his teacher Richard Simon, who was excluded from the Oratory (1678) because of his critical Bible studies.\n\nThe education at Juilly had great impact on Boulainvilliers: a special accent on critical history had been introduced into the Oratory by Caesar Baronius and Richard Simon, and through the science classes he became familiar with the works of Jean Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle and Edme Mariotte.\n\nSince he had also received private lessons in the German language, it is not inconceivable that he was able to read van Helmont in Middle Dutch that author used as a critical means to an accessible reading of medicine in the Low Countries, and which so fluently worded his rich independence of mind.\n\nIn 1683 Boulainvilliers wrote \" \"l'Idée d'un Système Général de la Nature\" based on his reading of Jan Baptist van Helmont and Robert Boyle, followed by \"Archidoxes de Paracelsus, avec une préface sur les principes de l'art chimique\".\n\nBy 1715-1720, he wrote his \"Traité d'astronomie physique\" using the Cartesian method, commenting on the nature of gravity and the movement of planets and drawing on sources such as Jean-Baptiste du Hamel and Huygens.\n\nHe described his method as experimental philosophy and closely preceded the Dutch experimentalists led by Anthony Leeuwenhoek (Nieuwentijt, Boerhave, Volder)\n\nHe retained affection for astrology, for which he was famous in Court gossip.\n\nIn a \"Lettre à Mlle Cousinot sur l'histoire de France et le choix des historiens\"\" he explained why the writing of history was to be more than the \"amateur\" collection of dates and anecdotes related to old coins (numismatics) and stones: The knowledge of history pertained to a distinct moral character of society. Related causes of past events, such as the 1346 Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, could be instructive on related measures in the present — how to do things better or worse. Sometimes we want to know not only what a historical figure has done, but by what right he might have done so differently.\n\nHe stressed in his writings the corruption absolutism played in the fall of France when he contrasts the role English and French historians were able to investigate history. For instance, when stressing the importance of sources in developing fact, he contrasted Thomas Rymer's way of access to the London archives to that of his own where he had to bribe the keepers of the French archives. For his neutral reasoning, his works were cited by subsequent writers whose works would prove influential in the development of Western political thought and historical research.\n\nParallel to his historical studies ran an untiring interest in philosophy which he wrote down in \"Considérations abrégées des operations de l'entendement sur les idées\" on the model borrowed from the famous \"Port-Royal Logic\" by Antoine Arnauld: psychology of the mind, logic, and method; to which he added ontology. His influences, apart from the Schola of his early education, were Gassendi, Descartes, Malebranche, Locke and Spinoza.\n\nBoulainvilliers's translation of Spinoza's \"Ethics\" was not published until 1907 by Colonna d'Istria from an unsigned manuscript at Lyon.\n\nBoulainvilliers's study of Spinoza, as captured in the collected treatises published by Renée Simon (1973), shows an exceptional development from a basic criticism to an enlightened understanding marked by the incredibly generous way in which he let his opponent use his own voice.\n\nIn the \"Essay de Métaphysique dans les principes de B...de Sp...\" he translated Spinoza's \"geometrical method\" into an accessible French, closely following its original meaning without incisive criticism.\n\nIn the \"Exposition du système de Benoit Spinosa et sa defense contre les objections de M. Régis\" he voiced the defense of Spinoza against his cartesian critic Pierre-Sylvain Régis. The comte Boulainvilliers was no blind follower of Descartes; he knew how to make use of his method, but he could equally well criticise him on metaphysical points.\n\nThis unusual way of writing philosophy led to the gossip that he was a Spinozist and therefore an atheist. Yet in his persistent criticism of Spinoza's monism (through the concept of the \"unity of substance\"), in writings inaccessible to the multitude, his independent judgement remained unspoilt. After his death his name was frequently used to circulate anti-religious treatises, leading to still more confusion about his intellectual identity.\n\nWith Matthieu Marais he shared a friendship with another great student of Spinoza, Pierre Bayle.\n\nLess well known but as important in his time was the similar treatment he gave to the mysticism of Molinos in : \"Extrait du livre du ministre Pierre Jurieu touchant les dogmes des mystiques et particulièrement contre Messieurs de Cambray et de Méaux.\" By the time the reader finished his lecture he had a complete survey of the works of Molinos, thus recapitulating the famous disagreements over Quietism.\n\nSuch are the traits that can make one regret the criticism — amply justified in retrospect — that Boulainvilliers, elsewhere, brought over himself by his brutal stance on feudalism; traits for which he equally deserves to be known to a larger circle of students.\n\nBoulainvilliers wrote a number of historical works (published after his death), of which the most important were the following:\n\n\n"}

In this case, \"X\" is homogeneous if intuitively \"X\" looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of \"G\" be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of \"G\" on \"X\" which can be thought of as preserving some \"geometric structure\" on \"X\", and making \"X\" into a single \"G\"-orbit.\n\nLet \"X\" be a non-empty set and \"G\" a group. Then \"X\" is called a \"G\"-space if it is equipped with an action of \"G\" on \"X\". Note that automatically \"G\" acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If \"X\" in addition belongs to some category, then the elements of \"G\" are assumed to act as automorphisms in the same category. Thus, the maps on \"X\" affected by \"G\" are structure preserving. A homogeneous space is a \"G\"-space on which \"G\" acts transitively.\n\nSuccinctly, if \"X\" is an object of the category C, then the structure of a \"G\"-space is a homomorphism:\n\ninto the group of automorphisms of the object \"X\" in the category C. The pair (\"X\", ρ) defines a homogeneous space provided ρ(\"G\") is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of \"X\".\n\nFor example, if \"X\" is a topological space, then group elements are assumed to act as homeomorphisms on \"X\". The structure of a \"G\"-space is a group homomorphism ρ : \"G\" → Homeo(\"X\") into the homeomorphism group of \"X\".\n\nSimilarly, if \"X\" is a differentiable manifold, then the group elements are diffeomorphisms. The structure of a \"G\"-space is a group homomorphism ρ : \"G\" → Diffeo(\"X\") into the diffeomorphism group of \"X\".\n\nRiemannian symmetric spaces are an important class of homogeneous spaces, and include many of the examples listed below.\n\nConcrete examples include:\n\n\n\nFrom the point of view of the Erlangen program, one may understand that \"all points are the same\", in the geometry of \"X\". This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before Riemannian geometry, in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nThus, for example, Euclidean space, affine space and projective space are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective symmetry groups. The same is true of the models found of non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature, such as hyperbolic space.\n\nA further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by \"line co-ordinates\": these are the 2×2 minors of the 4×2 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the line geometry of Julius Plücker.\n\nIn general, if \"X\" is a homogeneous space, and \"H\" is the stabilizer of some marked point \"o\" in \"X\" (a choice of origin), the points of \"X\" correspond to the left cosets \"G\"/\"H\", and the marked point \"o\" corresponds to the coset of the identity. Conversely, given a coset space \"G\"/\"H\", it is a homogeneous space for \"G\" with a distinguished point, namely the coset of the identity. Thus a homogeneous space can be thought of as a coset space without a choice of origin.\n\nIn general, a different choice of origin \"o\" will lead to a quotient of \"G\" by a different subgroup \"H\" which is related to \"H\" by an inner automorphism of \"G\". Specifically,\n\nwhere \"g\" is any element of \"G\" for which \"go\" = \"o\"′. Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such \"g\" is selected; it depends only on \"g\" modulo \"H\".\n\nIf the action of \"G\" on \"X\" is continuous, then \"H\" is a closed subgroup of \"G\". In particular, if \"G\" is a Lie group, then \"H\" is a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem. Hence \"G\"/\"H\" is a smooth manifold and so \"X\" carries a unique smooth structure compatible with the group action.\n\nIf \"H\" is the identity subgroup {\"e\"}, then \"X\" is a principal homogeneous space.\n\nOne can go further to \"double\" coset spaces, notably Clifford–Klein forms \"Γ\"\\\"G\"/\"H\", where \"Γ\" is a discrete subgroup (of \"G\") acting properly discontinuously.\n\nFor example, in the line geometry case, we can identify H as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional general linear group, GL(4), defined by conditions on the matrix entries\n\nby looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that \"X\" has dimension 4.\n\nSince the homogeneous coordinates given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact, a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers.\n\nThis example was the first known example of a Grassmannian, other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.\n\nThe idea of a prehomogeneous vector space was introduced by Mikio Sato.\n\nIt is a finite-dimensional vector space \"V\" with a group action of an algebraic group \"G\", such that there is an orbit of \"G\" that is open for the Zariski topology (and so, dense). An example is GL(1) acting on a one-dimensional space.\n\nThe definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as \"castling\".\n\nPhysical cosmology using the general theory of relativity makes use of the Bianchi classification system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the space part of background metrics for some cosmological models; for example, the three cases of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the Mixmaster universe represents an anisotropic example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.\n\nA homogeneous space of \"N\" dimensions admits a set of formula_14 Killing vectors. For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields formula_15,\n\nwhere the object formula_17, the \"structure constants\", form a constant order-three tensor antisymmetric in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and \";\" represents the covariant differential operator). In the case of a flat isotropic universe, one possibility is formula_18 (type I), but in the case of a closed FLRW universe, formula_19 where formula_20 is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\n\n"}

I cc. 1 and 4, it was provided that anyone, either a constable or a private citizen, who witnessed a crime shall make hue and cry, and that the hue and cry must be kept up against the fleeing criminal from town to town and from county to county, until the felon is apprehended and delivered to the sheriff. All able-bodied men, upon hearing the shouts, were obliged to assist in the pursuit of the criminal, which makes it comparable to the \"posse comitatus\". It was moreover provided that \"the whole hundred … shall be answerable\" for any theft or robbery, in effect a form of collective punishment.

Human chess is typically played outdoors, either on a large chessboard or on the ground, and is often played at Renaissance fairs. Many human chess games are choreographed stage shows performed by actors trained in stage combat. When this is the case, piece captures are represented by choreographed fights that determine whether the piece is actually taken or not. Alternatively, the pieces may spar, following rules similar to those used by the Society for Creative Anachronism.\n\nA costumed human chess game has been staged every two years on the second week in September in the Italian city of Marostica (less than 250 km from Milan), near Venice since 1923. The game commemorates a legendary chess game played in 1454 by two young knights in order to settle which of them would court the lady that both had fallen in love with. The event lasts 3 days. The participants of the game dress historic clothes. The human chess game has strict rules which have been set by a specific committee. The performance lasts 30 minutes. \n\nIn terms of the Japanese game of shogi, an annual festival in Tendō, Yamagata held every late April has an event called , where people involved alongside large shogi pieces with stands are dressed in Sengoku period costumes.

The project has the stated intention of collecting more than 100,000 individual photos from 175 cities around the world and using them to build one of the largest photo mosaics in history. In 2011, the project launched the official world tour in Sacramento, California. The project is estimated to take more than 7 years to complete and has the ultimate goal of unveiling an 8,000sq/ft mosaic in Washington DC containing all the photos collected during the world tour.\n\nThe documentary was created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer who said the campaign was meant to encourage individuals to get more active in educating, inspiring, and empowering their friends and family to make a positive difference in their communities and the world.\n\nCreated in Salt Lake City, Utah in late 2009, the campaign was developed in response to the founder's perceptions of a general social apathy prevailing in the world. They built the documentary with the intention of giving participants a reason to talk about the unique issues or causes they support, and to encourage those participants to take an active roll in improving their community.\n\nIn December 2009 Beckett and Spencer conceptualized the documentary project as a world tour campaign that would visit approximately 25 cities a year for 7 years and capture as many as 100,000 individual photos of people from all walks of life.\n\nBeginning in January 2010, Spencer started taking photos and testing the concept at his studio in Salt Lake City, Utah with only a few dozen photos at a time while Beckett started to build the associated websites and social media pages .\n\nIn January 2011, after 8 small events in Utah, the project launched its official world tour in Sacramento, California at The Citizen Hotel.\n\nTo participate in the campaign, individuals are encouraged to wear a solid brightly colored shirt and go to a public photo event in their area where a temporary tattoo with the logo \"I AM =\" is applied to the palm of their hand. They stand in front of the camera with the instructions to have the palm of their hand facing the camera as close to the face as possible, and they may be as creative as they want. The photographer snaps the photo and the entire process takes less than 5 minutes. Two weeks after the photo event, each participant receives an email with instructions on how to find their photo in the online gallery and social networks along with ideas on how to share it with friends and family. Each individual is also invited to share a \"PhotoStory\" as part of the photo essay project, where participants discuss the unique issues and causes they support.\n\nThe project creators said it is their first priority to ensure that it represents all people, issues, and causes rather than just the popular equality topic of the day. The expressed intention of the campaign is to get participants to speak up and discuss, with friends and family, the humanitarian, civil rights, conservation, and equality issues they support. They point out that through history the conversation of \"equality\" has had many causal champions such as the Women's Suffragette Movement, the Abolitionist movement, the Women's Rights movement, the Civil Rights, and the Gay & Lesbian movement, so the I Am Equal Photo Documentary was built to connect all of the issues of equality, human rights, civil liberties, and conservation into one massive conversation of mutual respect for all people while uniting individual participants in a common initiative to break a world record.\n\nSome of the issues and causes already represented by individuals participating in the I AM EQUAL Photo Documentary include autism, marriage equality, drug addiction, immigration reform, atheism, religious freedom, teen suicide, Downs Syndrome, gender equality, racism, poverty, incest rape, gay adoption, deaf/hearing impaired, bigotry, pansexuality, obesity, free speech, senior rights.\n\nThe campaign leverages the popularity of social networks to fuel the viral expansion of the project; participants are encouraged to use their photo on social media networks as a way to initiate conversations about the issue or cause represented by the individual. Some participants have taken their photo beyond the social networks by printing it on business cards or framing it in their house as a way to open a casual dialogue about their participation in the campaign.\n\nThe project founders assert that the simple act of sharing the photo or putting it on display may be all that is needed to open new conversations with co-workers, friends, family, and even perfect strangers about the big and small issues that these participants feel are facing the world today. Some participants have suggested that their I AM EQUAL photo has been an effective way to begin a dialogue on weightier human rights issues such as female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, rape incest, polygamy, and many other topics they feel would not normally be discussed in casual conversations.\n\nIn conjunction with Mayor Kevin Johnson's office and coordinating with the local Pride! Center, NAACP, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and the United Way, the photo documentary launched its first official tour stop on January 6, 2011, at The Citizen Hotel in Sacramento, California, the city TIME Magazine voted it to be the most diverse city in America.\n\nThe project returned to Salt Lake City and held a general public photo event on February 5, 2011, at The Sheraton Downtown Hotel where an additional 650 photos were added to the documentary collection. The project made its way to Las Vegas, Nevada, in partnership with MGM Resorts International for an event at The New York New York Hotel & Casino on February 19, 2011, where more than 500 resort employees participated in the documentary project along with the then Mayor Oscar Goodman, County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani, the dance troop The Jabbawockeez, as well as Terry Fator, and the Las Vegas cast of The Lion King at Mandalay Bay. While in Las Vegas, project founder Jason Beckett was invited to discuss the photo documentary project as a speaker at the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations, Jazzitudes at UNLV.\n\nThe project made its first stop outside the United States in Calgary, Alberta, Canada on May 28, 2011. During this stop, hundreds participated in the project including United States Olympic Gold Medalist, Steve Mesler on behalf of his non-profit organization Classroom Champions. Local service groups and organizations including the United Way of Canada, Child Find Alberta, AIDS Calgary, and the Calgary Scope Society all participated in the documentary project.\n\nWorking with the North Texas chapter of Get Equal, the I Am Equal Photo Documentary set up at the Aloft Dallas Hotel and took photos of more than 300 people. Project founder Beckett was invited to address the assembled crowd at the annual North Texas March for Equality on the steps of City Hall as the keynote speaker for the event.\n\nThe project was invited to the University of North Florida as part of their first annual 'Week of One' diversity celebration, created in part as a vehicle to showcase the project and allow students the opportunity to take part in the record-breaking campaign.\n\nIn February, the campaign made stops in Raleigh, North Carolina, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Columbus, Ohio. While in Tennessee, the project founders made a detour to stop in the small town of Whitwell to include this community of 1,600 people in the project. The founders wanted to include the people responsible for creating the Children's Holocaust Memorial (Paper Clips Project), created by students at the local middle school who collected more than 11 million paperclips from around the world and placed them into a rail car used to transport Jews, blacks, homosexuals, Jehova's Witnesses, and other people to concentration camps. The original teacher from the project, David Alan Smith, as well as the local elected and school officials took part in the campaign by getting their photo taken at the City Hall Court Room.\n\nJason Beckett is a marketing and brand developer who has created and managed multimillion-dollar campaigns for authors, manufactures, gurus, and corporations across the United States. He was the Director of Original Programming for Turner Media, writer/producer for Dream Big Productions, and programming developer for Primedia.\n\nBeckett created the I Am Equal project and built the record-breaking I Am Equal Photo Documentary with Matt Spencer as a way to highlight and showcase the unique human rights and social issues that unite the human family.\n\nTo further support the photo documentary project and associated foundation, Beckett also produced the 'Live For Love' Charity mini album and donated all the proceeds to the campaign. The album includes the original songs Live For Love and Will You Stand By, along with a cover of the Elton John classic, 'The Last Song.'\n\nMatt Spencer is a commercial fashion photographer who works with Fortune 500 companies and various international publications. Publications including Women’s Fitness Magazine, Seventeen Magazine, V.I.P. Zone, M the Book, Launchpad Magazine, PDN have featured his work. Some campaign members have said that his photographic style become as recognizable as the campaign logo itself.\n\nAfter collecting nearly 500 photos in the testing phase of the documentary project, organizers began planning the first \"official\" tour event in Sacramento, California, with the help of former NBA All Star and current Sacramento City Mayor, Kevin Johnson. Working closely with his entire staff, the details were set in place to open the official I Am Equal Photo Documentary world tour at The Citizen Hotel, across the street from City Hall and the California State Capital. The documentary creators have said that they intend to visit between 20 and 25 cities each year for at least 7 years in order to collect their target goal of more than 100,000 individual photos.\n\n"}
{"id": "416005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416005", "title": "Indeterminism", "text": "Indeterminism\n\nIndeterminism is the idea that events (or certain events, or events of certain types) are not caused, or not caused deterministically.\n\nIt is the opposite of determinism and related to chance. It is highly relevant to the philosophical problem of free will, particularly in the form of metaphysical libertarianism. In science, most specifically quantum theory in physics, indeterminism is the belief that no event is certain and the entire outcome of anything is probabilistic. The Heisenberg uncertainty relations and the \"Born rule\", proposed by Max Born, are often starting points in support of the indeterministic nature of the universe. Indeterminism is also asserted by Sir Arthur Eddington, and Murray Gell-Mann. Indeterminism has been promoted by the French biologist Jacques Monod's essay \"Chance and Necessity\".\nThe physicist-chemist Ilya Prigogine argued for indeterminism in complex systems.\nIndeterminists do not have to deny that causes exist. Instead, they can maintain that the only causes that exist are of a type that do not constrain the future to a single course; for instance, they can maintain that only necessary and not sufficient causes exist. The necessary/sufficient distinction works as follows:\n\nIf \"x\" is a necessary cause of \"y\"; then the presence of \"y\" necessarily implies that \"x\" preceded it. The presence of \"x\", however, does not imply that \"y\" will occur.\n\nIf \"x\" is a sufficient cause of \"y\", then the presence of \"x\" necessarily implies the presence of \"y\". (However, another cause \"z\" may alternatively cause \"y\". Thus the presence of \"y\" does not imply the presence of \"x\".)\n\nAs Daniel Dennett points out in \"Freedom Evolves\", it is possible for everything to have a necessary cause, even while indeterminism holds and the future is open, because a necessary condition does not lead to a single inevitable effect. Thus \"everything has a cause\" is, in his opinion, not a clear statement of determinism. Still, a question might arise why this and not that effect occurred: as long as a cause (something in the past) determines the answer to the question \"effect A or B\" (or \"why\" A or B), determinism will hold. On this basis \"everything has a cause\" might still be understood as an expression of determinism.\n\nInterpreting causation as a deterministic relation means that if \"A\" causes \"B\", then \"A\" must always be followed by \"B\". In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does smoking cause cancer. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation. Informally, \"A\" probabilistically causes \"B\" if \"A\"'s occurrence increases the probability of \"B\". This is sometimes interpreted to reflect the imperfect knowledge of a deterministic system but other times interpreted to mean that the causal system under study has an inherently indeterministic nature. (Propensity probability is an analogous idea, according to which probabilities have an objective existence and are not just limitations in a subject's knowledge).\n\nIt can be proved that realizations of any probability distribution other than the uniform one are mathematically equal to applying a (deterministic) function (namely, an inverse distribution function) on a random variable following the latter (i.e. an \"absolutely random\" one); the probabilities are contained in the deterministic element. A simple form of demonstrating it would be shooting randomly within a square and then (deterministically) interpreting a relatively large subsquare as the more probable outcome.\n\nA distinction is generally made between indeterminism and the mere inability to measure the variables (limits of precision). This is especially the case for physical indeterminism (as proposed by various interpretations of quantum mechanics). Yet some philosophers have argued that indeterminism and unpredictability are synonymous.\n\nOne of the important philosophical implications of determinism is that, according to incompatibilists, it undermines many versions of free will. Correspondingly, believers in free will\noften appeal to physical indeterminism. (See compatibilism for a third option.)\n\nThe first major philosopher to argue convincingly for some indeterminism was probably Aristotle. He described four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was αἰτίαι (\"aitiai\", as in \"aetiology\"), which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic \"every event has a (single) cause\" idea that was to come later.\n\nIn his \"Physics\" and \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle said there were accidents (συμβεβηκός, \"sumbebekos\") caused by nothing but chance (τύχη, \"tukhe\"). He noted that he and the early physicists found no place for chance among their causes.\n\nAristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:\n\nOne generation after Aristotle, Epicurus argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would \"swerve\" (\"clinamen\") from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused. For Epicurus, the occasional interventions of arbitrary gods would be preferable to strict determinism.\n\nThe first concept of \"chance\" is found in the Atomism of Leucippus, often confused with that of Democritus, though, in fact, the last studies show many differences between the two. The first assertion about chance is the Leucippus fragment that says:\n<br>\n<br>\"The cosmos, then, became like a spherical form in this way: the atoms being submitted to a casual and unpredictable movement, quickly and incessantly\".\n\nIn 1729 the\"Testament\" of Jean Meslier states:\n\n\"The matter, by virtue of its own active force, moves and acts in blind manner\". \n\nSoon after Julien Offroy de la Mettrie in his \"L'Homme Machine.\" (1748, anon.) wrote:\n\n\"Perhaps, the cause of man's existence is just in existence itself? Perhaps he is by chance thrown in some point of this terrestrial surface without any \"how\" and \"why\"\". \n\nIn his \"Anti-Sénèque\" [\"Traité de la vie heureuse, par Sénèque, avec un Discours du traducteur sur le même sujet\", 1750] we read:\n\n\"Then, the chance has thrown us in life\".\n\nIn the 19th century the French Philosopher Antoine-Augustin Cournot theorized \"chance\" in a new way, as series of not-linear causes. He wrote in \"Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances\" (1851):\n\n\"It is not because of rarity that the chance is actual. On the contrary, it is because of chance they produce many possible others.\" \n\nTychism ( \"chance\") is a thesis proposed by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in the 1890s. It holds that absolute chance, also called spontaneity, is a real factor operative in the universe. It may be considered both the direct opposite of Einstein's oft quoted dictum that: \"God does not play dice with the universe\" and an early philosophical anticipation of Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nPeirce does not, of course, assert that there is \"no\" law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.\nComplete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.\n\nKarl Popper comments that Peirce's theory received little contemporary attention, and that other philosophers did not adopt indeterminism until the rise of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn 1931, Arthur Holly Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox.\n\nReacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of our actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an \"Atlantic Monthly\" article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice.\n\nA set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be. These conditions, insofar as they can be known, define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur. When one exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to the person himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free.\nCompton welcomed the rise of indeterminism in 20th century science, writing:\nIn my own thinking on this vital subject I am in a much more satisfied state of mind than I could have been at any earlier stage of science. If the statements of the laws of physics were assumed correct, one would have had to suppose (as did most philosophers) that the feeling of freedom is illusory, or if [free] choice were considered effective, that the laws of physics ... [were] unreliable. The dilemma has been an uncomfortable one.\nTogether with Arthur Eddington in Britain, Compton was one of those rare distinguished physicists in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s arguing for the “liberation of free will” with the help of Heisenberg’s indeterminacy principle, but their efforts had been met not only with physical and philosophical criticism but most primarily with fierce political and ideological campaigns. \n\nIn his essay \"Of Clouds and Cuckoos\", included in his book \"Objective Knowledge\", Popper\ncontrasted \"clouds\", his metaphor for indeterministic systems, with \"clocks\", meaning deterministic ones.\nHe sided with indeterminism, writing\n\nI believe Peirce was right in holding that all clocks are clouds to some considerable degree — even the most precise of clocks. This, I think, is the most important inversion of the mistaken determinist view that all clouds are clocks\nPopper was also a promoter of propensity probability.\n\nKane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on free will. Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles \"libertarian freedom\", Kane argues that \"(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)\". It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in \"ultimate responsibility\".\n\nWhat allows for ultimate responsibility of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as \"self-forming actions\" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that \"every\" act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.\n\nMark Balaguer, in his book \"Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem\" argues similarly to Kane. He believes that, conceptually, free will requires indeterminism, and the question of whether the brain behaves indeterministically is open to further empirical research. He has also written on this matter \"A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will\".\n\nIn probability theory, a stochastic process , or sometimes random process, is the counterpart to a deterministic process (or deterministic system). Instead of dealing with only one possible reality of how the process might evolve over time (as is the case, for example, for solutions of an ordinary differential equation), in a stochastic or random process there is some indeterminacy in its future evolution described by probability distributions. This means that even if the initial condition (or starting point) is known, there are many possibilities the process might go to, but some paths may be more probable and others less so.\n\nThe idea that Newtonian physics proved causal determinism was highly influential in the early modern period.\n\"Thus physical determinism [..] became the ruling faith among enlightened men; and everybody who did not embrace this new faith was held to be an obscurantist and a reactionary\". However: \"Newton himself may be counted among the few dissenters, for he regarded the solar system as \"imperfect\", and consequently as likely to perish\".\n\nClassical chaos is not usually considered an example of indeterminism, as it can occur in deterministic systems such as the three-body problem.\n\nJohn Earman has argued that most physical theories are indeterministic. For instance, Newtonian physics admits solutions where particles accelerate continuously, heading out towards infinity. By the time reversibility of the laws in question, particles could also head inwards, unprompted by any pre-existing state. He calls such hypothetical particles \"space invaders\".\n\nJohn D. Norton has suggested another indeterministic scenario, known as Norton's Dome, where a particle is initially situated on the exact apex of a dome.\n\nBranching space-time is a theory uniting indeterminism and the special theory of relativity. The idea was originated by Nuel Belnap. The equations of general relativity admit of both indeterministic and deterministic solutions.\n\nLudwig Boltzmann, was one of the founders of statistical mechanics and the modern atomic theory of matter. He is remembered for his discovery that the second law of thermodynamics is a statistical law stemming from disorder. He also speculated that the ordered universe we see is only a small bubble in much larger sea of chaos. The Boltzmann brain is a similar idea. He can be considered one of few indeterminists to embrace pure chance.\n\nDarwinian evolution has an enhanced reliance on the chance element of random mutation compared to the earlier evolutionary theory of Herbert Spencer. However, the question of whether evolution requires genuine ontological indeterminism is open to debate\n\nIn the essay \"Chance and Necessity\" (1970) Jacques Monod rejected the role of final causation in biology, instead arguing that a mixture of efficient causation and \"pure chance\" lead to teleonomy, or merely \"apparent\" purposefulness.\n\nThe Japanese theoretical population geneticist Motoo Kimura emphasises the role of indeterminism in evolution. According to neutral theory of molecular evolution: \"at the molecular level most evolutionary change is caused by random drift of gene mutants that are equivalent in the face of selection.\n\nIn his 1997 book, \"The End of Certainty\", Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief. \"The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism.\" This is a major departure from the approach of Newton, Einstein and Schrödinger, all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of irreversibility and instability.\n\nPrigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to Darwin, whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired Ludwig Boltzmann to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles. This led to the field of statistical mechanics and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the arrow of time. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the \"present,\" which follows a determined \"past\" and precedes an undetermined \"future.\" All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including diffusion, radioactive decay, solar radiation, weather and the emergence and evolution of life. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of probability.\n\nPrigogine asserts that Newtonian physics has now been \"extended\" three times, first with the use of the wave function in quantum mechanics, then with the introduction of spacetime in general relativity and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems.\n\nAt one time, it was assumed in the physical sciences that if the behavior observed in a system cannot be predicted, the problem is due to lack of fine-grained information, so that a sufficiently detailed investigation would eventually result in a deterministic theory (\"If you knew exactly all the forces acting on the dice, you would be able to predict which number comes up\").\n\nHowever, the advent of quantum mechanics removed the underpinning from that approach, with the claim that (at least according to the Copenhagen interpretation) the most basic constituents of matter at times behave indeterministically. This comes from the collapse of the wave function, in which the state of a system upon measurement cannot in general be predicted. Quantum mechanics only predicts the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are given by the Born rule. Non-deterministic behavior upon wave function collapse is not only a feature of the Copenhagen interpretation, with its observer-dependence, but also of objective collapse theories.\n\nOpponents of quantum indeterminism suggested that determinism could be restored by formulating a new theory in which additional information, so-called hidden variables\n, would allow definite outcomes to be determined. For instance, in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper titled \"Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\" arguing that such a theory was in fact necessary to preserve the principle of locality.\nIn 1964, John S. Bell was able to define a theoretical test for these local hidden variable theories, which was reformulated as a workable experimental test through the work of Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt. The negative result of the 1980s tests by Alain Aspect ruled such theories out, provided certain assumptions about the experiment hold. Thus any interpretation of quantum mechanics, including deterministic reformulations, must either reject locality or reject counterfactual definiteness altogether. David Bohm's theory is the main example of a non-local deterministic quantum theory.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is said to be deterministic, but experimental results still cannot be predicted: experimenters do not know which 'world' they will end up in. Technically, counterfactual definiteness is lacking.\n\nA notable consequence of quantum indeterminism is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which prevents the simultaneous accurate measurement of all a particle's properties.\n\nPrimordial fluctuations are density variations in the early universe which are considered the seeds of all structure in the universe. Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of cosmic inflation. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the scale factor during inflation caused quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the horizon, to \"freeze in\".\nAt the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the initial conditions for structure formation.\n\nNeuroscientists such as Bjoern Brembs and Christof Koch believe thermodynamically stochastic processes in the brain are the basis of free will, and that even very simple organisms such as flies have a form of free will. Similar ideas are put forward by some philosophers such as Robert Kane.\n\nDespite recognizing indeterminism to be a very low-level, necessary prerequisite, Bjoern Brembs says that it's not even close to being sufficient for addressing things like morality and responsibility. Edward O. Wilson does not extrapolate from bugs to people, and Corina E. Tarnita alerts against trying to draw parallels between people and insects, since human selflessness and cooperation, however, is of a different sort, also involving the interaction of culture and sentience, not just genetics and environment.\n\nAgainst Einstein and others who advocated determinism, indeterminism—as championed by the English astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington—says that a physical object has an ontologically undetermined component that is not due to the epistemological limitations of physicists' understanding. The uncertainty principle, then, would not necessarily be due to hidden variables but to an indeterminism in nature itself.\n\nDeterminism and indeterminism are examined in \"Causality and Chance in Modern Physics\" by David Bohm. He speculates that, since determinism can emerge from underlying indeterminism (via the law of large numbers), and that indeterminism can emerge from determinism (for instance, from classical chaos), the universe could be conceived of as having alternating layers of causality and chaos.\n\n\n"}

When such thoughts are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and sometimes attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the thoughts may become paralyzing, anxiety-provoking, or persistent. Intrusive thoughts may also be associated with episodic memory, unwanted worries or memories from OCD, posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or psychosis. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and generally have aggressive, sexual, or blasphemous themes.\n\nMany people experience the type of bad or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people can dismiss these thoughts. For most people, intrusive thoughts are a \"fleeting annoyance\". Psychologist Stanley Rachman presented a questionnaire to healthy college students and found that virtually all said they had these thoughts from time to time, including thoughts of sexual violence, sexual punishment, \"unnatural\" sex acts, painful sexual practices, blasphemous or obscene images, thoughts of harming elderly people or someone close to them, violence against animals or towards children, and impulsive or abusive outbursts or utterances. Such bad thoughts are universal among humans, and have \"almost certainly always been a part of the human condition\".\n\nWhen intrusive thoughts occur with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), patients are less able to ignore the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. The thoughts may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy. Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.\n\nHow people react to intrusive thoughts may determine whether these thoughts will become severe, turn into obsessions, or require treatment. Intrusive thoughts can occur with or without compulsions. Carrying out the compulsion reduces the anxiety, but makes the urge to perform the compulsion stronger each time it recurs, reinforcing the intrusive thoughts. According to Lee Baer, suppressing the thoughts only makes them stronger, and recognizing that bad thoughts do not signify that one is truly evil is one of the steps to overcoming them. There is evidence of the benefit of acceptance as an alternative to suppression of intrusive thoughts. A study showed that those instructed to suppress intrusive thoughts experienced more distress after suppression, while patients instructed to accept the bad thoughts experienced decreased discomfort. These results may be related to underlying cognitive processes involved in OCD. However, accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as \"the doubting sickness\"; the \"pathological doubt\" that accompanies OCD can make it harder for a person with OCD to distinguish \"normal\" intrusive thoughts as experienced by most people, causing them to \"suffer in silence, feeling too embarrassed or worried that they will be thought crazy\".\n\nThe possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low. Patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and upset over these thoughts are different from those who actually act on them. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts. Patients who are not troubled or shamed by their thoughts, do not find them distasteful, or who have actually taken action, might need to have more serious conditions such as psychosis or potentially criminal behaviors ruled out. According to Lee Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.\n\nIntrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves. They can be related to primarily obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder. These thoughts can include harming a child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including:\nThese thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin quality of life. Treatment is available when the thoughts are associated with OCD and become persistent, severe, or distressing.\n\nA variant of aggressive intrusive thoughts is L'appel du vide, or the call of the void. Sufferers of \"L'appel du vide\" generally describe the condition as manifesting in certain situations, normally as a wish or brief desire to jump from a high location.\n\nSexual obsession involve intrusive thoughts or images of \"kissing, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape\" with \"strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures\", involving \"heterosexual or homosexual content\" with persons of any age.\n\nLike other unwanted intrusive thoughts or images, everyone has some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing.\n\nOne of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her sexual identity. As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity.\n\nA person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, \"embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear of acting on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether they have already acted in such a way.\" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal. However, focusing attention of any part of the body can result in feelings in that part of the body, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges. Part of treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies. This arousal in the part of the body is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as \"sexually relevant\" and what the brain regards as \"sexually appealing\" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them. Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by \"forbidden\" images or simply discussing the matter which can then also cause physiological arousal, such as sweating, increased heart rate and some degree of tumescence or lubrication. This is often misinterpreted by the sufferer as an indication of desire or intent, when it is in fact not.\n\nBlasphemous thoughts are a common component of OCD, documented throughout history; notable religious figures such as Martin Luther and Ignatius of Loyola were known to be tormented by intrusive, blasphemous or religious thoughts and urges. Martin Luther had urges to curse God and Jesus, and was obsessed with images of \"the Devil's behind.\" St. Ignatius had numerous obsessions, including the fear of stepping on pieces of straw forming a cross, fearing that it showed disrespect to Christ. A study of 50 patients with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that 40% had religious and blasphemous thoughts and doubts—a higher, but not statistically significantly different number than the 38% who had the obsessional thoughts related to dirt and contamination more commonly associated with OCD. One study suggests that content of intrusive thoughts may vary depending on culture, and that blasphemous thoughts may be more common in men than in women.\n\nAccording to Fred Penzel, a New York psychologist, some common religious obsessions and intrusive thoughts are:\n\nSuffering can be greater and treatment complicated when intrusive thoughts involve religious implications; patients may believe the thoughts are inspired by Satan, and may fear punishment from God or have magnified shame because they perceive themselves as sinful. Symptoms can be more distressing for sufferers with strong religious convictions or beliefs.\n\nBaer believes that blasphemous thoughts are more common in Catholics and evangelical Protestants than in other religions, whereas Muslims tend to comply with the laws and rituals of their faith, and performing the rituals perfectly. He hypothesizes that this is because what is considered inappropriate varies among cultures and religions, and intrusive thoughts torment their sufferers with whatever is considered most inappropriate in the surrounding culture.\n\nIntrusive thoughts are associated with OCD or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, but may also occur with other conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, clinical depression, postpartum depression, and anxiety. One of these conditions is almost always present in people whose intrusive thoughts reach a clinical level of severity. A large study published in 2005 found that aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions were broadly associated with comorbid anxiety disorders and depression. The intrusive thoughts that occur in a schizophrenic episode differ from the obsessional thoughts that occur with OCD or depression in that the intrusive thoughts of schizophrenics are false or delusional beliefs (i.e. held by the schizophrenic individual to be real and not doubted, as is typically the case with intrusive thoughts) .\n\nThe key difference between OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is that the intrusive thoughts of PTSD sufferers are of traumatic events that actually happened to them, whereas OCD sufferers have thoughts of imagined catastrophes. PTSD patients with intrusive thoughts have to sort out violent, sexual, or blasphemous thoughts from memories of traumatic experiences. When patients with intrusive thoughts do not respond to treatment, physicians may suspect past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.\n\nPeople who are clinically depressed may experience intrusive thoughts more intensely, and view them as evidence that they are worthless or sinful people. The suicidal thoughts that are common in depression must be distinguished from intrusive thoughts, because suicidal thoughts—unlike harmless sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts—can be dangerous.\n\nUnwanted thoughts by mothers about harming infants are common in postpartum depression. A 1999 study of 65 women with postpartum major depression by Katherine Wisner \"et al.\" found the most frequent aggressive thought for women with postpartum depression was causing harm to their newborn infants. A study of 85 new parents found that 89% experienced intrusive images, for example, of the baby suffocating, having an accident, being harmed, or being kidnapped.\n\nSome women may develop symptoms of OCD during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Postpartum OCD occurs mainly in women who may already have OCD, perhaps in a mild or undiagnosed form. Postpartum depression and OCD may be comorbid (often occurring together). And though physicians may focus more on the depressive symptoms, one study found that obsessive thoughts did accompany postpartum depression in 57% of new mothers.\n\nWisner found common obsessions about harming babies in mothers experiencing postpartum depression include images of the baby lying dead in a casket or being eaten by sharks; stabbing the baby; throwing the baby down the stairs; or drowning or burning the baby (as by submerging it in the bathtub in the former case or throwing it in the fire or putting it in the microwave in the latter). Baer estimates that up to 200,000 new mothers with postpartum depression each year may develop these obsessional thoughts about their babies; and because they may be reluctant to share these thoughts with a physician or family member, or suffer in silence and fear they are \"crazy\", their depression can worsen.\n\nIntrusive fears of harming immediate children can last longer than the postpartum period. A study of 100 clinically depressed women found that 41% had obsessive fears that they might harm their child, and some were afraid to care for their children. Among non-depressed mothers, the study found 7% had thoughts of harming their child—a rate that yields an additional 280,000 non-depressed mothers in the United States with intrusive thoughts about harming their children.\n\nTreatment for intrusive thoughts is similar to treatment for OCD. Exposure and response prevention therapy—also referred to as habituation or desensitization—is useful in treating intrusive thoughts. Mild cases can also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps patients identify and manage the unwanted thoughts.\n\nExposure therapy is the treatment of choice for intrusive thoughts. According to Deborah Osgood-Hynes, Psy.D. Director of Psychological Services and Training at the MGH/McLean OCD Institute, \"In order to reduce a fear, you have to face a fear. This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD.\" Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish. By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement—the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions. When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.\n\nExposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety-provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes. The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts. This is the most effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of the intrusive thoughts. The goal is to be able to \"expose yourself to the thing that most triggers your fear or discomfort for one to two hours at a time, without leaving the situation, or doing anything else to distract or comfort you.\" Exposure therapy will not completely eliminate intrusive thoughts—everyone has bad thoughts—but most patients find that it can decrease their thoughts sufficiently that intrusive thoughts no longer interfere with their lives.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a newer therapy than exposure therapy, available for those unable or unwilling to undergo exposure therapy. Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts, but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important.\n\nAntidepressants or antipsychotic medications may be used for more severe cases if intrusive thoughts do not respond to cognitive behavioral or exposure therapy alone. Whether the cause of intrusive thoughts is OCD, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs (a class of antidepressants) are the most commonly prescribed. Intrusive thoughts may occur in persons with Tourette syndrome (TS) who also have OCD; the obsessions in TS-related OCD are thought to respond to SSRI drugs as well.\n\nAntidepressants which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD include fluvoxamine (trade name Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and clomipramine (Anafranil). Although SSRIs are known to be effective for OCD in general, there have been fewer studies on their effectiveness for intrusive thoughts. A retrospective chart review of patients with sexual symptoms treated with SSRIs showed the greatest improvement was in those with intrusive sexual obsessions typical of OCD. A study of ten patients with religious or blasphemous obsessions found that most patients responded to treatment with fluoxetine or clomipramine. Women with postpartum depression often have anxiety as well, and may need lower starting doses of SSRIs; they may not respond fully to the medication, and may benefit from adding cognitive behavioral or response prevention therapy.\n\nPatients with intense intrusive thoughts that do not respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), and pimozide (Orap).\n\nStudies suggest that therapeutic doses of inositol may be useful in the treatment of obsessive thoughts.\n\nA 2007 study found that 78% of a clinical sample of OCD patients had intrusive images. Most people who suffer from intrusive thoughts have not identified themselves as having OCD, because they may not have what they believe to be classic symptoms of OCD, such as handwashing. Yet, epidemiological studies suggest that intrusive thoughts are the most common kind of OCD worldwide; if people in the United States with intrusive thoughts gathered, they would form the fourth-largest city in the US, following New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nThe prevalence of OCD in every culture studied is at least 2% of the population, and the majority of those have obsessions, or bad thoughts, only; this results in a conservative estimate of more than 2 million sufferers in the United States alone (as of 2000). One author estimates that one in 50 adults have OCD and about 10–20% of these have sexual obsessions. A recent study found that 25% of 293 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD had a history of sexual obsessions.\n\n\n\n"}

The survey revealed a number of problems: Ukrainian legislation didn’t allow women to be assigned to combat positions, so they were enlisted as cooks, seamstresses, cleaners, accountants etc. while taking part in military combat operations as snipers, grenade launcher operators, reconnaissance soldiers, artillerists etc. This was done on semi-legal grounds. Thus, the majority of women who served in the war in Donbass were not enlisted officially and subsequently had no access to social or military benefits, military awards, social status, or career opportunities in the Armed Forces. \nWith the support of Ukrainian Women's Fund and UN Women, the \"Invisible Battalion\" survey turned into an ambitious photo project: about half a hundred portraits of Ukrainian women combatants were shot and exhibited at the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nIn 2016 the Invisible Battalion year calendar won the Grand Prix at the National Festival of Social Advertising. \n\nLater on, the Invisible Battalion social project turned into a full-length documentary Invisible Battalion: six stories of six women who were (or are) combatants at war in the East of Ukraine. Three women directors–Iryna Tsilyk, Alina Gorlova, and Svitlana Lischynska–offer female perspectives on war that are bluntly honest.

{"id": "928652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=928652", "title": "Licking", "text": "Licking\n\nLicking is the action of passing the tongue over a surface, typically either to deposit saliva onto the surface, or to collect liquid, food or minerals onto the tongue for ingestion, or to communicate with other animals. Many animals both groom themselves and eat or drink by licking.\n\nGrooming: Animals commonly clean themselves through licking. In mammals, licking helps keep the fur clean and untangled. The tongues of many mammals have a rough upper surface that acts like a brush when the animal licks its fur. Certain reptiles, such as geckos, clean their eyes by licking them.\n\nMammals typically lick their offspring clean immediately after birth; in many species this is necessary to free the newborn from the amniotic sac. The licking not only cleans and dries the offspring's fur, but also stimulates its breathing and digestive processes.\nFood and water acquisition: Hummingbirds are often said to \"sip\" nectar, but in fact they up nectar on their long tongues. Their tongues have fringed edges, which help both in nectar-eating and in catching tiny insects. Mother hummingbirds also lick their chicks after a rainstorm to dry them by licking water droplets from the coats of the chicks to avoid them chilling. Many animals drink by licking. While young mammals drink milk from their mothers' teats by sucking, the typical method of drinking for adult mammals involves dipping the tongue repeatedly into water and using it to scoop water into the mouth. This method of drinking relies in part on the water adhering to the surface of the tongue and in part on muscular control of the tongue to form it into a spoonlike shape. Cattle, horses and other animals lick rocks, salt licks or other objects to obtain mineral nutrients.\n\nGustation: Animals also use their tongues to enhance their sense of smell. By licking a surface or extending the tongue beyond the mouth, molecules are transferred via the tongue to the olfactory receptors in the nose and in some animals, to the vomeronasal organ. In some mammals, the tongue is used to \"lick\" the air during the flehmen response to assist transfer of pheremones. Similarly, snakes use smell to track their prey. They smell by using their forked tongues to collect airborne particles, then passing them to the vomeronasal organ. They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. \nCommunication: Dogs and cats use licking both to clean and to show affection among themselves or to humans, typically licking their faces. Many animals use licking as a submissive or appeasement signal in dominance hierarchies.\n\nThermoregulation: Some animals use licking to cool themselves. Cats do not sweat the way humans do and the saliva deposited by licking provides a similar means of evaporative cooling. Some animals spread saliva over areas of the body with little or no fur to maximise heat loss. For example, kangaroos lick their wrists and rats lick their testicles.\n\nMating behavior:\nPost-copulatory genital grooming often occurs in male rats and prosimian primates. This behavior may prevent disease transmission.\n\nRing-tailed lemurs lick each other's babies as a means of collective grooming and of reinforcing social cohesion within the community. Macaques and other primates lick leaves for water in addition to dipping their arms into tree crevices and licking the water off. Chimpanzees use licking in a variety of ways: licking objects, such as dead trees, that others in their community have licked, licking each other's body parts for grooming and sex and licking rocks for salt. Gorillas use licking in addition to other senses to determine the nature of an object.\n\nCompared to most other mammals, licking has a minor role for humans. The human tongue is relatively short and inflexible, and is not well adapted for either grooming or drinking. Instead, humans prefer to wash themselves using their hands and drink by sucking fluid into their mouth. Humans have much less hair over their skin than most other mammals, and much of that hair is in places which they cannot reach with their own mouth. The presence of sweat glands all over the human body makes licking as a cooling method unnecessary.\n\nNonetheless, licking does play a role for humans. Even though humans cannot effectively drink water by licking, the human tongue is quite sufficient for licking more viscous fluids. Some foods are sold in a form intended to be consumed mainly by licking, e.g. ice cream cones and lollipops.\n\nSome people in the Afar tribe of Ethiopia have been reported to have used their tongues to lick other humans, as a way of cleaning them from the dust that accumulates on them in a very water-scarce region.\n\nHumans use licking for a number of other purposes. For example, licking can moisten the adhesive surfaces of stamps or envelopes. Many people lick a fingertip (usually the one of the index finger) for some extra grip when turning a page, taking a sheet of paper from the top of a pile or opening a plastic bag. In sewing, thread ends are commonly wet by licking to make the fibres stick together and thus make threading them through the eye of a needle easier. Another practice considered uncivilized is licking one's hand and using it to groom one's hair.\n\nHumans also use their tongues for sexual purposes, such as during cunnilingus, anilingus, foot licking, and whilst French kissing, where two people lick each other's tongues.\n\nSelf-licking can sometimes become abnormally frequent occasionally resulting in a lick granuloma. The most common cause of lick granuloma appears to be psychological, related to stress, anxiety, separation anxiety, boredom, or compulsiveness. Lick granulomae are especially seen in active dogs left alone for long periods of time. One theory is that excessive licking causes endorphin release, which reduces pain and makes the dog feel temporarily euphoric. This provides the animal with positive feedback from the licking, and subsequent addiction to the behaviour.\n\nAnimals in captivity sometimes develop a licking stereotypy during which surfaces (walls, bars, gates, etc.) are repeatedly licked for no apparent reason. This has been observed in captive giraffes and camels.\n\nOn May 4th, 2018 during the Conference Semi-finals of the 2018 NHL Playoffs, Boston Bruins left winger, Brad Marchand used a full lick of the facial area as a defensive tactic against Ryan Callahan, right winger for the Tampa Bay Lighting. Although it was an aggressive attempt by the Boston forward, the Tampa Bay Lightning ultimately went on to win the game by a score of 4-3 in overtime to take a 3-1 series lead before heading back to Tampa Bay.\n\n"}

The metre and kilogram system served as the basis for the development of the International System of Units, which now serves as the international standard. Because of this, the standards of the CGS system were gradually replaced with metric standards incorporated from the MKS system.\n\nAn advantage of MKS units is that since the derived units (like joules) are based on MKS units, using MKS units naturally gives answers in the appropriate SI unit. For example, the kinetic energy of an object is defined by . If the calculation is done in MKS units of kilogram and meters per second then the result is in joules, the SI unit for energy. If the same calculation is done using CGS units the answer is in ergs ().\n\nThe exact list of units used in the MKS system changed over time. It incorporated base units other than the metre, kilogram, and second in addition to derived units. An incomplete list of the base and derived units appears below. Since the MKS system of units never had a governing body to rule on a standard definition, the list of units depended on different conventions at different times.\n\n\nIn 1901, Giovanni Giorgi proposed to the (AEI) that this system, extended with a fourth unit to be taken from the units of electromagnetism, be used as an international system. \nThis system was strongly promoted by electrical engineer George A. Campbell.\n\n\n"}

John Wallis invokes the name as the title to a textbook on Cartesian geometry. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a calculus ratiocinator.\n\nDescartes' clearest description of the \"mathesis universalis\" occurs in Rule IV of the Rules for the Direction of the Mind, written before 1628. The desire for a language more perfect than any natural language had been expressed before Leibniz by John Wilkins in his \"An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\" in 1668. Leibniz attempts to work out the possible connections between algebra, infinitesimal calculus, and universal character in an incomplete treatise titled \"Mathesis Universalis\" in 1695.\n\nPredicate logic could be seen as a modern system with some of these \"universal\" characteristics, at least as far as mathematics and computer science are concerned. More generally, \"mathesis universalis\", along with perhaps François Viète's algebra, represents one of the earliest attempts to construct a formal system.\n\nOne of the perhaps most prominent critics of the idea of \"mathesis universalis\" was Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophy of mathematics. As Anthropologist Prof. Emily Martin notes: 'Tackling mathematics, the realm of symbolic life perhaps most difficult to regard as contingent on social norms, Wittgenstein commented that people found the idea that numbers rested on conventional social understandings \"unbearable\"'\n\n\n"}

A moral agent is \"a being who is capable of acting with reference to right and wrong.\"\n\nMost philosophers suggest only rational beings, who can reason and form self-interested judgments, are capable of being moral agents. Some suggest those with limited rationality (for example, people who are mildly mentally disabled or infants) also have some basic moral capabilities.\n\nDeterminists argue all of our actions are the product of antecedent causes, and some believe this is incompatible with free will and thus claim that we have no real control over our actions. Immanuel Kant argued that whether or not our real self, the noumenal self, can choose, we have no choice but to believe that we choose freely when we make a choice. This does not mean that we can \"control\" the effects of our actions.\nSome Indeterminists would argue we have no free will either. If, with respect to human behaviour, a so-called 'cause' results in an indeterminate number of possible, so-called 'effects', that does not mean the person had the free-thinking independent will to choose that 'effect'. More likely, it was the indeterminate consequence of his chance genetics, chance experiences and chance circumstances relevant at the time of the 'cause'.\n\nIn Kant's philosophy, this calls for an act of faith, the faith free agent is based on something \"a priori\", yet to be known, or immaterial. Otherwise, without free agent's \"a priori\" fundamental source, socially essential concepts created from human mind, such as justice, would be undermined (responsibility implies freedom of choice) and, in short, civilization and human values would crumble.\n\nIt is useful to compare the idea of moral agency with the legal doctrine of \"mens rea\", which means guilty mind, and states that a person is legally responsible for what he does as long as he \"should\" know what he is doing, and his choices are deliberate. Some theorists discard any attempts to evaluate mental states and, instead, adopt the doctrine of \"strict liability\", whereby one is liable under the law without regard to capacity, and that the only thing is to determine the degree of punishment, if any. Moral determinists would most likely adopt a similar point of view.\n\nPsychologist Albert Bandura has observed that moral agents engage in selective moral disengagement in regards to their own inhumane conduct.\n\nMany philosophers, such as Kant, view morality as a transaction among rational parties, i.e., among moral agents. For this reason, they would exclude other animals from moral consideration. Others, such as Utilitarian philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer have argued the key to inclusion in the moral community is not rationality — for if it were, we might have to exclude some disabled people and infants, and might also have to distinguish between the degrees of rationality of healthy adults — but the real object of moral action is the avoidance of suffering. This is the argument from marginal cases.\n\nThe term artificial moral agent has taken on two usages. The first is in debates on whether it is possible for an artificial system to be a moral agent - see artificial systems and moral responsibility.\nThe second usage stems from efforts to construct machines with ethically-significant behaviors - see machine ethics. \nThe proper distinction between these two usages has itself been a key point of debate.\n\n"}

For example, a woman may adopt a kind, nurturing personality when dealing with her children but change to a more aggressive, forceful personality when going to work as a high-flying executive as her responsibilities change.\n\nRita Carter says evidence for multiplicity abounds and is found in history, and that when an individual states that they have been taken over by a spirit, soul, or ghost, they are saying that they are experiencing another personality. She says that feeling happy and carefree while in the company of your friends, but less so at home with family, is an example of multiple personality styles.\n\nJung proposed: \"The many \"contains\" the unity of the one \"without losing\" the possibilities of the many.\"\n\nPlato described the soul (\"psyche\") as having three parts, calling them Logos (rationality), Eros (erotic love), and Thymus (desire). According to Carter, Shakespeare showed examples of this in his works of literature; characters like Hamlet and Macbeth had distinct personalities that differed throughout their respective works. Carter says that Freud supported the notion of different personalities when he came up with the Id, Ego, and Superego, arguing that there is a split in the conscious and unconscious mind.\n\nCarter says that Italian psychologist Roberto Assagioli developed an approach to psychology called psychosynthesis, and thought many personalities that an individual is not consciously aware of may be present. American psychologist John G. Watkins used hypnosis to bring out different personalities, as a method to study those personalities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1749997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1749997", "title": "Norm of reciprocity", "text": "Norm of reciprocity\n\nThe norm of reciprocity requires that we repay in kind what another has done for us. It can be understood as the expectation that people will respond favorably to each other by returning benefits for benefits, and responding with either indifference or hostility to harms. The social norm of reciprocity often takes different forms in different areas of social life, or in different societies. All of them, however, are distinct from related ideas such as gratitude, the Golden Rule, or mutual goodwill. See reciprocity (social and political philosophy) for an analysis of the concepts involved. The norm of reciprocity mirrors the concept of reciprocal altruism in evolutionary biology. However, evolutionary theory and therefore sociobiology was not well received by mainstream psychologists. This led to the revitalisation of reciprocal altruism underneath the new social psychological concept, norm of reciprocity. Reciprocal altruism has been applied to various species, including humans, while mainstream psychologists use the norm of reciprocity to only explain humans.\n\nAn underlying norm of reciprocity is by itself a powerful engine for motivating, creating, sustaining, and regulating the cooperative behavior required for self-sustaining social organizations, controlling the damage done by the unscrupulous, and contributing to social system stability. See the discussions in tit for tat and reciprocity (social psychology). The power and ubiquity of the norm of reciprocity can be used against the unwary, however, and is the basis for the success of many malicious confidence games. Minor, usually less malicious examples are techniques used in advertising and other propaganda whereby a small gift of some kind is proffered with the expectation of producing a desire on the part of the recipient to reciprocate in some way, for example by purchasing a product, making a donation, or becoming more receptive to a line of argument. These minor examples include gifts of stickers and pens distributed by charities and flowers handed out by members of the Hare Krishna group.\n\nTwo key elements of the norm of reciprocity are positive and negative aspects to the term.\n\nA positive norm of reciprocity is \"the embedded obligations created by exchanges of benefits or favours among individuals. The recipient feels indebted to the favour or benefit giver until he/she repays\" (Chen, 2009). The positive reciprocity norm is a common social expectation where a person who helps another person can expect positive feedback whether it's in the form of a gift, a compliment, a loan, a job reference, etc. In social psychology, positive reciprocity refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action (rewarding kind actions). This norm is so powerful, it allows the initial giver to ask for something in return for what was given rather than having to wait for a voluntary reciprocal act. In some cases, a person does not have to ask for the other person to return a favour because it's already implied. Reciprocity also works at the level of liking; We like people who help us, and dislike those who ask for help but never return it. Disapproval is often enough to make people comply with norm of reciprocity.\n\n\"A negative norm of reciprocity represents the means by which individuals act against unfavourable treatments, and functions to keep balance in social systems\" (Chen, 2009). In contrast to the positive reciprocity norm', the negative reciprocity norm emphasizes the return of unfavourable treatment as an appropriate response to a misdeed. The principle of this norm serves as a powerful deterrent for violent or symbolic mistreatment in society. Harming others invites anger and revenge, therefore people receiving negative treatment are likely to retaliate in an angry manner. Studies have shown, that individuals with a propensity towards anger might more strongly endorse the negative reciprocity norm as a justification for consummating their hostility by punishing the instigator of mistreatment (Eisenberger, Lynch, Aselage and Rohdiek 2004).[1] Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson (2002)[2] found that most college students believe that criminal punishment should be determined by the seriousness of the crime rather than by punishment's effectiveness in preventing similar crimes.\n\nThere are also contrasting ideas when it comes to the differentiation of negative and positive norms of reciprocity. \"In contrast to a positive norm of reciprocity Gouldner (1960) also suggested a negative norm of reciprocity or sentiments of retaliation where the emphasis is placed not on the return of benefits but on the return of injuries\" (Chen, 2009). So there is a slight grey line between what could be considered a positive norm and a negative norm. But both of these reciprocity norms are mechanisms adapted by humans in order to keep a balance among man kind. \"Accordingly, both positive and negative norms or reciprocity serve as starting mechanisms as well as stabilizing functions in theta they help initiate and maintain equitable interpersonal exchanges in human evolution\" (Chen, 2009).\n\nThe norm of reciprocity is usually internalised. All major ethical and religious traditions include reciprocity as a primary rule of moral behaviour – from Jesus (“As you would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” to Confucius (“What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.”). The moral character of the norm may encourage the sense that following it is an imperative rather than a choice, and failing to reciprocate should create feelings of self-reproach and guilt.\n\nAnother way to understand how the norm or reciprocity works is to understand that the initial favour and the following repayment always unfolds in a public way. The social rewards of sticking to the norm and the costs of breaching it are profound. People deny continued group membership to others who conveniently breach the norm.\n\nThe norm of reciprocity stipulates that the amount of the return to a favour is “roughly the same” as what had been received. Such idea of equivalence takes two forms;\n\nHowever, Mark A. Whatley and colleagues (1999) found that people will give more favors, like a higher donation, if it is a public condition.\n\nFavours given are not immediately repaid and returning of favours may take a long time. Such intervening time period is governed by the norm of reciprocity in two manners. First, the stakeholder is assembling, mobilizing, liquidating resources or assets so as to make a suitable repayment. Second, it is a time period that the relevant party should not do harm to people who have given them benefits; people are morally constrained to demonstrate gratitude towards or maintain peace with their benefactors. As such, outstanding obligations can thus contribute to the stabilising of social systems by encouraging mutually beneficial exchange and cooperative behaviours.\n\nThe only \"rough equivalence\" of repayment aforementioned then suggests an important system-stabilising functions. It introduces an element of ambiguity as to whether the indebtedness has been repaid fully, thus creating uncertainty on who the indebted parties are. The comparative indeterminancy then serves as a type of all-purpose moral cement; it keeps us mindful of our behaviours and induces cooperative action.\n\nThe norm of reciprocity also contributes to social stability even when there is a well-developed system of specific status duties; status duties shape behavior as the status occupant believe them binding in their own right; they are expected to faithfully fulfill their responsibilities. Nonetheless, the general norm of reciprocity offers another source of motivation and moral sanction for conforming with specific status obligations; if other people have been fulfilling their status responsibilities to you, you then have a second-order obligation to fulfill your status responsibilities to them as well. The feeling of gratitude reinforces that of rectitude and contributes to conformity, thus social stability.\n\nPerceived organizational support (POS) and perceived psychological contract violation (PPCV) are the two most common measures of the reciprocity norm in organizational research. POS is the degree to which employees’ believe that their organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being. POS is generally thought to be the organization’s contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to pay back POS. PPCV is a construct that regards employees’ feelings of disappointment (ranging from minor frustration to betrayal) arising from their belief that their organization has broken its work-related promises, is generally thought to be the organization’s contribution to a negative reciprocity dynamic, as employees tend to perform more poorly to pay back PPCV.\n\nDavid R. Hekman and colleagues found that professional employees, such as doctors and lawyers, are most likely to repay POS with better performance when they have high levels of organizational identification combined with low levels of professional identification. Professional employees are most forgiving of PPCV when they have high levels of organizational identification combined with low levels of professional identification.\n\nThe norms of reciprocity in interactions among employees underlie Adam Grant's distinction between \"giver cultures\" and \"taker cultures\" as two end-points of a scale, with \"matcher cultures\" in between.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists have used the norm of reciprocity to explain altruism by emphasizing our expectations that “helping others will increase the likelihood that they will help us in the future.” The underlying justification lies in the human desire to reciprocate kindness and cooperate for survival value has enabled our continued existence in a hostile world. Thus, the norm of reciprocity ultimately has survival value. Furthermore, being as this sentiment is intrinsic to our evolutionary history and existence, adherence to the norm would constitute “natural” behavior whose neglect might necessarily cause a degree of dissonance in an individual who, among many other self-concepts, consciously labels himself a human being, perhaps leading to a reduction in self-esteem. The norm of reciprocity is reciprocal altruism, a concept coined by the evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers. However, the rise of sociobiology was not well received by mainstream psychologists. It is therefore not surprising that the stigma of the evolutionary theory led reciprocal altruism to be revitalised underneath the name \"norm of reciprocity\". The norm of reciprocity is arguably less scientifically advanced than reciprocal altruism, due to the degree of research underneath the name \"reciprocal altruism\" as opposed to the name \"norm of reciprocity\".\n\nDevelopmental psychologists have studied the norm of reciprocity and the development of this norm in children. Psychologists have found that children begin to show the reciprocal behavior around the age of two, when they observe the behavior of others and begin to have their own relationships with peers. One way that psychologists have been able to study the norm of reciprocity in children is by observing and experimenting on their toy sharing behaviour. Kristina R. Olson and Elizabeth S. Spelke (2007) conducted an experiment is which they used dolls to represent family members and friends and gave the child various items to distribute to the dolls after a series of situations were explained to the child. These situations represented private and public reciprocity and gave the child the choice of which dolls to share the items with. An example of a situation involves one of the dolls sharing with the rest of them. Olson and Spelke found that children will give to family and friends more than strangers, repay those who shared with them, and reward those who share with others, even if they do not receive the item.\n\nPsychologists Ken J. Rotenberg and Luanne Mann have also explored the development of the reciprocity norm of self-disclosure and its functions in children’s attraction to peers. The findings have indicated that the norm of the reciprocity is involved in attraction to peers only by six-grade; children of this year group showed such effect by reporting greater affection towards others who reciprocated the same amount of intimacy than those whose intimacy level deviated from the initiator’s. According to Youniss's (1980) theory of social development, children's friendship during the early part of middle childhood (5–8 years) is based upon the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a \"tit-for-tat\" rule of exchange and interaction. During the later part of middle childhood (9–11 years) and beyond, children's friendship is based on the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a mutually cooperative principle of exchange as well as an appreciation of reciprocity.\n\nA study was done in 2000 that consisted of 116 MBA students enrolled in a part-time MBA program at a business school, in the north east of the United States (Chen, 2009). The study consisted of two parts, the first part was to complete a series of self perception questions, which included the measure of the relational-self orientation (Chen, 2009). The second part was to complete a work relationship exercise during a class session 6 weeks later than the first task. \"In the exercise, participants\nread a vignette in which they were asked to imagine that they were the focal person in a reward allocation scenario at work\" (Chen, 2009). They were then told that they worked hard on the project together with a colleague, and made the same sort of effort and contribution to the project. Their supervisor then agreed to give $1000 reward. They were then given the following options on how to divide the money: \n(A) Your colleague will make a proposal as to how the money should be divided.\n(B) If you accept the proposal, then you will get what the colleague proposed to you. However, if you reject it, then the\nmoney will return to the company for future reward considerations. \nMeasures were calculated on how many people would reject the proposal or accept the proposal. And the results were positively and negatively skewed. If the two persons were close friends or colleagues the acceptance rate was 62% if the offer was 20% of the 1000 dollars, and 100% if the offer was 80% of the money (Chen, 2009). If the colleagues were distant then the rates were 20% for 20% of the money and 77% for 80% of the money (Chen, 2009).\n\n"}

The agency can be found in twelve regional offices and in its Washington, D.C. headquarters.

When announcing the schools under investigation, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon suggested that \"increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue... and foster better public awareness of civil rights.\"\n\nThe decision to release the names of universities and colleges under investigation was due to pressure from both the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the New Campus Anti-Rape Movement. Importantly, Lhamon continued, \"a college or university's appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law.\"\n\nThere are critics of the list on both sides of campus anti-rape politics. Andrea Pino, a complainant against UNC-Chapel Hill and co-founder of End Rape on Campus, told the Huffington Post that \"announcing an investigation can open survivors to retaliation, and it's important that the OCR also take emphasis on providing survivors an option to opt out of having their investigation announced if it could endanger them, especially in small institutions where anonymity is less of an option.\" Organizations like FIRE have argued that the OCR list—along with its precursor the Dear colleague letter—violates the rights to due process for both institutions and individuals.\n\nOn July 2, 2014, the Office for Civil Rights added 12 colleges and universities to its list, on July 10, 2014 one more was added, and four more were named on July 30, 2014.\n\nIn November 2014, the Office for Civil Rights announced that it had found Princeton University in violation of Title IX.

{"id": "42999230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42999230", "title": "Open justice", "text": "Open justice\n\nOpen justice is a legal principle describing legal processes characterized by openness and transparency. The term has particular emphasis in legal systems based on British law, such as in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries such as South Africa and Canada and Australia, and former British colonies such as the United States. The term has several closely related meanings: it is seen as a fundamental right guaranteeing liberty; it describes guidelines for how courts can be more transparent; and it sometimes identifies an ideal situation. In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time, televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing, publishing the content and documents of court files, providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format, publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens. The principle includes efforts to try to make what happens in the court understandable to the public and the press.\n\nIn Canada, open justice is referred to as the open court principle.\n\nThe principle is viewed as an underlying or core principle in British law. It has a long history dating back hundreds of years, and it has been traced to decisions made before the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. Today the concept is so widely accepted that there is a general presumption that there should be judicial openness, such that openness is the rule, with secret or obscured proceedings being considered as exceptions needing to be justified. The rise of social media websites such as Facebook has opened new ways for court cases to be made public; for example, in Australia, courts have considered having websites with live videos as well as blogs by retired judges to \"preserve the concepts of open justice\" in the digital age. In recent years, when governments try to cope with thorny problems such as terrorism, there are concerns that the principle of open justice can be undermined relatively easily by national security concerns. There are concerns that if new secrecy guidelines harden into precedents, that it might be hard to restore the \"centuries old system of open justice\".\n\nProponents of open justice assert numerous benefits. An overarching benefit is that it keeps courts behaving properly. Openness acts as a safeguard for the proper administration of justice. According to philosopher Jeremy Bentham, open justice is the \"keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity.\" Knowledge that court trials are regularly public encourages further attendance by the public. Further, openness can mean more accurate decisions during a trial; for example, the proceedings can spur a witness to come forth, or encourage others to submit new evidence or dispute publicized statements. Openness reduces the chance that the judgment is a mistake or that a case might have to be re-tried because of a subsequent sanction of contempt. Proponents argue that open justice benefits democracy in a general sense because citizens can see how particular laws affect particular people, and therefore citizens are in a better position to advise lawmakers about such laws. It helps ensure public confidence in legal decision-making, according to proponents. Proponents of open justice have argued that public scrutiny permits those interested to \"tap into the collective wisdom of what passes for fairness in similar cases\". It facilitates a comparison of cases.\n\nA British judge commented:\n\nStill, practical considerations often mean that the ideal of open justice must be weighed against other values such as privacy and cost and national security.\n\nThere are some cases in which publicity in a courtroom proceeding can be detrimental. In some cases, courts have opted to keep trials secret in proceedings against persons charged with terrorism, to protect its intelligence gathering methods and contacts from exposure. In a case in Britain, in which a soldier was on trial for murdering an Afghan insurgent, there was an effort to keep the trial secret to protect him from possible future retribution, but there were calls for the identity of the soldier to be publicized based on the principle of open justice. In situations when aspects of trials are kept secret, critics favoring open justice have argued that the secrecy is not needed for national security but is \"nothing more than a useful drape to cover the inconvenient or the merely embarrassing.\" Lawyers have often referred to the principle of open justice when disagreeing with a decision that was made, or calling for a retrial. In the United Kingdom, courts have tried to find the right balance between openness and secrecy, particularly in sensitive cases. In the United States, there have been concerns that the principle of open justice has not been applied to cases of immigrants \"wrongly ensnared in the post-9/11 law enforcement dragnet\" who were denied access to lawyers and relatives and sometimes deported after secret removal proceedings.\n\nThere are other factors which sometimes must be balanced against the need for open justice. For example, there are situations in which the release of confidential information such as private financial records might harm the reputation of one of the parties. In other situations, it may be necessary to protect the privacy of a minor. A further case in which openness is seen as unnecessary are when legal matters involve uncontentious information unrelated to public issues, such as the financial division of an estate after a death. Another factor sometimes working against the ideal of open justice is complexity; according to one view, court proceedings over time \"have evolved into a complex system that is hard for outsiders to understand.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Bridgegate scandal in New Jersey, an appellate judge ruled against releasing the identities of some persons involved in the scandal, on the grounds of being \"sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third parties\"; that is, releasing names to the media might unfairly tarnish reputations without a trial.\n\nAnother judge commented on tradeoffs which sometimes work against openness:\n\nThere is an \"Open Justice Initiative\" within the legal community to make justice more transparent.\n\n\n"}

No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.\n\nThe Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.\nAn enabling law for this Article XVII, Section 2 Philippine Constitutional provision, called the Initiative and Referendum Act, was authored in 1987 by senators Raul Roco (Aksyon Demokratiko) and Neptali Gonzales (Liberal Party) and was passed by the Eighth Congress of the Philippines in 1989. The law provides for the implementation of the exercise of the people's right to initiate a petition to amend the Constitution, with the Election Registrar of the Commission on Elections (Comelec) tasked under the law with the verification of the petition signatures' being by at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nThe People's Initiative can also refer to the right of Filipinos to initiate statutes as well as call for referenda on both the national and local government level, a right given by the Initiative and Referendum Act of 1987, otherwise known as Republic Act 6735.\n\nFrom late June to early August 2014, a People's Initiative Against Pork Barrel (PIAP) was repeatedly announced as up for launch in a forthcoming August 23 \"people's congress\" in Cebu City. The initiative, a multisectoral alliance-driven proposition to criminalize pork barrel fund creation and spending, was led by various groups and individuals including Cebu Archbishop Jose S. Palma, the broad #AbolishPorkMovement, the Catholic Church-backed Cebu Coalition Against the Pork Barrel System, the Church People's Alliance Against Pork Barrel, ePIRMA (Empowered People's Initiative and Reform Movement Alliance), the Makabayan Coalition (principally through Bayan Muna party-list representative Neri Colmenares), the Solidarity for Transformation, Youth Act Now, the Scrap Pork Network, and former Philippine Supreme Court Chief Justice Reynato Puno. The Cebu congress was immediately followed by a signature rally at Luneta Park, on August 25, 2014.\n\nThe proposition was one of civil society's resulting reactions to the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam of 2013 and the Million People March and other protests that followed. An exploratory \"people's congress\" to draft an initiative on spending public funds was first convened by the ePIRMA at the Asian Institute of Management Conference Center on November 9, 2013, with Puno, Colmenares and ePIRMA's legal-team head Jose M. Roy III leading the conference that was attended by representatives from various groups coming from all over the country. ePIRMA and the \"people's congress\" alliance later scheduled its first draft to be completed by January 2014 while it was awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on prior petitions against both the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the \"presidential pork\" disbursements under Benigno Aquino III's government's Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).\n\nPetitions against the PDAF were first filed with the Supreme Court by the Social Justice Society on August 28, 2013, by Greco Belgica et al. on September 3, 2013, and by Pedrito Nepomuceno on September 5, 2013. Petitions against the DAP were filed with the Supreme Court by nine separate groups of petitioners between October 7 and November 7, 2013. The petitioners included the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, GABRIELA Women's Party, Bayan Muna, Ang Kapatiran, and Belgica, among others. On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the PDAF unconstitutional; a decision on the DAP came out seven and a half months later, on July 1, 2014, also declaring basic parts of the program as unconstitutional.\n\nUnder the PIAP's proposed Pork Barrel Abolition Act, all budgets submitted to any legislative body shall contain only itemized appropriations, except funds for relief and rescue operations during calamities and funds for intelligence work and security. The proposed legislation also called for the abolition of the Presidential Social Fund, which has also been described as a form of pork barrel. Violators of this law were to be banned for life from holding public office.\n\nOn November 25, 2014, the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer \"reported that the Philippine Commission on Elections received the first 10,000 signatures from the initiative thrust in Quezon City. The signatures were from the city's first six districts, a first installment of the required 177,000 signatures from the entire city territory. Meanwhile, PIAP-Metro Manila coordinator Mark Lui Aquino said they had yet to submit to the Comelec the 50,000 to 100,000 signatures they had gathered in the metropolis. PIAP-Quezon City spokesperson Malou Turalde said, however, that Quezon City was not the first to submit to the Comelec gathered signatures for the initiative, adding that other legislative districts \"just want to be quiet.\" Aquino also expressed fear that the \"Comelec seems unready\" and added that, based on his group's monitoring, the Comelec offices in the different cities and municipalities \"do not know what to do with the signatures.\"\n\nOn September 4, 2014, Rep. Neri Colmenares announced that the ruling Liberal Party was trying to undermine the people's initiative against the pork barrel system. During his interpellation on the same day, at the Philippine Congress budget committee hearing on the 2015 budget for the Philippine Commission on Elections, Colmenares noticed that the Malacañang Palace and its allies in Congress took out the budget that they had placed for a charter change (Cha-Cha) referendum they were planning to launch. Colmenares asked for the budget to be reinserted for the people's initiative plebiscite, but budget committee vice-chair Dakila Cua (Liberal Party, formerly Lakas Kampi CMD) said that Colmenares's motion should be made during the committee deliberations on the budget. A number of Liberal Party leaders and spokesmen earlier announced their wish to amend the Constitution to allow President Benigno Aquino III to run for re-election; as under the present Constitution the President cannot run again for the same office after his single six-year term.\n\nFurthermore, groups against the pork barrel noted that the Aquino government had drafted a national budget for 2015 that still contained \"pork\" in the form of \"special purpose funds,\" thus ignoring the earlier SC ruling on such funds' unconstitutionality as well as salient points in the PIAP. The groups further noted that this pork budget allocation had ballooned to 27 billion pesos, from the previous year's PHP25 billion pesos.The groups urged Congress to junk the budget. On November 25, during the Senate plenary session tackling the said budget, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago raised the same points raised by the Makabayan group in the House of Representatives hearings, boosting the Makabayan position on the budget bill amendments.\n\nIn January 2015, Palma reiterated the importance of the initiative, saying that although the Supreme Court had already declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) as unconstitutional funds, members of Congress continued to enjoy discretionary funds under other forms.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, minutes after the anti-pork forum in Tagum City, Davao del Norte, which also launched the PIAP in the province, Dexter Ian Selebrado, 32, of the group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas - Davao del Norte (Farmers' Movement of the Philippines - Davao del Norte) and one of the local campaigners against pork barrel funds, was attacked by motorcycle-riding gunmen. As of October 1, the farmer-activist was still in critical condition.\n\nIn his January 2015 conference with the press, Palma lamented the intervention of politicians in the turnout of citizens at the signature centers in his parishes. Apart from a lack of knowledge about the pork barrel, Palma claimed that a low turnout was also a result of there being families who had children enrolled in schools under politicians' pork-funded scholarships whose relatives then refused to sign the proposition. Turnout results in other dioceses were also not good, he said. He promised, however, that the Church would not be disheartened and cited the strong support of people in such dioceses as Calbayog City.\n\nIn his blog of July 4, 2016, direct democracy advocate Jojo Soria de Veyra, a member of ePIRMA, confessed that after the initiative's launch \"the signature gathering was mostly left to certain parishes of the more organized Catholic Church, the primary backing of the Cebu Coalition. Sporadic rallies of support were organized by the Makabayan group and provincial groups. Other members of ePIRMA were seen to have moved on to various other national concerns. Manny SD Lopez—ePIRMA's leading convenor and most active campaigner on the road—would also busy himself with organizing the Christian Peace Alliance, one of the groups advocating for a drastic review of some provisions of the then-in-its-final-thrust Bangsamoro Basic Law. Lopez would also form the EdlSA 2.22.15 Coalition, a group that called for President Benigno Aquino III's resignation after the Mamasapano mishap. I submit that in this latter period I was not privy anymore to how the signature-gathering for the initiative on the pork barrel was progressing. I did hear of some pockets of resistance to the initiative, as well as the Comelec's seeming lack of enthusiasm towards verifying the signatures, but that's about it. . . . Then came the various noises leading to the 2016 general election, within which news concerning the initiative's progress were nowhere anymore to be found on Google.\" De Veyra, also a convenor of a Facebook group called Forum for Direct Democracy, then proceeded in his blog to propose amendments to the Initiative and Referendum Act that would make the law easier for the people to use as well as obligate Comelec to do its part in the initiative process within a limited time period.\n\nMeanwhile, on August 31, Senator Panfilo Lacson told the media that \"the ₱3.35-trillion proposed budget presented by Malacañang [under the newly-elected Duterte administration] to the Senate for congressional approval is laden with 'pork' and violated the Supreme Court rulings on the Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program.\"\n\n\n"}

In the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Person Rights are defined as \"rights (as of personal security, personal liberty, and private property) appertaining to the person\". Among personal rights are associated rights to protect and safeguard the body, most obviously protected by the torts of assault and battery. Furthermore, aspects of personality are protected, such as a person's reputation and honour, by the tort of defamation, and legislation protecting the privacy of individuals, and freedom of movement.\n\nIn English land law, a personal right (from the Latin \"ius in personam\") refers to a permission to use land for a specific purpose that is personal to the owner and which cannot bind future purchasers of the land. A personal right is thus distinct from a proprietary (property) right (\"ius in rem\") which refers to a right that affects the land itself, such as a freehold or leasehold.\n\n"}
{"id": "42683170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42683170", "title": "Play drive", "text": "Play drive\n\nFriedrich Schiller developed the concept of the play drive, a conjoining through contradiction of man's experience of the infinite and finite, freedom and time, sense and reason, life and form. The object of the play drive is the living form, and in contemplation of the beautiful it allows man to become most human. To understand how he comes to this conclusion, it is important to trace the origins of life and form, as a function of the two drives that the play drive mediates: the form drive and the sense drive. These two drives are themselves functions of man's person and condition, which Schiller initially describes in terms of the absolute and time.\n\nIn Friedrich Schiller's thought, the sense and the form drive arise out of man's existence as a \"person\", which endures, and man's \"condition\", the determining attributes that change. The person is described as unchangeable and eternal, and endures change. \"We pass from rest to activity, from passion to indifference, from agreement to contradiction; but we remain, and what proceeds directly from us remains too\". This personhood is grounded in itself, and not in the contradictory state of condition. Schiller argues that because man is finite, condition and person have to be separate, and cannot be grounded in each other. If they were, either change would persist or the person would change. \"And so we would, in the first place, have the idea of absolute being grounded upon itself, that is to say freedom\". Therefore, person is grounded in itself, and this grounding is responsible for man's idea of freedom. Freedom, defined as an absolute being grounded in itself.\n\nUnlike the person, condition, according to Schiller, cannot be grounded in itself. It is already established that condition cannot be grounded in person, and must therefore proceed from something else. This \"proceeding\" grounds the condition in contingency, which is man's experience of time. \"For man is not just a person situated in a particular condition. Every condition, however, every determinate existence, has its origins in time; and so man, as a phenomenal being, must also have a beginning, although the pure intelligence within him is eternal\". Man receives reality that is outside of him, as something changing within time. This changing perception is accompanied by the eternal \"I\" – the person – which organizes the change and variety into a unity. \"The reality which the supreme intelligence creates out of itself, man has first to receive, and he does in fact receive it, by way of perception, as something existing outside of him in space, and as something changing within him in time\". The perfect man, according to Schiller, would be a constant unity amongst constant change. These seemingly contradictory forces of freedom through person and time through condition, manifest themselves in man as the form and the sense drive. These drives, and consequently man's experience of freedom and time, are mediated by the play drive.\n\nThe sense drive, in Schiller's thought, is a function of man's condition. It comes from man's physical existence, and the whole of man's phenomenal existence stems from it. In his sensuous existence man is set within the limits of time, within his condition, and becomes matter. \"By matter in this context we understand nothing more than change, or reality that occupies time. Consequently this drive demands that there shall be change, that time shall have content\". Therefore, sensation of the sensuous drive is time occupied by content.\n\nThe form drive, in Schiller's view, is a function of the person grounded in itself. This drive is man's rational nature, his \"absolute existence\", and its goal is to give man freedom, so he could bring harmony to the variety of things in the world. Because the form drive insists on the absolute, \"It wants the real to be necessary and eternal, and the eternal and necessary to be real. In other words, it insist on truth and on the right\". The sense drive and the form drive are in competition, and overpower one another in the person.\n\nIf the sense drive overcomes the form drive, according to Schiller, it reduces man into matter, but leaves him without the ability to bring this matter into unity. \"As long as he merely feels, merely desires and acts upon desire, he is as yet nothing but world, if by this term we understand nothing but the formless content of time\" (117). In order to not be just \"world\", man must exercise his form drive upon matter, and \"give reality the predisposition he carries within him\". When the form drive overpowers, Schiller says we experience \"the greatest enlargement of being\", meaning that because it is a drive toward the absolute, all limitations disappear, and instead of seeing the world finitely, as he does through the sensuous drive, \"man has raised himself to a unity of ideas embracing the whole realm of phenomena\". Since the sense drive places us in time, indulging in the formal drive removes us out of time, and in doing so \"We are no longer individuals; we are species\". While this seems like a perfected state, it is only a point on the path to man reaching his maximum potential.\n\nTo maximize potential of the two drives, Schiller argues, one cannot suffocate or limit the other. The perfection of the sense drive would consist in maximizing changeability and maximizing extensity. This is the development of receptivity, through which man presents more \"surface\" to phenomena of the world. \"The more facets his receptivity develops, the more labile it is, and the more surface it presents to phenomena, so much more world does man apprehend, and all the more potentialities does he develop in himself\". To suppress this faculty would not achieve the perfection of the form drive, rather the opposite. The perfection of the form drive is accomplished in its ability to oppose the sense drive through its endurance to change. \"The more power and depth the personality achieves, and the more freedom reason attains, so much more world does man comprehend, and all the more form does he create outside of himself\". Therefore, the Form drive's autonomy and intensity are maximized as a response to the maximization of the sense drive. \"Where both these aptitudes are conjoined, man will combine the greatest fullness of existence with the highest autonomy and freedom and instead of losing himself to the world, will rather draw the latter into himself in all its infinitude of phenomena, and subject it to the unity of his reason\" This \"conjoining\" of the two faculties, are actually a mediation by the third fundamental drive, the play drive.\n\nThe play drive mediates the demands of the sense and the form drive. \"The sense drive demands that there shall be change and that time shall have a content; the form drive demands that time shall be annulled and that there shall be no change. That drive, therefore, in which both others work in concert is the play drive, reconciling becoming with absolute being and change with identity\". For the play drive to successfully mediate the two drives, man must be educated of two things. He must learn passivity, to exercise his sense drive and become receptive of the world. He must learn activity, to free his reason, as much as possible from the receptive. Accomplishing both, man is able to have a twofold experience simultaneously, \"in which he were to be at once conscious of his freedom and sensible of his existence, were at one and the same time, to feel himself matter and come to know himself as mind\". Therefore, by maximizing the constraint of the absolute and the contingency of the material, the play drive negates the demands of both drives and sets man free both physically and morally. To exist in this paradoxical state, would mean to have a \"complete intuition of his human nature\". Furthermore, \"the object that afforded him this vision would become for him the symbol of his accomplished destiny\" and this would serve him as a finite embodiment of the infinite. Schiller names this object of the play drive 'living form'.\n\nThe living form comes from a mediation of the \"objects\" of the sense and the form drives. The object of the sense drive, Schiller calls life. This concept designates all material being and all that is immediately present to the senses. It is a function of man's condition. The object of the form drive, he simply calls form. This concept includes all the formal qualities of things and their relationship to our reason. Schiller argues for the necessity of the interplay of the two objects in creation of a sculpture from a block of marble. \"As long as we merely think about his form, it is lifeless, a mere abstraction; as long as we merely feel his life, it is formless, a mere expression. Only when his form lives in our feeling and his life takes on form in our understanding, does he become a living form\". This experience of the living form, as a mediation of life and form by the play drive, is what Schiller calls the experience of beauty. \"Beauty results from the reciprocal action of two opposed drives and from the uniting of two opposed principles. The highest ideal of beauty, therefore, to be sought in the most perfect possible union and equilibrium of reality and form\". Therefore, in contemplation of the beautiful, man is exercising the play drive, and is fully human.\n"}
{"id": "74973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74973", "title": "Plot (narrative)", "text": "Plot (narrative)\n\nPlot refers to the sequence of events inside a story which affect other events through the principle of cause and effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by \"and so\". Plots can vary from simple structures such as in a traditional ballad to complex interwoven structures sometimes referred to as an \"imbroglio\". The term \"plot\" can serve as a verb and refer to a character planning future actions in the story.\n\nIn the narrative sense, the term highlights the important points which have important consequences within the story, according to Ansen Dibell. The term is similar in meaning to the term \"storyline\".\n\nEnglish novelist E. M. Forster described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, \"\"The king died, and then the queen died,\" is a story, while \"The king died, and then the queen died of grief,\" is a plot.\" Consider the following:\n\nThe first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Dibell, the plot can be described numerically as 1→3 while the story can be described as 1→2→3. A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence. Teri Shaffer Yamada agrees that a plot does not include memorable scenes within a story which do not relate directly to other events but only \"major events that move the action in a narrative.\" For example, in the 1997 film \"Titanic\", when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she's flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene which is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film \"The Empire Strikes Back\", when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite. Steve Alcorn, a fiction-writing coach, said the main plot elements of \"The Wizard of Oz\" could be summarized as follows:\n\nThe literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the \"fabula\" (фа́була) and the \"syuzhet\" (сюже́т). A fabula is the events in the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster's definition. The \"fabula\" (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the \"syuzhet\" (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non-chronological order; for example, fabula is 1</sub>, a, a, a, a, …, a>, syuzhet is 5</sub>, a, a>.\n\nToday screenwriters generally combine plot with plot structure into what is called a treatment, sometimes referred to as the three-act structure, in which a film is divided into three acts: the \"set-up\", the \"confrontation\" and the \"resolution\". Acts are connected by two plot points or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter Syd Field who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Aristotle, writing in the fourth century BC in his classic book \"The Poetics\", considered plot or \"mythos\" as the most important element of drama, even more important than character. Aristotle wrote that a tragedy, a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. He also believed that the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable. Of the utmost importance is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the psyche of the audience, he thought. In tragedy, the appropriate emotions are fear and pity, emotions which he considers in his Rhetoric. (Aristotle's work on comedy has not survived.)\n\nAristotle goes on to consider whether the tragic character suffers (pathos), and whether the tragic character commits the error with knowledge of what he is doing. He illustrates this with the question of a tragic character who is about to kill someone in his family.\n\nIn 1863, Gustav Freytag, a German writer, advocated a model based upon Aristotle's theory of tragedy. This is now called \"Freytag's pyramid,\" which divides a drama into five parts, and\nprovides function to each part. These parts are: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and denouement (catastrophe).\n\nThe first phase in Freytag's pyramid is the exposition, which introduces the characters, especially the main character, also known as the protagonist. It shows how the characters relate to one another, their goals and motivations, as well as their moral character. During the exposition, the protagonist learns their main goal and what is at stake.\n\nRising action is the second phase in Freytag's five-phase structure. It starts with a conflict, for example, the death of a character. The inciting incident is the point of the plot that begins the conflict. It is the event that catalyzes the protagonist to go into motion and to take action. Rising action involves the buildup of events until the climax.\n\nIn this phase, the protagonist understands his or her goal and begins to work toward it. Smaller problems thwart their initial success and their progress is directed primarily against these secondary obstacles. This phase demonstrates how the protagonist overcomes these obstacles.\n\nThe climax is the turning point or highest point of the story. The protagonist makes the single big decision that defines not only the outcome of the story, but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as the third of the five dramatic phases which occupies the middle of the story.\n\nAt the beginning of this phase, the protagonist finally clears away the preliminary barriers and engages with the adversary. Usually, both the protagonist and the antagonist have a plan to win against the other as they enter this phase. For the first time, the audience sees the pair going against one another in direct or nearly direct conflict.\n\nThis struggle usually results in neither character completely winning or losing. In most cases, each character's plan is both partially successful and partially foiled by their adversary. The central struggle between the two characters is unique in that the protagonist makes a decision which shows their moral quality, and ultimately decides their fate. In a tragedy, the protagonist here makes a poor decision or a miscalculation that demonstrates their tragic flaw.\n\nAccording to Freytag, the falling action phase consists of events that lead to the ending. Character's actions resolve the problem. In the beginning of this phase, the antagonist often has the upper hand. The protagonist has never been further from accomplishing their goal. The outcome depends on which side the protagonist has put themselves on.\n\nIn this phase the protagonist and antagonist have solved their problems and either the protagonist or antagonist wins the conflict. The conflict officially ends. Some stories show what happens to the characters after the conflict ends and/or they show what happens to the characters in the future.\n\nA plot device is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique.\n\nFamiliar types of plot devices include the \"deus ex machina\", the MacGuffin, the red herring, and Chekhov's gun.\n\nA plot outline is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a \"one page\" because of its length. It is generally longer and more detailed than a standard synopsis, which is usually only one or two paragraphs, but shorter and less detailed than a treatment or a step outline. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the \"nemu\" (pronounced like the English word \"name\"). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are:\n\n\nIn fiction writing, a plot outline is a laundry list of scenes with each line being a separate plot point, and the outline helps give a story a \"solid backbone and structure\".\n\nAn \"A-Plot\" is a cinema and television term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.\n\nA plot summary is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to. Also, it is no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28737247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28737247", "title": "Preference (economics)", "text": "Preference (economics)\n\nWith the help of the scientific method many practical decisions of life can be modelled, resulting in testable predictions about human behavior. Although economists are usually not interested in the underlying causes of the preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis.\n\nIn 1926 Ragnar Frisch developed for the first time a mathematical model of preferences in the context of economic demand and utility functions. Up to then, economists had developed an elaborated theory of demand that omitted \"primitive characteristics\" of people. This omission ceased when, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, logical positivism predicated the need of theoretical concepts to be related with observables. Whereas economists in the 18th and 19th centuries felt comfortable theorizing about utility, with the advent of logical positivism in the 20th century, they felt that it needed more of an empirical structure. Because binary choices are directly observable, it instantly appealed to economists. The search for observables in microeconomics is taken even further by revealed preference theory.\n\nSince the pioneer efforts of Frisch in the 1920s, one of the major issues which has pervaded the theory of preferences is the representability of a preference structure with a real-valued function. This has been achieved by mapping it to the mathematical index called \"utility\". Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944 book \"Games and Economic Behaviour\" treated preferences as a formal relation whose properties can be stated axiomatically. These type of axiomatic handling of preferences soon began to influence other economists: Marschak adopted it by 1950, Houthakker employed it in a 1950 paper, and Kenneth Arrow perfected it in his 1951 book \"Social Choice and Individual Values\".\n\nGérard Debreu, influenced by the ideas of the Bourbaki group, championed the axiomatization of consumer theory in the 1950s, and the tools he borrowed from the mathematical field of binary relations have become mainstream since then. Even though the economics of choice can be examined either at the level of utility functions or at the level of preferences, to move from one to the other can be useful. For example, shifting the conceptual basis from an abstract preference relation to an abstract utility scale results in a new mathematical framework, allowing new kinds of conditions on the structure of preference to be formulated and investigated.\n\nAnother historical turnpoint can be traced back to 1895, when Georg Cantor proved in a theorem that if a binary relation is \"linearly ordered\", then it is also isomorphically embeddable in the ordered real numbers. This notion would become very influential for the theory of preferences in economics: by the 1940s prominent authors such as Paul Samuelson, would theorize about people actually having weakly ordered preferences.\n\nSuppose the set of all states of the world is formula_1 and an agent has a preference relation on formula_1. It is common to mark the weak preference relation by formula_3, so that formula_4 means \"the agent wants y at least as much as x\" or \"the agent weakly prefers y to x\".\n\nThe symbol formula_5 is used as a shorthand to the indifference relation: formula_6, which reads \"the agent is indifferent between y and x\".\n\nThe symbol formula_7 is used as a shorthand to the strong preference relation: formula_8, which reads \"the agent strictly prefers y to x\".\n\nIn everyday speech, the statement \"\"x\" is preferred to \"y\"\" is generally understood to mean that someone chooses \"x\" over \"y\". However, decision theory rests on more precise definitions of preferences given that there are many experimental conditions influencing people's choices in many directions.\n\nSuppose a person is confronted with a mental experiment that she must solve with the aid of introspection. She is offered apples (\"x\") and oranges (\"y\"), and is asked to verbally choose one of the two. A decision scientist observing this single event would be inclined to say that whichever is chosen is the preferred alternative.\n\nUnder several repetitions of this experiment (and assuming laboratory conditions controlling outside factors), if the scientist observes that apples are chosen 51% of the time it would mean that formula_9. If half of the time oranges are chosen, then formula_10. Finally, if 51% of the time she chooses oranges it means that formula_11. Preference is here being identified with a greater frequency of choice.\n\nThis experiment implicitly assumes that the trichotomy property holds for the order relation. Otherwise, out of 100 repetitions, some of them will give as a result that neither apples, oranges or ties are chosen. These few cases of uncertainty will ruin any preference information resulting from the frequency attributes of the other valid cases.\n\nHowever, this example was used for only illustrative purposes, and it should not be interpreted as an indication that the economic theory of preferences starts with experiments and moves on to theorems. On the contrary, the method used in the theory preferences is essentially an armchair method. Economists make assumptions, and from these assumptions they deduce theorems which presumably can be tested, even though the test is not indispensable.\n\nConsumers are by definition demanders of goods and services. Standard economic theory states that their demand behaviour can be thought of maximizing a utility index, or its parallel: the ranking of the set of possible consumption bundles by means of either the binary relation \"at least as good as\" or the relation \"strictly preferred as\".\n\nOf all the available bundles of goods and services, only one is ultimately chosen. The theory of preferences examines the problem of getting to this optimal choice using a \"system of preferences\" within a budgetary limitation.\n\nIn reality, people do not necessarily rank or order their preferences in a consistent way. In preference theory, some idealized conditions are regularly imposed on the preferences of economic actors. One of the most important of these idealized conditions is the \"axiom of transitivity\":\n\nAxiom of transitivity: If alternative formula_12 is weakly preferred to alternative formula_13, and formula_13 to formula_15, then formula_12 is weakly preferred to formula_15.\n\nSymbolically, this can be stated as\n\nSometimes a weaker axiom (that is, it is implied by transitivity, but not vice versa), called \"quasi-transitivity\" is used, which only requires the above for strict preferences:\n\nThe language of binary relations allow one to write down exactly what is meant by \"ranked set of preferences\", and thus gives an unambiguous definition of \"order\". A preference relation should not be confused with the order relation formula_24 used to indicate which of two real numbers is greater. Order relations over the real number line satisfy an extra condition:\n\nBut in preference relations, two things can be equally liked without being in some sense numerically equal. Hence, an \"indifference relation\" is used instead of an equality relation (the symbol formula_28 denotes this kind of relation). Thus we have\n\nA system of preferences or \"preference structure\" refers to the set of qualitative relations between different alternatives of consumption. For example, if the alternatives are:\n\n\nIn this example, a preference structure would be:\n\n\"The apple is at least as preferred as the orange\", and \"The orange is as least as preferred as the Banana\". One can use formula_32 to symbolize that some alternative is \"at least as preferred as\" another one, which is just a binary relation on the set of alternatives. Therefore:\n\n\nThe former qualitative relation can be preserved when mapped into a numerical structure, if we impose certain desirable properties over the binary relation: these are the \"axioms of preference order\". For instance: Let us take the apple and assign it the arbitrary number 5. Then take the orange and let us assign it a value lower than 5, since the orange is less preferred than the apple. If this procedure is extended to the banana, one may prove by induction that if formula_35 is defined on {apple, orange} and it represents a well-defined binary relation called \"at least as preferred as\" on this set, then it can be extended to a function formula_35 defined on {apple, orange, banana} and it will represent \"at least as preferred as\" on this larger set.\n\nExample:\n\n\n5 > 3 > 2 = u(apple) > u(orange) > u(banana)\n\nand this is consistent with Apple formula_32 Orange, and with Orange formula_32 Banana.\n\nAxiom of order (Completeness): For all formula_12 and formula_13 we have formula_41 or formula_42 or both.\n\nIn order for preference theory to be useful mathematically, we need to assume the axiom of continuity. Continuity simply means that there are no ‘jumps’ in people’s preferences. In mathematical terms, if we prefer point A along a preference curve to point B, points very close to A will also be preferred to B. This allows preference curves to be differentiated. The continuity assumption is \"stronger than needed\" in the sense that it indeed guarantees the existence of a \"continuous utility function\" representation. Continuity is, therefore, a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one, for a system of preferences.\n\nAlthough commodity bundles come in discrete packages, economists treat their units as a continuum, because very little is gained from recognizing their discrete nature. According to Silberberg, the two approaches are reconcilable by this rhetorical device: When a consumer makes repeated purchases of a product, the commodity spaces can get converted from the discrete items to the time rates of consumption. Instead of, say, noting that a consumer purchased one loaf of bread on Monday, another on Friday and another the following Tuesday, we can speak of an average rate of consumption of bread equal to 7/4 loaves per week. There is no reason why the average consumption per week cannot be any real number, thus allowing differentiability of the consumer's utility function. We can speak of continuous \"services of goods\", even if the goods themselves are purchased in discrete units.\n\nAlthough some authors include reflexivity as one of the axioms required to obtain representability (this axiom states that formula_43), it is redundant inasmuch as the completeness axiom implies it already.\n\nEveryday experience suggests that people at least talk about their preferences as if they had personal \"standards of judgment\" capable of being applied to the particular domain of alternatives that present themselves from time to time. Thus, the axioms are an attempt to model the decision maker's preferences, not over the actual choice, but over the type of desirable procedure (a procedure that any human being would like to follow). Behavioral economics investigates inconsistent behavior (i.e. behavior that violates the axioms) of people. Believing in axioms in a normative way does not imply that everyone is asserted to behave according to them. Instead, they are a basis for suggesting a mode of behavior, one that people would like to see themselves or others following.\n\nHere is an illustrative example of the normative implications of the theory of preferences: Consider a decision maker who needs to make a choice. Assume that this is a choice of where to live or whom to marry and that the decision maker has asked an economist for advice. The economist, who wants to engage in normative science, attempts to tell the decision maker how she should make decisions.\n\nEconomist: I suggest that you attach a utility index to each alternative, and choose the alternative with the highest utility.\n\nDecision Maker: You've been brainwashed. You think only in terms of functions. But this is an important decision, there are people involved, emotions, these are not functions!\n\nEconomist: Would you feel comfortable with cycling among three possible options? Preferring \"x\" to \"y\", and then \"y\" to \"z\", but then again \"z\" to \"x\"?\n\nDecision Maker: No, this is very silly and counterproductive. I told you that there are people involved, and I do not want to play with their feelings.\n\nEconomist: Good. So now let me tell you a secret: if you follow these two conditions making decision, and avoid cycling, then you can be described as if you are maximizing a utility function.\n\nConsumers whose preference structures violate transitivity would get exposed to being exploited by some unscrupulous person. For instance, Maria prefers apples to oranges, oranges to bananas, and bananas to apples. Let her be endowed with an apple, which she can trade in a market. Because she prefers bananas to apples, she is willing to pay, say, one cent to trade her apple for a banana. Afterwards, Maria is willing to pay another cent to trade her banana for an orange, and again the orange for an apple, and so on. There are other examples of this kind of irrational behaviour.\n\nCompleteness implies that some choice will be made, an assertion that is more philosophically questionable. In most applications, the set of consumption alternatives is infinite and the consumer is not conscious of all preferences. For example, one does not have to choose over going on holiday by plane or by train: if one does not have enough money to go on holiday anyway then it is not necessary to attach a preference order to those alternatives (although it can be nice to dream about what one would do if one would win the lottery). However, preference can be interpreted as a hypothetical choice that could be made rather than a conscious state of mind. In this case, completeness amounts to an assumption that the consumers can always make up their mind whether they are indifferent or prefer one option when presented with any pair of options.\n\nUnder some extreme circumstances there is no \"rational\" choice available. For instance, if asked to choose which one of one's children will be killed, as in Sophie's Choice, there is no rational way out of it. In that case preferences would be incomplete, since \"not being able to choose\" is not the same as \"being indifferent\".\n\nThe \"indifference relation\" ~ is an equivalence relation. Thus we have a quotient set S/~ of equivalence classes of S, which forms a partition of S. Each equivalence class is a set of packages that is equally preferred.\nIf there are only two commodities, the equivalence classes can be graphically represented as indifference curves.\nBased on the preference relation on S we have a preference relation on S/~. As opposed to the former, the latter is antisymmetric and a total order.\n\nIn economics, a utility function is often used to represent a preference structure such that formula_44 if and only if formula_45. The idea is to associate each class of indifference with a real number such that, if one class is preferred to the other, then the number of the first one is greater than that of the second one. When a preference order is both transitive and complete, then it is standard practice to call it a \"rational preference relation\", and the people who comply with it are \"rational agents\". A transitive and complete relation is called a \"weak order\" (or \"total preorder\"). The literature on preferences is far from being standardized regarding terms such as \"complete\", \"partial\", \"strong\", and \"weak\". Together with the terms \"total\", \"linear\", \"strong complete\", \"quasi-orders\", \"pre-orders\" and \"sub-orders\", which also have a different meaning depending on the author's taste, there has been an abuse of semantics in the literature.\n\nAccording to Simon Board, a continuous utility function always exists if formula_46 is a continuous rational preference relation on formula_47. For any such preference relation, there are many continuous utility functions that represent it. Conversely, every utility function can be used to construct a unique preference relation.\n\nAll the above is independent of the prices of the goods and services and of the budget constraints faced by consumers. These determine the \"feasible\" bundles (which they can afford). According to the standard theory, consumers chooses a bundle within their budget such that no other feasible bundle is preferred over it; therefore their utility is maximized.\n\n\nLexicographic preferences are a special case of preferences that assign an infinite value to a good, when compared with the other goods of a bundle.\n\nThe possibility of defining a strict preference relation formula_48 as distinguished from the weaker one formula_32, and vice versa, suggests in principle an alternative approach of starting with the strict relation formula_48 as the primitive concept and deriving the weaker one and the indifference relation. However, an indifference relation derived this way will generally not be transitive. According to Kreps \"beginning with strict preference makes it easier to discuss noncomparability possibilities\".\n\nUnder certain assumptions, individual preferences can be aggregated onto the preferences of a group of people. However, Arrow's impossibility theorem states that voting systems sometimes cannot convert individual preferences into desirable community-wide acts of choice.\n\nPreference relations were initially applied only to alternatives that involve no risk and uncertainties because this is an assumption of the homo economicus model of behaviour. Nonetheless, a very similar theory of preferences has also been applied to the space of simple lotteries, as in expected utility theory. In this case a preference structure over lotteries can also be represented by a utility function.\n\nSome critics say that rational theories of choice and preference theories rely too heavily on the assumption of invariance, which states that the relation of preference should not depend on the description of the options or on the method of elicitation. But without this assumption, one's preferences cannot be represented as maximization of utility.\n\nMilton Friedman said that segregating taste factors from objective factors (i.e. prices, income, availability of goods) is conflicting because both are \"inextricably interwoven\".\n"}

It is thus the set formula_1 (where formula_2 is the set of the real numbers) with the standard arithmetic operations extended where possible, sometimes denoted by formula_3 The added point is called the point at infinity, because it is considered as a neighbour of both ends of the real line. More precisely, the point at infinity is the limit of every sequence of real numbers whose absolute values are increasing and unbounded.\n\nThe projectively extended real line may be identified with the projective line over the reals in which three points have been assigned specific values (e.g. , and ). The projectively extended real line must not be confused with the extended real number line, in which and are distinct.\n\nUnlike most mathematical models of the intuitive concept of 'number', this structure allows division by zero:\n\nfor nonzero \"a\". In particular , and moreover , making reciprocal, , a total function in this structure. The structure, however, is not a field, and none of the binary arithmetic operations are total, as witnessed for example by being undefined despite the reciprocal being total. It has usable interpretations, however – for example, in geometry, a vertical line has \"infinite\" slope.\n\nThe projectively extended real line extends the field of real numbers in the same way that the Riemann sphere extends the field of complex numbers, by adding a single point called conventionally formula_5.\n\nIn contrast, the extended real number line (also called the two-point compactification of the real line) distinguishes between formula_6 and formula_7.\n\nThe order relation cannot be extended to formula_8 in a meaningful way. Given a number formula_9, there is no convincing argument to define either formula_10 or that formula_11. Since formula_5 can't be compared with any of the other elements, there's no point in retaining this relation on formula_8. However, order on formula_2 is used in definitions in formula_8.\n\nFundamental to the idea that ∞ is a point \"no different from any other\" is the way the real projective line is a homogeneous space, in fact homeomorphic to a circle. For example the general linear group of 2×2 real invertible matrices has a transitive action on it. The group action may be expressed by Möbius transformations, (also called linear fractional transformations), with the understanding that when the denominator of the linear fractional transformation is 0, the image is ∞.\n\nThe detailed analysis of the action shows that for any three distinct points \"P\", \"Q\" and \"R\", there is a linear fractional transformation taking \"P\" to 0, \"Q\" to 1, and \"R\" to ∞ that is, the group of linear fractional transformations is triply transitive on the real projective line. This cannot be extended to 4-tuples of points, because the cross-ratio is invariant.\n\nThe terminology projective line is appropriate, because the points are in 1-to-1 correspondence with one-dimensional linear subspaces of formula_16.\n\nThe arithmetic operations on this space are an extension of the same operations on reals. A motivation for the new definitions is the limits of functions of real numbers.\n\nIn addition to the standard operations on the subset formula_2 of formula_8, the following operations are defined for formula_19, with exceptions as indicated:\n\nThe following expressions cannot be motivated by considering limits of real functions, and no definition of them allows the statement of the standard algebraic properties to be retained unchanged in form for all defined cases.</math>, resolve to the standard rules: see Wheel theory.}} Consequently, they are left undefined:\n\nThe following equalities mean: \"Either both sides are undefined, or both sides are defined and equal.\" This is true for any formula_22.\nThe following is true whenever the right-hand side is defined, for any formula_22.\nIn general, all laws of arithmetic that are valid for formula_2 are also valid for formula_8 whenever all the occurring expressions are defined.\n\nThe concept of an interval can be extended to formula_8. However, since it is an unordered set, the interval has a slightly different meaning. The definitions for closed intervals are as follows (it is assumed that \nformula_29):\n\nWith the exception of when the end-points are equal, the corresponding open and half-open intervals are defined by removing the respective endpoints.\n\nThe open intervals as base define a topology on formula_8. Sufficient for a base are the finite open intervals in formula_2 and the intervals formula_40 for all formula_41 such that formula_42.\n\nAs said, the topology is homeomorphic to a circle. Thus it is metrizable corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this circle (either measured straight or along the circle). There is no metric which is an extension of the ordinary metric on formula_2.\n\nInterval arithmetic extends to formula_8 from formula_2. The result of an arithmetic operation on intervals is always an interval, except when the intervals with a binary operation contain incompatible values leading to an undefined result. In particular, we have, for every formula_46:\nirrespective of whether either interval includes formula_48 and formula_5.\n\nThe tools of calculus can be used to analyze functions of formula_8. The definitions are motivated by the topology of this space.\n\nLet formula_51.\n\nLet formula_59.\n\nThe limit of \"f(x)\" as \"x\" approaches \"p\" is \"L\", denoted\nif and only if for every neighbourhood \"A\" of \"L\", there is a punctured neighbourhood \"B\" of \"p\", such that formula_52 implies formula_62.\n\nThe one-sided limit of \"f(x)\" as \"x\" approaches \"p\" from the right (left) is \"L\", denoted\nif and only if for every neighbourhood \"A\" of \"L\", there is a right-sided (left-sided) punctured neighbourhood \"B\" of \"p\", such that formula_52 implies formula_62.\n\nIt can be shown that formula_60 if and only if both formula_63 and formula_69.\n\nThe definitions given above can be compared with the usual definitions of limits of real functions. In the following statements, formula_71, the first limit is as defined above, and the second limit is in the usual sense:\n\nLet formula_84. Then \"p\" is a limit point of \"A\" if and only if every neighbourhood of \"p\" includes a point formula_85 such that formula_86.\n\nLet formula_87, \"p\" a limit point of \"A\". The limit of \"f(x)\" as \"x\" approaches \"p\" through \"A\" is \"L\", if and only if for every neighbourhood \"B\" of \"L\", there is a punctured neighbourhood \"C\" of \"p\", such that formula_88 implies formula_89.\n\nThis corresponds to the regular topological definition of continuity, applied to the subspace topology on formula_90, and the restriction of \"f\" to formula_90.\n\nLet\n\n\"f\" is continuous at \"p\" if and only if \"f\" is defined at \"p\" and:\n\nLet\n\n\"f\" is continuous in \"A\" if and only if for every formula_95, \"f\" is defined at \"p\" and the limit of \"f\"(\"x\") as \"x\" approaches \"p\" through \"A\" is \"f\"(\"p\").\n\nAn interesting feature is that every rational function \"P\"(\"x\")/\"Q\"(\"x\"), where \"P\"(\"x\") and \"Q\"(\"x\") have no common factor, is continuous in formula_8. Also, If tan is extended so that\n\nthen tan is continuous in formula_2. However, many elementary functions, such as trigonometric and exponential functions, are discontinuous at formula_5. For example, sin is continuous in formula_2 but discontinuous at formula_5.\n\nThus 1/\"x\" is continuous on formula_8 but not on the affinely extended real number system formula_103. Conversely, the function arctan can be extended continuously on formula_103, but not on formula_8.\n\nWhen the real projective line is considered in the context of the real projective plane, then the consequences of Desargues' theorem are implicit. In particular, the construction of the projective harmonic conjugate relation between points is part of the structure of the real projective line. For instance, given any pair of points, the point at infinity is the projective harmonic conjugate of their midpoint.\n\nAs projectivities preserve the harmonic relation, they form the automorphisms of the real projective line. The projectivities are described algebraically as homographies, since the real numbers form a ring, according to the general construction of a projective line over a ring. Collectively they form the group PGL(2,R).\n\nThe projectivities which are their own inverses are called involutions. A hyperbolic involution has two fixed points. Two of these correspond to elementary, arithmetic operations on the real projective line: negation and reciprocation. Indeed, 0 and ∞ are fixed under negation, while 1 and −1 are fixed under reciprocation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "973437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=973437", "title": "Robert Berdella", "text": "Robert Berdella\n\nRobert Andrew Berdella Jr. (January 31, 1949October 8, 1992) was an American serial killer, known as The Kansas City Butcher and The Collector, who kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered at least six men between 1984 and 1987 in Kansas City, Missouri after having forced his victims to endure periods of up to six weeks of captivity.\n\nDescribing his murders as being \"some of my darkest fantasies becoming my reality\", Berdella pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the first degree murder of one of his victims, Larry Pearson, in August 1988, and would later plead guilty to one further charge of first degree murder, and four charges of second degree murder in December 1988. He died of a heart attack while incarcerated at the Missouri State Penitentiary in October 1992.\n\nBerdella became known as \"The Kansas City Butcher\" due to his practice of extensively dissecting his victims' bodies, which he would then dispose of in garbage bags, and \"The Collector\" due to both the movie which he stated was the basis of the fantasies behind the modus operandi of his crimes, and much of the evidence subsequently uncovered by investigators.\n\nRobert Andrew Berdella Jr. was born on January 31, 1949, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, the first of two sons born to Robert Berdella Sr., a die setter for the Ford Motor Company, and Mary Berdella, a homemaker. Berdella's father was a Catholic of Italian descent, and raised his family in a deeply religious household, in which the family regularly attended mass, and both sons regularly attended religious education courses.\n\nAs a child, Berdella was intelligent, but a loner who rarely played outside his home, and seldom had friends visit to socialize. He had a speech impediment and wore thick glasses from the age of five because he was severely nearsighted. He was also diagnosed with high blood pressure for which he took several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure, and often compared him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father physically and emotionally abused his children, and beat them with a leather strap.\n\nBerdella performed well academically, though teachers often found him difficult to teach, in part due both his aloofness, and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Resultantly, as a child, he also seldom socialized in social activities at school with his peers.\n\nWhen Berdella reached puberty, he discovered that he was homosexual; initially, he kept this fact a closely guarded secret, and he did not become open about his sexuality for several years. Nonetheless, in his early teens, he briefly had a girlfriend.\n\nBy his mid-teens, Berdella had begun to display a degree of self-confidence, which would often manifest itself via his attitude to other individuals in which he would exert a somewhat rude and condescending attitude—particularly toward women. He learned about cooking and art and developed showmanship. On Christmas Day 1965, the Berdella family drove to Canton, Ohio to visit relatives. That evening, Berdella's father had a heart attack. Two days later, Berdella returned to Cuyahoga Falls by himself. When he arrived home his family told him his father had died. He was 39. Berdella sought solace in his religionand later read extensively about many faithsbut became cynical about all religion.\n\nIn 1965, Berdella saw the film adaptation of the John Fowles book \"The Collector\". The plot of this movie revolves around a lonely male who stalks, then abducts a young woman he finds attractive, and holds her captive in his windowless, stone basement, viewing her as little more than an attractive specimen. After several weeks, the female captive dies of a contracted illness despite her captor's efforts to keep her alive. Berdella later stated this movie had formed a lasting impression on him.\n\nShortly after the death of Berdella's father, his mother remarried. This act was met with resentment by her older son, who viewed the move as a form of betrayal against his father. As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign pen pals. Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to pen pals in countries such as Vietnam and Burma and the fact these pen pals would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive art, photographs, and antiques. From approximately 1965, he would begin avidly collecting these artifacts; this practice would later inspire him to open his own business in 1982.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Berdella graduated from Cuyahoga Falls High School. Throughout his studies in high school, he had earned such excellent grades and displayed such potential that in 1966, one teacher had placed him in an independent study program. Shortly after graduation, Berdella relocated to Kansas City. Here, he enrolled in the Kansas City Art Institute, with aspirations of becoming a college professor. In his first year at the Kansas City Art Institute, Berdella was considered an attentive and talented student, although by his second year in art school, Berdella became vocally anti-authoritarian. He also became acquainted with a clique of students who supplied him with drugs which he then sold to other students at a profit. As such, he acquired a reputation among his fellow students as a minor drug dealer. In addition, he began regularly abusing alcohol. He also engaged in acts of animal torture on at least three occasions while a student at the Kansas City Art Institute; during two of these instances, he tortured a duck and a chicken in the presence of his peers, and in the third instance, he experimented with sedatives and tranquilizers on a dog.\n\nAt the age of 19, Berdella was arrested for attempting to sell methamphetamines to an undercover officer; he was released after posting a $3,000 bond (), and would later plead guilty to the offense and was handed a five-year suspended sentence. One month after this first arrest, Berdella and two other students were arrested for possession of marijuana and in Johnson County. On this occasion, Berdella could not post bond, and he spent five days in jail, although the charges against him and one of the other students would be dropped due to a lack of evidence.\n\nIn 1969, Berdella voluntarily withdrew from the Kansas City Art Institute after receiving harsh criticism from college administrators for killing, then cooking a duck for the sake of art. He chose to remain in Kansas City and in September of that year, he moved into an address located within the Hyde Park district of Kansas City: 4315 Charlotte Street. Having by this stage long been open about being gay, Berdella began spending much of his free time with male prostitutes, drug addicts, petty criminals, and runaways. These individuals he would typically befriend, then try to help free them from their drug addictions and general lethargic or criminal lifestyles, and he was adamant that, throughout much of the 1970s, he had no physical contact whatsoever with any of these individuals. To several of his neighbors, Berdella stated he gradually almost felt like a foster parent to many of these youths. Nonetheless, by the early 1980s, many of his older acquaintances had ceased any form of social contact with him, thus meaning Berdella increasingly relied on these young men as a source of companionship and friendship. He would retrospectively claim to have become increasingly frustrated at many of these individuals' collective ignorance to his efforts to assist them to steer their lifestyles away from harm and deterioration, and their basic flouting of him.\n\nDespite these later claims to investigators, Berdella would often engage in sexual relations with several of these individuals, and would establish a degree of control over them—in part to engage in these sexual relations—via methods including loaning them money, and allowing them to live rent free at his house for periods of time.\n\nTo his neighbors, Berdella was considered a flamboyant, yet helpful and civic-minded individual, despite the generally unkempt state of his property, and his somewhat haughty attitude. Beginning in the late 1970s, Berdella would assist in the organizational activities of the South Hyde Park Crime Prevention and Neighborhood Association; becoming their chairman in the early 1980s and encouraging neighborhood‑watch patrols. (He remained active in this association until the mid-1980s, when he relinquished his position within the organization.) Berdella would also represent his neighborhood at fundraising events for a local public television station, although he would also disengage himself from these events by the mid-1980s.\n\nShortly before Berdella had moved into his Charlotte Street address, he began working as a short-order cook in various restaurants around Kansas City—in part to help pay the lawyer fees and fines accrued from the drug arrests he had endured at age 19. As a means of obtaining additional income, he also sold arcane items of art and antiques he had accrued and collected across then-recent years from contacts he had established in Africa, Asia, South America, and various Pacific Rim countries. He would initially operate this side-business from his home. Both his career and side-business gradually flourished, and by the mid-1970s, Berdella began working as a senior cook at several renowned Kansas City restaurants; also joining a local chefs' association, and helping establish a training program for aspiring chefs at a local community college. Simultaneously, as his own business began to burgeon, he began to devote more of his attention to his own business as opposed to his work as a chef. By 1981, he had established several contractual agreements with both national and international contacts for his own business. He viewed this business as his full-time job and later ceased working as a chef.\n\nIn 1982, Berdella began renting his own booth at the Westport Flea Market. This store was named Bob's Bazaar Bizarre, and primarily sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a profit loss, or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home as a means of gaining additional income.\n\nAt his work premises, Berdella became acquainted with a fellow merchant named Paul Howell, who operated a booth adjacent to his own. Soon, Berdella became acquainted with Paul Howell's younger son, Jerry. Initially, Jerry Howell and his friends scathed and taunted Berdella over his overt homosexuality, although according to Berdella, Jerry Howell later confided in him that he and his friends occasionally earned money as male prostitutes.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Paul Howell had relocated his business from the Westport flea market to a store within a building located close to the intersection of 39th and Main Street. His family had also moved into an apartment above the shop, and despite his younger son occasionally engaging in heated arguments with Berdella, they would invariably reignite a casual friendship—often via Berdella offering his legal or financial assistance should Jerry endure minor scrapes with the law. By the summer of 1984, Jerry Howell had turned 19.\n\nBerdella is believed to have killed his first victim on July 5, 1984. His first known victim was 19-year-old Jerry Howell, with whom he had become closely reacquainted in the year prior to his murder and whom he abducted on the promise of driving the youth to attend a dancing contest in Merriam. According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, Valium and acepromazine both in his car and at his house until the youth became unconscious. He then injected Howell with a heavy tranquilizer before binding the youth to his bed.\n\nHowell was restrained to Berdella's bed for a period of approximately 28 hours. Throughout this period of captivity, Berdella repeatedly drugged, tortured, raped and violated the youth with foreign objects, repeatedly ignoring Howell's intermittent questioning as to why he was being treated in this manner, and pleas to be freed before, according to Berdella, the youth \"either asphyxiated on [his own] vomit, or the combination of the gag and the medicines were too strong for him to be able to catch breath\". Berdella would later state that he did briefly attempt to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation upon Howell after he had died before dragging his body to the basement. He then suspended Howell's body above a large cooking pot and made several incisions to the youth's inner elbows and jugular vein, before leaving the body suspended in this position overnight to allow the blood to drain from his corpse. The following day, he dismembered Howell's body using a chainsaw and boning knives, before wrapping the sections in newspaper and trash bags. These bags were later placed inside larger trash bags which Berdella placed outside for a garbage crew to collect and take to a landfill.\n\nLater questioned by officers investigating Howell's disappearance, Berdella claimed to have driven the youth to Merriam as promised, and that the two had parted company close to Howell's intended destination. Berdella further claimed he had not seen the youth since.\n\nAs would be the case with all Berdella's murders, he kept a detailed log in which he documented each act of sexual and physical torture inflicted upon his victim. Berdella would recall that—like the subsequent victims he would hold captive—Howell had repeatedly pleaded for his ongoing abuse and torture to cease throughout the period of his capture, although he (Berdella) would either ignore these pleas, taunt his victim, or threaten him. He would remain adamant to investigators that this would be not for his enjoyment, but what he termed his \"physical and mental satisfaction\".\n\nOn April 10, 1985, a former lodger of Berdella's, 23-year-old Robert Sheldon, arrived on his doorstep, asking if he could again stay at his house for short period of time. According to Berdella, although Sheldon was responsible in paying rent, he considered him \"an inconvenience\" and, although he was not physically attracted to this victim, chose to drug and hold him captive on April 12 when he returned home from work to find Sheldon intoxicated in his home. Berdella was adamant he held no firm malice toward Sheldon, but saw him as an individual upon whom he could \"express some of the anger and frustration that I had toward other people on\". Sheldon was drugged with sedatives and held captive in the second floor bedroom for three days, enduring forms of torture such as the swabbing of drain cleaner in his left eye, the insertion of needles beneath his fingertips, the binding of his wrists with piano wire with the intention of permanently damaging the nerves in his hands, and filling his ears with caulking to reduce his hearing capacity.\n\nThree days after Berdella had begun holding Sheldon captive, on April15, a workman came to perform some scheduled work on the roof of his home, leading Berdella to choose to fatally suffocate Sheldon by placing a sack over his head, which he then tightened with a piece of rope. He later dissected Sheldon's body in the third floor bathroom.\n\nThe following June, Berdella found Mark Wallace (whom he vaguely knew via Wallace having previously helped him with yard work) hiding in his tool shed to seek shelter from a severe thunderstorm. As had been the case with Robert Sheldon, Berdella invited him inside his house, and, noting Wallace's acute state of tenseness and depression, volunteered to inject him with chlorpromazine with the explanation this would \"calm down and relax\" him. Wallace willingly accepted the offer and, 30 minutes later, Berdella decided to render him captive. Wallace was carried to the second floor bedroom where he endured almost a day of captivity and torture including the application of alligator clips to his nipples to facilitate electrical shocks to his body at any point at which he (Wallace) began regressing into a state of unconsciousness. According to Berdella, one hour after his \"experimenting\" with hypodermic needles by inserting them into various muscles upon his victim's back, Mark Wallace died through a combination of \"the drugs, the gag, and the lack of oxygen\". He noted this victim's time of death as being 7:00 p.m. on June 23.\n\nOn September 26, 1985, Berdella answered a phone call from an acquaintance named James Ferris, who asked to stay at Berdella's home for a short time. Berdella accepted with the specific intention of kidnapping Ferris, whom he arranged to meet at a bar that evening. Despite the brutality to which he had subjected his first three victims, Berdella claimed that Ferris was the first victim upon whom he intentionally inflicted torture. He also informed investigators there were occasions during his final three victims' periods of captivity when he ceased making additions to his abuse logs because he assumed the victim would not \"be able to make it much longer\".\n\nBerdella brought Ferris home and drugged him with crushed tranquilizers he had concealed in a meal, then tied him to his bed before torturing him almost constantly for approximately 27hours. The torture included repeated administering of 7,700-volt electrical shocks to the shoulder and testicles for up to five minutes in each instance, and acupuncture via hypodermic needles to the neck and genitals. Ferris gradually became delirious, but Berdella continued his physical and sexual assaults until he noted in his log that Ferris was \"Unable to sit up more than \". The next entry read \"Very delayed breathing\", and finally, Berdella noted that Ferris died with a slang term he had used in his career as a chef, \"86\", which Berdella later explained \"meant anything from 'Throw it out' to 'Stop the project.\n\nTodd Stoops was a drug addict and sometime prostitute who, alongside his wife, had twice lived briefly at Berdella's house in 1984. After Stoops and his wife moved out of Berdella's home the second time, Berdella did not see him again until a chance encounter at KansasCity's Liberty Memorial Park on June 17, 1986. Berdella invited him to his house with an offer of lunch, with an added incentive of sex as Stoops stated he needed $13 to purchase drugs (equivalent to $ in ). \n\nBerdella would later stress to investigators he had been extremely physically attracted to Stoops, and this victim was held captive for two weeks before he died, with him gradually increasing his captive's terror to make him a cooperative and incapacitated sex slave. Berdella used electrical shocks through Stoops's closed eyes in an attempt to blind him and injected drain cleaner into his larynx to try to silence his screaming.\n\nDuring the second week of his capture, Stoops asked Berdella for a soft drink and sandwich. When Berdella refused, Stoops burst into tears. On June 27, he ruptured Stoops' anal wall with his fist, causing bleeding and discharge. Towards the end of Stoops's captivity, he tried to feed his captive ice cream and soup, although Stoops \"wasn't able to keep anything down\". By the final day of his captivity, Stoops was so weak Berdella later stated he had been unable \"to breathe in a sitting position\". On July 1, 1986, Stoops died; a forensic pathologist later testified that the ruptured anal wall caused septic shock which proved fatal.\n\nIn the spring of 1987, Berdella became friendly with a 20-year-old named Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both witchcraft and wizardry. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home as a means of paying rent. According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture this individual, but formed the plan to do so on June 23 when, having bailed Pearson out of jail, the young man began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in Wichita. That evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became intoxicated before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson's hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson's larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an electrical transformer to the basement.\n\nAccording to Berdella, Pearson was by far the most cooperative of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an iron rod to render him submissive, Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse; as a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he (Berdella) would not continue to inflict as much pain upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, in order that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or being returned to the basement.\n\nAfter six weeks of captivity, in an act of despair, Pearson deeply bit into Berdella's penis before screaming he could not continue to tolerate being treated in this manner. In response, Berdella killed Pearson by first bludgeoning him into unconsciousness with a tree limb, then suffocating him with a bag and ligature, before driving to hospital to receive treatment for his wound. Pearson's body was later dismembered in the basement, and his head initially stored in a plastic bag inside Berdella's freezer, before being buried in the backyard.\nAt 1:00 a.m. on March 29, 1988, Berdella abducted his last victim, a 22-year-old male prostitute named Christopher Bryson, whom he lured to his house upon the promise of payment for sex. At Berdella's home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella's bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson's case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed his eyes with ammonia, before exclaiming to him: \"The only things you need to think about are you, me, and this house.\"\n\nAfter several days, Berdella explained to Bryson he had begun to \"trust\" his captive, and that although he was willing to discuss aspects of the abuse and torture he was receiving, there would be no negotiations pertaining to his sexual abuse. Berdella finished this discussion with a stern warning: \"I've gotten this far with other people before, and they're dead now, because of mistakes they made.\"\n\nBy the third day of his capture, Bryson had earned sufficient trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a daily regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.\n\nBryson then managed to escape from the house by jumping from a second floor window, wearing nothing besides a dog collar around his neck, breaking a bone in his foot in the process; he then ran toward a meter reader walking across the other side of the street, shouting for this individual to call the police. This individual led Bryson to the house he had been approaching, whereupon the occupants promptly called the police, who arrived minutes later.\n\nQuestioned at the scene by four officers, Bryson initially claimed he had been hitchhiking when abducted by Berdella, who had kidnapped, raped, and tortured him for four days before he had managed to escape by jumping from a window on the second floor of the property. Furthermore, this individual had kept him bound to a bed on the second floor of the house throughout much of the time he had been held against his will, repeatedly sodomizing him, drugging him, and injecting his throat with drain cleaner to diminish his ability to speak loudly. As Bryson spoke, the officers also noted that in addition to the dog collar and broken foot, Bryson had red, swollen eyes, and visible scars and welts across his entire body. Two officers were told to maintain a discreet surveillance of the property, as Bryson was driven to the Menorah Medical Center, accompanied by a third officer, for treatment as the fourth officer radioed the Kansas City Police Department to request a formal search warrant of the property be drafted.\n\nLater questioned in greater detail at the Kansas City Police Department, Bryson again stated he had been held against his will by the occupant of 4315 Charlotte Street, who had subjected him to four days of repeated sexual abuse, humiliation, and torture. Bryson further divulged that this individual had also shown him Polaroid images of men who appeared to be deceased, with the explanation these had been previous individuals he had unsuccessfully attempted to \"collect\" as his sexual slaves. Furthermore, this individual had informed Bryson he had no intention of ever allowing him to leave his property, and that he had claimed to have killed the previous individuals he had captured and treated in this manner, and that if he (Bryson) became a nuisance or threat to him, he would either be subjected to greater levels of torture than what he had already endured, or simply killed.\n\nOn the afternoon of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims of having been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom on the second floor was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts at the foot of the bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops were also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.\n\nSearching elsewhere in the house and grounds of 4315 Charlotte Street, investigators uncovered a human skull inside a closet on the second floor of his property, and a partially decomposed human head in the backyard. The search also uncovered several human vertebrae scarred by both hacksaw and knife marks stowed in a hallway, and several human teeth stowed in two envelopes. Both a hacksaw and a miter saw were discovered in the basement of the property, and a chainsaw was also found to be soiled with bloodstains, flesh, and pubic hairs. Luminol tests revealed that the floor of Berdella's basement, and two plastic trash barrels, were extensively bloodstained.\n\nA total of 334 Polaroid pictures and 34 snapshot prints of various male individuals were also found stowed in various locations within Berdella's house; these images depicted Christopher Bryson and several other individuals both in life and in death, and many of the images had been taken as the subjects had been tortured. The search also uncovered numerous restraining and sexual devices; pornographic literature; hypodermic needles; and a book devoted to the creation and remedies of narcotics. Atop a chest of drawers in one bedroom, officers discovered a stenographer's pad containing the detailed torture logs he had maintained for each victim, several newspaper clippings from \"The Kansas City Star\" regarding a missing young man named Jerry Howell, and both a wallet and a driving license belonging to a missing person named James Ferris was discovered in a closet on the second floor of the property.\n\nBefore the search of Berdella's property had concluded, the Kansas City Police Department assembled a special task force of 11 detectives and one sergeant to focus exclusively on Berdella's case. This task force extensively researched Berdella's history, discovering that he was a well-known individual among Kansas City's male hustlers, having earned a reputation for preying on transient young men. Several of these male prostitutes were also reluctant to accept him as a client both because of his penchant for drugging, injecting, and torturing his sexual partners and acquaintances, and also because he had long been considered a suspect in the disappearance of the two men whose personal possessions had been found in his house (Jerry Howell and James Ferris). Missing person reports had been filed in relation to both these men, and Berdella had been extensively questioned in relation to both of these disappearances. In both instances, he had denied having anything to do with the individual's disappearance. Despite being considered a prime suspect in both cases, and being placed under surveillance, police had been unable to find any solid evidence linking him to either man's disappearance, and in both instances, after giving his initial statement to police, Berdella had indignantly refused to talk further without a lawyer present. He would later have his lawyer threaten to file harassment accusations against police unless their questioning and surveillance of him ceased.\n\nJames Ferris's wife identified him in several instant photos found at Berdella's property; some taken after her husband's death. Paul Howell formally identified one picture of a young man hanging upside down in Berdella's basement as depicting his son. Several other Polaroid images depicted as-yet unidentified young men, and several detectives were assigned the task of identifying each individual depicted to determine if he was alive or dead, and if alive, the circumstances surrounding his depiction. As several of these images depicted a section of the body of the individual who had taken the photograph, on April 13, Berdella was ordered to pose nude for a series of photographs in order that portions of his body could be photographed in the precise angle depicted within these images for comparison with the original Polaroid images.\n\nAs numerous male names had been found scrawled upon various stenographer's pads at Berdella's address, the detectives began attempting to trace each individual. One of these individuals traced, a young man named Freddie Kellogg, was able to state to detectives he and several other young men had intermittently lodged with Berdella since the early 1980s, and that he (Berdella) had been in the habit of plying his lodgers with drugs—typically intravenously—before engaging in sex with them regardless of whether they consented or not. Kellogg also stated Berdella had expressly stated that a condition of his lodging with him was for Kellogg to persuade young men whom he (Berdella) found attractive to attend parties at Charlotte Street in order that Berdella could drug them. Should Berdella ever discover any of these individuals was a police informant, he would use this knowledge as a tool in which he could blackmail the individual to his own advantage. In spite of this condition of his living with Berdella, Kellogg further stated that numerous male prostitutes and addicts had been reluctant to engage in any form of contact with Berdella because of rumors regarding his links to the 1984 disappearance of Jerry Howell.\n\nIn addition to these disclosures, Kellogg was able to name three of the individuals depicted in the Polaroids as being Todd Stoops, Robert Sheldon, and Larry Wayne Pearson. These investigators would shortly discover Berdella had paid a $30 fee to secure a bond for Pearson in June 1987 (), and that no further records existed to indicate Pearson was still alive. Nonetheless, investigators did discover that, in August 1987, Berdella had filed an assault report from a hospital room in which he alleged a man named \"Larry Person\" had deeply bitten his penis during oral sex, causing a serious laceration. An interview with Robert Sheldon's employers at a Kansas City manufacturing plant had confirmed the young man had been a reliable employee of theirs, but that he had suddenly ceased attending work in April 1985.\n\nShortly after the search of 4315 Charlotte Street had concluded, Berdella was informed of the discoveries at his property. The same afternoon he was ordered to pose for the series of nude photographs for comparison with the Polaroid images he had taken, investigators attempted to conduct their first formal investigation with him, although Berdella simply invoked his right to silence in this setting. (Investigators later sought to obtain handwriting samples from Berdella in an effort to prove he had written the notes found within the various stenographer's pads discovered at his house; he refused to cooperate and was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court.)\n\nBerdella was initially formally charged with one count of felonious restraint, one count of assault, and seven counts of forcible sodomy, as investigators continued their investigations into the discoveries at his property, and formally compiled further charges against him. He was assigned a temporary public defender as his legal representative, and held in protective custody in a Jackson County jail in lieu of $500,000 bail ().\n\nIn late April, the skull found inside Berdella's closet was identified via dental X-rays obtained via subpoena from the University of Kansas Medical Center as that of Robert Sheldon. The same day a dental identification was made upon Sheldon's skull, two men separately phoned the Kansas City Police Department to state one of seven unidentified young men depicted in a photographic array released to the media on April 27 was a former high school acquaintance of theirs named Mark Wallace. When a detective traced Wallace's sister, she stated her brother had been missing since mid-1985. Shortly thereafter, investigators discovered that photograph \"D\" released to the media in this same array was one Larry Wayne Pearson. As Pearson had once been a ward of the court in Wichita, his dental records were discovered and compared with the skull found in Berdella's backyard.\n\nBerdella would be formally charged with the murder by dismemberment of Larry Wayne Pearson in July after the head discovered in his backyard was formally identified as that of Pearson on May 12, and prosecutors had gathered sufficient circumstantial evidence to accompany the physical evidence retrieved.\n\nOn July 22, 1988, a grand jury formally indicted Berdella for the murder of Larry Wayne Pearson. The following month, he was arraigned and pleaded guilty in the 4th Circuit of the Jackson County Court before Judge Alvin C. Randall to the first degree murder of Larry Pearson. The plea was entered following a late-morning recess in the arraignment hearing into this particular murder, and came as a surprise to both the judge, and prosecuting attorneys. The prosecution team assigned to the case accepted the plea, with assistant prosecutor Pat Hall later explaining this decision as being \"in the best interest of our client, [and] the people of the state of Missouri\".\n\nFollowing the submission and acceptance of this plea, the judge insisted that Berdella confess under oath as to Pearson's death. In response to questioning by his attorneys, Berdella stated: \"I put a plastic bag over his head, and tied it with rope and allowed him to suffocate.\" When asked if he performed this act deliberately, and with malice aforethought, Berdella simply stated, \"Yes.\" He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Upon being sentenced, Berdella was transferred to the Missouri State Penitentiary, to commence his life sentence. He would later be temporarily placed in protective custody at the Potosi Correctional Center, due to concerns for his safety.\n\nA second guilty plea submitted before the Jackson County Court on August 24 earned Berdella a further life term without parole for one charge of forcible sodomy against Christopher Bryson (six counts of sodomy and one charge of assault being dropped as part of a plea bargain); he would also receive a further term of seven years pertaining to one count of felonious restraint against Bryson on this date.\n\nDespite initially pleading not guilty to the remaining five murder charges on September 13, 1988, with the agreement of his two defense attorneys, Berdella ultimately conducted a plea bargain with the prosecutors to avoid the death penalty in these remaining charges. In this plea bargain, Berdella agreed to confess in graphic detail as to precisely whom he had killed, precisely what indignities he had subjected each victim to, how he had killed each victim, and what he had done with their bodies. These confessions were given to prosecutors between December 13 and December 15, 1988. In return for his cooperation, the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty at a formal hearing scheduled for 9 a.m on December 19.\n\nOn December 19, 1988, Berdella formally waived his rights to be tried for any of the outstanding murder charges, upon the understanding he was to be convicted of one further count of first degree murder (that of Robert Sheldon), and four counts of second degree murder. He formally pleaded guilty to each of these charges before Judge Robert Meyers in the Jackson County Circuit Court. Members of the public were prohibited from attending this hearing, with only family members of his victims and news reporters permitted access to the proceedings. In response to these guilty pleas, Judge Meyers imposed five further concurrent life sentences, with an additional condition barring any future prospect of parole in the sole case of first degree murder to which he pleaded guilty.\n\nIn the testimony Berdella provided to prosecutors between December 13 and 15 when he had changed his mind as to his plea and sought approval upon their agreement not to seek the death penalty against him if he fully confessed, Berdella claimed the movie he had first seen in 1965, \"The Collector\", had left a major impression on him and that, following the senses of shock and disgust he claimed to have initially experienced after killing his first victim, had resurfaced in his memory and subsequently became a motivating psychological force in the actions he exhibited against his victims in his subsequent murders. His victims, he stated to investigators, had lost any degree of humanity in his eyes once he had chosen to render them captive.\n\nIn reference to the coded notations within the actual torture logs, Berdella confessed that many of the abbreviated entries were simply shorthand terms for methods of abuse he had inflicted upon his victims, whereas others would describe either their reactions to these ongoing acts of abuse and torture, or his initial observations upon viewing them when he entered the room where he had kept them restrained. The entry reading \"CP\", for example, had referred to the injections of chlorpromazine he had injected into his victims to assist in his restraining them, whereas entries reading \"DC\" would refer to the swabbing of their eyes with drain cleaner or the injection of the substance into their vocal cords. Entries reading \"EK\" or \"EKG\" had referred to the method of torture administered to his captives with electrical shots, whereas several other entries also contained the anatomical location where Berdella had administered the abuse or torture to his victims. For example, at one point in relation to victim James Ferris, Berdella had written an entry reading: \"2 1/2 ket nk + shoulder\" to indicate he had injected 2.2 cubic centimeters of ketamine into his victim's neck and shoulder. Other entries such as \"gag loose, no resist in retie\" or \"very delayed breathing, snoring\" were more self-explanatory. (Investigators had consulted a specialist in toxicology in their investigation into Berdella following his arrest. This individual had stated that, judging by the notes he had written upon victim Robert Sheldon, the accumulation of chlorpromazine injected into this victim had been toxic.)\n\nFurthermore, Berdella confessed to having alternately buried the two victims' heads in his backyard, adding that he had retrieved and cleaned the first skull—that of Robert Sheldon—at the time he had buried victim Larry Pearson's head in the same hole. Sheldon's skull was that which he had placed inside a closet on the second floor of his property, in an area of the household Berdella referred to as \"my gallery area\", with the teeth removed and stowed inside envelopes in the same room, and that he had intended to retrieve Pearson's skull once sufficient time had elapsed for it to skeletonize, although he was adamant there had been no rational or sinister reason for his doing so. In addition, he vehemently denied media rumors that he had been engaged in any form of satanism, or that he had sold sections of his victims' bodies at his flea market booth.\n\nBerdella was able to name all of his victims to investigators. Although one victim (Mark Wallace) had been seized by opportunity when he had discovered him seeking shelter from a severe thunderstorm in his tool shed, his other five victims had been captured after he had unsuccessfully tried to steer them away from their general lifestyles, and had thus simply become frustrated at the failure of his efforts. Upon each victim's capture, Berdella described in graphic detail the sexual, physical and emotional abuse he had subjected the victim to, and which he had recorded within his torture logs. He tersely explained his successive actions to investigators on December 14 with the statement that he was \"capturing them first, and what developed developed.\" Nonetheless, he did claim that he had tried to prevent any of his victims from developing any form of malnutrition or infection by occasionally administering antibiotics, or nutrients intravenously as his abuse and torture escalated.\n\nThe methods of torture exhibited against his victims had included the administration of high-voltage electrical shocks, the starvation of his captive, the application of alkali-based detergents to their throats, vocal cords, or eyes, and the bludgeoning of their hands with the intention of rendering these body parts unusable. One other method of torture had been the insertion of needles beneath their fingernails. Furthermore, Berdella confessed that the level of abuse he inflicted had increased with each successive victim, and he had viewed the Polaroid images he had taken of his victims as being a \"trophy or record of the event\".\n\nAlthough police had extensively searched for the remains of Berdella's victims throughout their initial investigation into his crimes, the confession Berdella provided to investigators in the autumn of 1988 had confirmed the dismembered bodies of all six of his victims had been stowed in trash bags and subsequently taken to a landfill. Consequently, their bodies were never recovered.\nIn the years following his 1988 convictions and incarceration, Berdella both granted an interview to the Kansas-based television station \"KCPT\", and corresponded with numerous individuals. To all concerned, he attempted to restore his image as a \"sensitive citizen\" who had simply \"made mistakes\" in committing his crimes. He further claimed he had been unfairly demonized by the media before, during, and after his arraignments and plea bargains, and that police ineptitude had resulted in his being allowed to remain at liberty following his first murder.\n\nBerdella also lodged several complaints with prison officials regarding prison conditions. He had also written several letters to a local minister claiming that prison officials knew of his high blood pressure, yet were not providing him with his prescribed heart medication.\n\nIn 1992, Robert Berdella contacted the counselor he met when first incarcerated, Rev. Roger Coleman. He informed Coleman of his distress due to staff at the Missouri State Penitentiary withholding his heart medication.\n\nAt 2:00 p.m. on October 8, 1992, Berdella complained to prison staff of heart pains, and was taken from his cell to the prison infirmary. Medical staff determined his heart was unstable and called an ambulance. Berdella was taken to a hospital in Columbia, Missouri, where he was pronounced dead from a heart attack at 3:55 p.m. He was 43 years old.\n\nShortly after Berdella's death, the judge at his trial, Alvin Randall, was informed of his passing. In response, Randall sarcastically remarked: \"Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.\"\n\nAccording to published reports, although Berdella suffered from a depressive personality disorder, he was also a diagnosed sexual sadist who gained extreme sexual excitation from the humiliation, pain and torture he had submitted his victims to. Moreover, despite his claims to media individuals whom he had contacted in the years of his incarceration, he had never expressed any degree of remorse for his actions, and would tersely refer to his victims as \"play toys\" in an interview he granted shortly before his death.\n\n\nBy the time of Berdella's April 1988 arrest, he had abducted, tortured and murdered at least six young men (although the Kansas City Police Department suspect Berdella of involvement in two other disappearances). In addition, despite the fact that more than 20 different men had been depicted in postures suggesting unconsciousness or death within the 334 Polaroid images and 34 snaphot prints seized from 4315 Charlotte Street following his arrest, Berdella was adamant the six individuals identified as victims and which he had confessed to killing were all those he had killed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6463575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6463575", "title": "Roman-Dutch law", "text": "Roman-Dutch law\n\nRoman-Dutch law (Dutch: \"Rooms-Hollands recht\", Afrikaans: \"Romeins-Hollandse reg\") is an uncodified, scholarship-driven, judge-made legal system based on Roman law as applied in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries. As such, it is a variety of the European continental civil law or \"ius commune\". While Roman-Dutch law was superseded by Napoleonic codal law in the Netherlands proper as early as the beginning of the 19th century, Roman-Dutch law is still applied by the courts of South Africa (and its neighbours Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe), Guyana, Indonesia, East Timor, and Sri Lanka. It was largely drawn upon by Scots law. It also had some minor impact on the laws of the American state of New York, especially in introducing the office of Prosecutor (\"schout-fiscaal\").\n\nRoman law was progressively abandoned during the early Middle Ages. The Theodosian Code and excerpts of latter-day imperial enactments (\"constitutiones\") were well known in the successor Germanic states and vital to maintaining the commonplace principle of folk-right which applied pre-existing Roman law to Roman provincials and Germanic law to Germans. The \"Breviary of Alaric\" and the \"Lex Gundobada Romana\" are two of the several hybrid Romano-Germanic law codes that incorporated much Roman legal material. However, because the fall of the Western Roman Empire preceded the drafting of the Justinianic Code, early Byzantine law was never influential in Western Europe. Also, much of this early law was superseded by later feudal law. Only canon law successfully retained any substantial amount of Roman law to be influential.\n\nInterest in the doctrines of Byzantine lawyers came when—around the year 1070—a copy of the \"Digest\" of Emperor Justinian I found its way into northern Italy. Scholars in the emerging University of Bologna, who previously had access to only a limited portion of the Justinianic code, sparked an intellectual rediscovery of Roman law through the teaching of law based on Byzantine law texts. Courts gradually applied Byzantine law—as taught in Bologna (and soon elsewhere)—first as law \"in subsidium\" to be applied when there was no local statute or custom in point, and later because judicial officers (judges, magistrates, assessors) felt that its refined legal concepts were more apt to solve complex cases than the customary laws of western and central Europe. This process, referred to as reception, took place in the Holy Roman Empire and the Mediterranean in the 13th-14th centuries, but was much slower to come to northern Europe (e.g., Saxony, Northern France, the Low Countries, Scandinavia).\n\nIn the 15th century, reception \"in complexu\" reached the Netherlands while it was associated with the Holy Roman Empire. While Italian lawyers (\"mos italicus\") were the first to contribute to the new Byzantine-based jurisprudence, in the 16th century, French humanistic doctrinal scholars (\"mos gallicus\") were most influential. In the 17th and 18th century, it was the Dutch who had the greatest influence. Members of the \"Hollandse Elegante School\" (“school of elegant jurisprudence”; 1500–1800) included Hugo Grotius, Johannes Voet, Ulrich Huber, Gerard Noodt, J. and F. van de Sande, and many others. These scholars managed to merge Roman law with legal concepts taken from traditional Dutch feudal customary law, especially from the province of Holland. The resulting mixture was predominantly Roman, but it contained some features which were characteristically Dutch: this hybrid is known as Roman-Dutch law. The Dutch applied their legal system in their colonial empire. In so doing, the distinctly Dutch branch of civil law (or \"ius commune\") came to be applied in far-flung places, e.g., the Dutch East Indies, Dutch West Indies, Cape Colony, and Dutch Ceylon.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Roman-Dutch law abruptly ended when, in 1809, the Dutch puppet state—the Kingdom of Holland—adopted the French Napoleonic Code, a different system but nonetheless a branch of civil law. Yet, in the then-Dutch colonies, French law was never introduced during or after the Napoleonic era. As a result, Roman-Dutch law has managed to survive, usually in a hybrid form mixed with English law, otherwise known as “Anglo-Dutch law”.\n\nThe Netherlands participated in international seminars and training programmes organized by international partner organisations, ranging from a two-day seminar to a two-week programme for different legal professionals around the world. Programmes have been developed for Surinam, Aruba, Sint Maarten and Indonesia.\n\n\n"}

There is a convention, in political and philosophical fields of thought, to have \"modern\" and \"classical\" schools of thought. An example is the modern and classical liberals. This dichotomy is often a component of paradigm shift. However, it is rarely the case that there are only two schools in any given field.\n\nSchools are often named after their founders such as the \"Rinzai school\" of Zen, named after Linji Yixuan; and the Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy, named after Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari. They are often also named after their places of origin, such as the Ionian school of philosophy, which originated in Ionia; the Chicago school of architecture, which originated in Chicago, Illinois; the Prague school of linguistics, named after a linguistic circle founded in Prague; and the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School, whose representatives lived in Tartu and Moscow.\n\n"}
{"id": "49546992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49546992", "title": "Self mentoring", "text": "Self mentoring\n\n'Self-mentoring' is a process which requires you to assemble a realistic, accurate assessment of yourself (strengths and weaknesses) with the goal of crafting your ‘ideal self’ to heighten job performance, career progression, or personal ambitions. This practice, suitable for any age, profession, gender, race, or ability, is a four-stage framework which includes: self-awareness, self-development, self-reflection, and self-monitoring.\n\nThe term self-mentoring is a registered trademark and owned by the author. You cannot own a copyright on a registered trademark. \n\nIn self-mentoring, YOU initiate responsibility for self-development by allocating time and commitment navigating your surroundings and organizing an environment where you lead personal and professional growth. Self-mentors identify and develop individual skills that align with internal and external resources to meet expectations using social and professional networks when needed (Carr, 2015). Leadership is a process, not an innate or taught set of skills (Lambert, 2003). Lambert, a scholar in leadership development, reveals supervision to include problem solving, broad-based and skillful participation, co-worker collaboration, and on-task performance. Those who aspire leadership positions need a structured approach to reach their full leadership potential (Bond & Hargreaves, 2014).\n\nAssimilating employees into an organization is a critical role for leaders (Lambert, 2003). Commitment from the employees as well as the supervisor is equally important. In 1999, Oakes, Quartz, Ryan, and Lipton stated, and it still holds true today, that unless there is commitment by those involved in change and growth, reigning behaviors will return. Self-mentors are devoted and passionate in sustaining their success. A sense of accomplishment is motivational enough for them to continue their endeavor and maintain personal empowerment and self-efficacy (Bond & Hargreaves, 2014). Beckford (2012) agrees with the influence of self-mentoring to one’s position of personal power and ownership. You take control of your life as you journey on a path that is right for you.\n\nSelf-mentoring strengthens the existing culture in an organization. Barth (1999) views leadership as everyone’s work. Leaders grow when engaged with others to make sense of the world, reach out to new hires, commit to shared results, and develop identities as owners of their system - the organization. Self-mentoring provides a framework to welcome new employees, while also offering leadership opportunities to seasoned workers ready to step into supervisory roles. These positions may include administrative roles, responsibilities serving new employees, or a change in career direction.\n\nThe benefits of using methods in self-mentoring when acclimating to new positions are abundant. This is especially true in the university setting. Academic professions are often self-directed within the domains of performance guidelines, review procedures, and promotion decisions employed by the university. Research suggests there is heightened self-esteem and self-efficacy with the application of self-mentoring practices. This, in turn, enhances connection and commitment to the institution (Bond & Hargreaves, 2014).\n\nTo understand ways an individual can adapt to and apply self-mentoring skills, the following personal example illustrates this process. This case involves an instructor in higher education.\n\nThe detailed concept of self-mentoring (with all 4 levels embedded) was born as a result of a superintendent's adversities transitioning into higher education position. She found her new work at a university overwhelming as a disconnect persisted between her and her assigned mentor. While her mentor was more than proficient in ability and expertise, their mentor/mentee relationship struggled and wasn’t serving its purpose. Through the complexity of this experience, self-mentoring evolved as a tool the faculty member clung to and crafted in order to survive her new role.\n\nIn developing the process of self-mentoring, the new employee drew upon her innate as well as learned leadership skills and competencies. She established a plan for survival that involved setting expectations, forming strategies, gathering and analyzing data, networking, and monitoring progress. Pleased with her success at the end her first year, she continued her job and more importantly began sharing her methods she fittingly named, ‘self-mentoring’ (Carr, 2015). The basic tenet leading this concept is ‘You are your own best mentor’ (Bond & Hargreaves, 2014). Kimberly Horn (2013) explains there will always be times in one’s career when the right mentor-mentee match simply doesn’t happen. This is when self-mentoring becomes the perfect option for acclimating to the change(s) and growing personally and professionally as a result.\n\nFor this retired superintendent, the shift into a role of university practitioner was met with obstacles she surmounted through the process of self-mentoring. After the creation and follow-through of this practice, this professor was honored with three prestigious academic awards. Self-mentoring has now moved beyond the field of education and impacted weight loss programs, student leadership, mentoring, and executive coaching experiences (Carr, 2015).\n\nCoaching, mentoring, and self-mentoring have parallel, yet exclusive characteristics. Each system or combination of systems has value for establishments. An organization is a living, breathing, and ever-changing system of interlocked subcultures. Individuals immersed in a new environment require skills to navigate through what can be treacherous waters. (Schein, 2010) This system is a network of interdependent components that work together to accomplish the goals of an organization (Lezotte & McKee, 2002), and individuals must grasp the system they are surrounded by in order to perform appropriately in it. They must identify explicit or implied expectations from the environment. This can be challenging for even the most experienced. Coaching, mentoring, and self-mentoring support individuals navigating within this environment, while each has a unique approach that must be aligned with the needs of the individual and the organization. Central to all three of these practices is the idea of self-development (Huang & Lynch, 1995). Each practice advocates for the personal and/or professional development of an individual.\n\nThere are four levels of self-mentoring. Each level builds on the other.\n\n\nThe following chart illustrates the steps involved in all four levels of self-mentoring.\n\nThere are ten major steps aligned to each of the four levels of self-mentoring. Here is a chart listing the steps involved. At times, these steps may overlap among the four levels.\n\nHere is a description to accompany each step in the process of self-mentoring.\n\nRecognize and identify talents and challenges in your environment, the people in your environment, and YOURSELF.\n\nIdentify an expectation after compiling a list of potential options. Write down the expectation, so others can understand it if they read it.\n\nOnce you have your expectation, develop a measurable strategy(s). A strategy is an activity that can be used to gather data.\n\nThe strategy must be measurable either quantitatively, qualitatively or through a mixture of both. You may count for frequency or observe for behaviors.\n\nEstablish a timeline to collect data. Include a starting and ending date. Plan each day or week as you implement the strategy. Collect data until you reach the end of your timeline.\n\nCollect data from your activities. It may be you watching a video and taking notes, or a comparison of your notes with your colleagues’ feedback of the same video.\n\nConsider an internal and external networking team. Reach out to experts in the field for advice, and/or just a few trusting peers for feedback and reflection time.\n\nOnce data is collected and feedback is available, reflect on what the data is saying. What does it mean?\n\nReflect upon what you have learned and apply it to the situation to test your solutions. Did it work? Why or why not?\n\nMonitor your accomplishment. Develop a periodic status check. Consider starting a new expectation and repeating the process.\n\nWhile self-mentoring moves to the forefront as a useful self-improvement practice, it has established a noteworthy presence. This has been shown in isolation or in combination with mentoring and/or coaching methods. It may not serve everyone, but it does serve the majority of individuals who are motivated to take control and lead using a common sense approach to self-leadership. Self-mentoring draws on organizational skills that we all recognize yet often forget we possess until needed. Self-mentoring builds confidence in your ability to lead. After all, it is your life; you should lead!\n\nBarth, R. S. (2001). Teacher leader. Phi Delta Kappan, 82(6).\n\nBeckford, A. (April, 2012).

It refers to:\n\n\nAccording to the Iliad, the goal of all men of honour in archaic Greece was to \"always be the first and superior to the others\". This ideal was called the \"aristeuein\"- or \"aristeia\"-Ideal. In Homer's days, this ideal was mainly based on performance skills in speaking and fighting, and included wisdom, self-restraint, loyalty, and bravery (e.g., leading armies in the front row). For decades, prestige, which was a requisite for might, originated in speaking ability and military virtues. This is true for the cases of both Solon and Peisistratos by Herodotus and by Aristotle in the \"Athenaion Politeia\". In addition, success at the Olympic Games, especially in the field of four-horse chariot racing, was a peaceful way to gain prestige.\n\nSince ancient Athens before Solon did not have a fixed state order or instruments of power that belonged only to the state, the aristocrats could compete violently for office and property. As a result, as methods became more and more violent, aristocrats and their \"oikoi\" (families and followers) were engaged in civil strife against each other. At the beginning of the 6th century, the situation worsened, so that the aristocrats of Athens made Solon a lawmaker and arbitrator. The result was the Solonic Reforms. From then on, the term \"tyrannos\" (tyrant) became increasingly connected with violence and lawless might, a development which was fruitful only after the death of Solon's successor, the \"tyrannos\" Peisistratos.\n\nAfter Solon's retirement from Athenian politics, the struggle for might continued, because the Athenian society wasn't ready for a fixed state order yet. Under Peisistratos' regime, the \"stasis\" continued, but only for charges under the tyrant, thus both securing him by appeasing the other aristocrats, and accustoming them to fixed charges given by a ruler, which paved the way for the reforms of Cleisthenes. Thus, aristocrats like Callias and Cimon had to struggle for prestige by winning in Olympia or showing off their wealth, not by becoming tyrants, while Miltiades the Elder emigrated from Athens and became head of a colony.\n\n"}
{"id": "19224766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19224766", "title": "Suspicion (emotion)", "text": "Suspicion (emotion)\n\nSuspicion is a cognition of mistrust in which a person doubts the honesty of another person or believes another person to be guilty of some type of wrongdoing or crime, but without sure proof. Suspicion can also be aroused in response to objects that negatively differ from an expected idea. In the US, the courts use the term \"reasonable suspicion\" in connection with the right of the police to stop people on the street. The word comes from Middle-English via the Old French word \"suspicion\", which is a variation of the Italian word \"sospetto\" (a derivative of the Latin term \"suspectio\", which means \"to watch\").\n\nEnglish philosopher, statesman, and author Francis Bacon (1561–1626) wrote an essay entitled \"Of Suspicion\", in which he stated that suspicions need to be repressed and well-guarded, because otherwise they will cloud the mind, and cause a ruler to move towards tyranny, due to the fear that his subjects are conspiring against him, and a husband to become jealous and fearful of his wife's interactions with other men. Bacon argued that the root of suspicion was a lack of knowledge; as such, the remedy to suspicion was to learn more about the issue that is troubling you. If a husband is concerned about his wife's male friends, he should ask her about the nature of these friendships, and state his concerns, rather than building up his suspicions. Bacon urged people who were harbouring suspicions to be frank with the people that they were suspecting, and clear the matter up.\n\nThe British dramatist William Shakespeare noted that \"suspicion always haunts the guilty mind\". English Renaissance dramatist, poet and actor Ben Jonson (1572–1637), a contemporary of Shakespeare, described suspicion as a \"black poison\" that \"infects the human mind like a plague\". Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), an English author and essayist,\ncalled suspicion a \"useless pain\" in which a person has a belief that a formidable evil lies within all of their fellow men. The Scottish poet and a lyricist Robert Burns (1759–1796) called suspicion a \"heavy armour\" that impedes humans more than it protects them. Mahatma Gandhi, the political and spiritual leader of the non-violent Indian independence movement, warned that if suspicions arise about any of a person's motives, then all of their acts can become tainted with this mistrust and uncertainty.\n\n"}
{"id": "4708379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4708379", "title": "Trikaya", "text": "Trikaya\n\nThe Trikāya doctrine (Sanskrit, literally \"three bodies\"; , ) is a Mahayana Buddhist teaching on both the nature of reality and the nature of Buddhahood.\n\nThe doctrine says that a Buddha has three \"kāyas\" or \"bodies\":\n\nEven before the Buddha's parinirvāṇa, the term \"Dhammakāya\" was current. Dhammakāya literally means \"Truth body\".\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha tells Vasettha that the Tathāgata (the Buddha) is the Dhammakāya, the 'Truth-body' or the 'Embodiment of Truth', as well as \"Dhammabhūta\", 'Truth-become', 'One who has become Truth' \n\nThe Buddha is equated with the Dhamma: \"[T]he Buddha comforts him, 'Enough, Vakkali. Why do you want to see this filthy body? Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me; whoever sees me sees the Dhamma.'\"\n\nIn the \"Aggañña Sutta\", the Buddha advises Vasettha that whoever has strong, deep rooted, and established belief in the Tathagatha, he can declare that he is the child of Bhagavan, born from the mouth of Dhamma, created from Dhamma, and the heir of Dhamma. Because the titles of the Tathagatha are: The Body of Dhamma, The Body of Brahma, the Manifestation of Dhamma, and the Manifestation of Brahma.\n\nThe Dharmakāya doctrine was possibly first expounded in the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā\" \"The Perfection of Wisdom In Eight Thousand Verses\", composed in the 1st century BCE.\n\nMahayana Buddhism introduced the Sambhogakāya, which conceptually fits between the Nirmāṇakāya (the manifestations of enlightenment in the physical world) and the Dharmakaya. The Sambhogakaya is that aspect of the Buddha, or the Dharma, that one meets in visions and in deep meditation. It could be considered an interface with the Dharmakaya.\n\nThe Trikaya-doctrine and the Buddha-nature bring the transcendental within reach, by placing the transcendental within the plane of immanence.\n\nAround 300 CE, the Yogacara school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the Trikaya or \"three-body doctrine\".\n\nSchools have different ideas about what the three bodies are.\n\nThe Three Bodies of the Buddha from the point of view of Pure Land Buddhist thought can be broken down like so:\n\n\nAs with earlier Buddhist thought, all three forms of the Buddha teach the same Dharma, but take on different forms to expound the truth.\n\nAccording to Schloegl, in the \"Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu\", the Three Bodies of the Buddha are not taken as absolute. They would be \"mental configurations\" that \"are merely names or props\" and would only perform a role of light and shadow of the mind.\n\nThe \"Zhenzhou Linji Huizhao Chansi Yulu\" advises:\n\nVajrayana sometimes refers to a fourth body called the \"svābhāvikakāya\" () \"essential body\", and to a fifth body, called the mahāsūkhakāya (, \"great bliss body\"). The svābhāvikakāya is simply the unity or non-separateness of the three kayas.\n\nThe term is also known in Gelug teachings, where it is one of the assumed two aspects of the dharmakāya: \"svābhāvikakāya\" \"essence body\" and jñānakāya \"body of wisdom\".\n\nHaribhadra claims that the \"Abhisamayalankara\" describes Buddhahood through four kāyas in chapter 8: svābhāvikakāya, [jñāna]dharmakāya, sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya.\n\nIn dzogchen teachings, \"dharmakaya\" means the buddha-nature's absence of self-nature, that is, its emptiness of a conceptualizable essence, its cognizance or clarity is the sambhogakaya, and the fact that its capacity is 'suffused with self-existing awareness' is the nirmanakaya.\n\nThe interpretation in Mahamudra is similar: When the mahamudra practices come to fruition, one sees that the mind and all phenomena are fundamentally empty of any identity; this emptiness is called \"dharmakāya\". One perceives that the essence of mind is empty, but that it also has a potentiality that takes the form of luminosity. In Mahamudra thought, Sambhogakāya is understood to be this luminosity. Nirmanakāya is understood to be the powerful force with which the potentiality affects living beings.\n\nIn the view of Anuyoga, the Mind Stream (Sanskrit: \"citta santana\") is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: \"santana\"; Wylie: \"rgyud\") that links the Trikaya. The Trikāya, as a triune, is symbolised by the Gankyil.\n\nA ḍākinī ( \"khandro[ma]\") is a tantric deity described as a female embodiment of enlightened energy. The Sanskrit term is likely related to the term for drumming, while the Tibetan term means \"sky goer\" and may have originated in the Sanskrit \"khecara\", a term from the \"Cakrasaṃvara Tantra\".\n\nḌākinīs can also be classified according to the trikāya theory. The dharmakāya ḍākinī, which is Samantabhadrī, represents the dharmadhatu where all phenomena appear. The sambhogakāya ḍākinī are the yidams used as meditational deities for tantric practice. The nirmanakaya ḍākinīs are human women born with special potentialities; these are realized yogini, the consorts of the gurus, or even all women in general as they may be classified into the families of the Five Tathagatas.\n\nTheosophy, a Western esoteric school founded in the 19th century, regards Buddhism as containing esoteric teachings. In those supposed esoteric teachings of Buddhism, \"exoteric Buddhism\" believes that Nirmanakaya simple means the physical body of Buddha. According to the esoteric interpretation, when the Buddha dies he assumes the Nirmanakaya, instead of going into Nirvana. He remains in that glorious body he has woven for himself, invisible to uninitiated mankind, to watch over and protect it.\n\n\n\n"}
