This is related to Cesare Burali-Forti's \"paradox\" which states that there can be no greatest ordinal number. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.\n\nMore generally, as noted by A. W. Moore, there can be no end to the process of set formation, and thus no such thing as the \"totality of all sets\", or the \"set hierarchy\". Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the hierarchy and thus failing to contain every set.\n\nA standard solution to this problem is found in Zermelo's set theory, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property \"and lie in some given set\" (Zermelo's Axiom of Separation). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.\n\nWhile this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, naive set theory might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a class to describe arbitrary (possibly \"large\") entities, these predicates of the meta-language may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a proper class. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in set theory and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as New Foundations by Willard Van Orman Quine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2726571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2726571", "title": "Archetypal psychology", "text": "Archetypal psychology\n\nArchetypal psychology was initiated as a distinct movement in the early 1970s by James Hillman, a psychologist who trained in analytical psychology and became the first Director of the Jung Institute in Zurich. Hillman reports that archetypal psychology emerged partly from the Jungian tradition whilst drawing also from other traditions and authorities such as Henry Corbin, Vico and Plotinus.\n\nArchetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the notion of ego and focuses on what it calls the \"psyche\", or \"soul\", and the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, \"the fundamental fantasies that animate all life\" (Moore, in Hillman, 1991). Archetypal psychology likens itself to a polytheistic mythology in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and myths – gods, goddesses, demigods, mortals and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. In this framework the ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies. Archetypal psychology is, along with the classical and developmental schools, one of the three schools of post-Jungian psychology outlined by Andrew Samuels (see Samuels, 1995).\n\nThe main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is Carl Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical Greek, Renaissance, and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.\n\nCarl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychologist who was the first father of archetypal psychology. Jungian archetypes are thought patterns that find worldwide parallels in individuals or entire cultures. Archai appear in dreams, religions, the arts, and social customs in all people and they manifest impulsively in mental disorders. According to Jung archetypal ideas and patterns reside within the collective unconscious, which is a blueprint inherent in every individual, as opposed to the personal unconscious, which contains a single individual's repressed ideas, desires and memories as described by Freud. What differentiates Jungian psychology from archetypal psychology is that Jung believed archetypes are cultural, anthropological, and transcend the empirical world of time and place, and are not phenomenal. On the contrary, Archetypal psychology views archetypes to always be phenomenal.\n\nHenry Corbin, a French scholar and philosopher, is the second father of archetypal psychology. Corbin created the idea of the existence of the \"mundus imaginalis\" which is a distinct field of imaginable realities and offers an ontological mode of location of archetypes of the psyche. The mundus imaginalis provided an evaluative and cosmic grounding for archetypes. The second contribution Corbin made to the field was the idea that archetypes are accessible to imagination and first present themselves as images, so the procedure of archetypal psychology must be rhetorical and poetic, without logical reasoning, and the goal in therapy should be to restore the patient's imaginable realities. Therefore, the goal of therapy is the middle ground of psychic realities, a development of a sense of soul. Also, according to Corbin, the method of therapy is the cultivation of imagination.\n\nEdward S. Casey is attributed with distinguishing archetypal psychology from other theories by explaining an image as a way of seeing rather than something seen. According to Casey an image is only perceived by imagining because an image is not what one sees but the way one sees. He also states that imagination is an activity of soul and not just a human faculty. An image appears to be more profound, more powerful, and more beautiful than the comprehension of it. This explains the drive behind the arts which provide disciplines that can actualize the complexity of the image.\n\nHillman (1975) sketches a brief lineage of archetypal psychology.\n\nThomas Moore says of James Hillman's teaching that he \"portrays the psyche as inherently multiple\". In Hillman's archetypal/polytheistic view, the psyche or soul has many directions and sources of meaning – and this can feel like an ongoing state of conflict – a struggle with one's daimones. According to Hillman, \"polytheistic psychology can give sacred differentiation to our psychic turmoil.…\" Hillman states that\nHillman qualifies his many references to gods as differing from a literalistic approach saying that for him they are \"aides memoires\", i.e. sounding boards employed \"for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of life.\" Hillman further insists that he does not view the pantheon of gods as a 'master matrix' against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness.\n\nHillman says he has been critical of the 20th century's psychologies (e.g. biological psychology, behaviorism, cognitive psychology) that have adopted a natural scientific philosophy and praxis. His main criticisms include that they are reductive, materialistic, and literal; they are psychologies without psyche, without soul. Accordingly, Hillman's oeuvre has been an attempt to restore psyche to its proper place in psychology. Hillman sees the soul at work in imagination, fantasy, myth and metaphor. He also sees soul revealed in psychopathology, in the symptoms of psychological disorders. Psyche-pathos-logos is the \"speech of the suffering soul\" or the soul's suffering of meaning. A great portion of Hillman's thought attempts to attend to the speech of the soul as it is revealed via images and fantasies.\n\nHillman has his own definition of soul. Primarily, he notes that soul is not a \"thing\", not an entity. Nor is it something that is located \"inside\" a person. Rather, soul is \"a perspective rather than a substance, a viewpoint towards things… (it is) reflective; it mediates events and makes differences…\"(1975). Soul is not to be located in the brain or in the head, for example (where most modern psychologies place it), but human beings are in psyche. The world, in turn, is the anima mundi, or the world ensouled. Hillman often quotes a phrase coined by the Romantic poet John Keats: \"call the world the vale of soul-making.\"\n\nAdditionally, Hillman (1975) says he observes that soul:\n\nThe notion of soul as imaginative possibility, in relation to the archai or root metaphors, is what Hillman has termed the \"poetic basis of mind\".\n\nBecause Hillman's archetypal psychology is concerned with fantasy, myth, and image, it is not surprising that dreams are considered to be significant in relation to soul and soul-making. Hillman does not believe that dreams are simply random residue or flotsam from waking life (as advanced by physiologists), but neither does he believe that dreams are compensatory for the struggles of waking life, or are invested with \"secret\" meanings of how one should live (à la Jung). Rather, \"dreams tell us where we are, not what to do\" (1979). Therefore, Hillman is against the 20th century traditional interpretive methods of dream analysis. Hillman's approach is phenomenological rather than analytic (which breaks the dream down into its constituent parts) and interpretive/hermeneutic (which may make a dream image \"something other\" than what it appears to be in the dream). His dictum with regard to dream content and process is \"Stick with the image.\"\n\nHillman (1983) describes his position succinctly:\n\nThe snake in the dream does not become something else: it is none of the things Hillman mentioned, and neither is it a penis, as Hillman says Freud might have maintained, nor the serpent from the Garden of Eden, as Hillman thinks Jung might have mentioned. It is not something someone can look up in a dream dictionary; its meaning has not been given in advance. Rather, the black snake is the black snake. Approaching the dream snake phenomenologically simply means describing the snake and attending to how the snake appears as a snake in the dream. It is a huge black snake, that is given. But are there other snakes in the dream? If so, is it bigger than the other snakes? Smaller? Is it a black snake among green snakes? Or is it alone? What is the setting, a desert or a rain forest? Is the snake getting ready to feed? Shedding its skin? Sunning itself on a rock? All of these questions are elicited from the primary image of the snake in the dream, and as such can be rich material revealing the psychological life of the dreamer and the life of the psyche spoken through the dream.\n\nHillman's book, \"The Soul's Code: In Search of Character and Calling\", outlines an \"acorn theory of the soul.\" His theory states that each individual holds the potential for their unique possibilities inside themselves already, much as an acorn holds the pattern for an oak, invisible within itself. It argues against the parental fallacy whereby our parents are seen as crucial in determining who we are by supplying us with genetic material and behavioral patterns. Instead the book suggests for a reconnection with what is invisible within us, our daimon or soul or acorn and the acorn's calling to the wider world of nature. It argues against theories which attempt to map life into phases, suggesting that this is counter-productive and makes people feel like they are failing to live up to what is normal. This in turn produces a truncated, normalized society of soulless mediocrity where evil is not allowed but injustice is everywhere – a society that cannot tolerate eccentricity or the further reaches of life experiences but sees them as illnesses to be medicated out of existence.\n\nHillman diverges from Jung and his idea of the Self. Hillman sees Jung as too prescriptive and argues against the idea of life-maps by which to try to grow properly.\n\nInstead, Hillman suggests a reappraisal of each individual's childhood and present life to try to find the individual's particular calling, the acorn of the soul. He has written that he is the one to help precipitate a re-souling of the world in the space between rationality and psychology. He replaces the notion of growing up, with the myth of growing down from the womb into a messy, confusing earthy world. Hillman rejects formal logic in favour of reference to case histories of well known people and considers his arguments to be in line with the \"puer aeternus\" or eternal youth whose brief burning existence could be seen in the work of romantic poets like Keats and Byron and in recently deceased young rock stars like Jeff Buckley or Kurt Cobain. Hillman also rejects causality as a defining framework and suggests in its place a shifting form of fate whereby events are not inevitable but bound to be expressed in some way dependent on the character of the soul or acorn in question.\n\nPsychopathology is viewed as the psyche's independent ability to create morbidity, disorder, illness, abnormality and suffering in any part of its behavior and to imagine and experience life through a deformed perspective.\n\nArchetypal psychology follows the following procedures for therapy:\nThese procedures may be modified depending on the therapist and the client. In therapy both the therapist and client explore the client's habitual behavior, feelings, fantasies, dreams, memories, and ideas. The goal of therapy is the improvement of the client and termination of treatment. Goals are not stated for therapy.\n\nSee James Hillman: Criticism\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions. The message that government and the courts must err on the side of innocence has remained constant.\n\nThe phrase, repeated widely and usually in isolation, comes from a longer passage, the fourth in a series of five discussions of policy by Blackstone:\n\nThe phrase was absorbed by the British legal system, becoming a maxim by the early 19th century. It was also absorbed into American common law, cited repeatedly by that country's Founding Fathers, later becoming a standard drilled into law students all the way into the 21st century.\nOther commentators have echoed the principle; Benjamin Franklin stated it as, \"it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer\".\n\nDefending British soldiers charged with murder for their role in the Boston Massacre, John Adams also expanded upon the rationale behind Blackstone's Ratio when he stated: \n\nGiven that Hale and Fortescue in English law had made similar statements previously, some kind of explanation is required for the enormous popularity and influence of the phrase across all the Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Cullerne Bown has argued that it \"...can be seen as a new kind of buttress of the law that was required in a new kind of society.\" \n\nThe immediate precursors of Blackstone's Ratio in English law were articulations by Sir Matthew Hale (about 100 years earlier) and Sir John Fortescue (about 200 years before that), both influential jurists in their time.\n\nHale wrote, \"for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.\" Fortescue's \"De Laudibus Legum Angliae\" (c. 1470) states that \"one would much rather that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned and suffer capitally.\" \n\nSome 300 years before Fortescue, the Jewish legal theorist Maimonides wrote that \"the Exalted One has shut this door\" against the use of presumptive evidence, for \"it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\"\n\nMaimonides argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would progressively lead to convictions merely \"according to the judge's caprice\" and was expounding on both Exodus 23:7 (\"the innocent and righteous slay thou not\") and an Islamic text, [Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi.\n\n[Jami'] of at-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as saying, \"Avoid legal punishments as far as possible, and if there are any doubts in the case then use them, for it is better for a judge to err towards leniency than towards punishment\". Another similar expression reads, \"Invoke doubtfulness in evidence during prosecution to avoid legal punishments\". \n\nOther statements, some even older, which seem to express similar sentiments have been compiled by Volokh. A vaguely similar principle, echoing the number ten and the idea that it would be preferable that many guilty people escape consequences than a few innocents suffer them, appears as early as the narrative of the Cities of the Plain in Genesis (at 18:23-32),\n\nWith respect to the destruction of Sodom, the text describes it as ultimately being destroyed, but only after the rescuing of most of Lot's family, the aforementioned \"righteous\" among a city or overwhelming wickedness who, despite the overwhelming guilt of their fellows, were sufficient by their mere presence to warrant a \"stay of execution\" of sorts for the entire region, slated to be destroyed for being uniformly a place of sin. The text continues, \n\nSimilarly, on 3 October 1692, while decrying the Salem witch trials, Increase Mather adapted Fortescue's statement and wrote, \"It were better that Ten Suspected Witches should escape, than that one Innocent Person should be Condemned.\"\n\nParticularly in the United States, Blackstone’s ratio continues to be an active source of debate in jurisprudence. For example Daniel Epps and Laura Appleman exchanged arguments against and in favour of its continuing influence in the Harvard Law Review in 2015. \n\nAuthoritarian personalities tend to take the opposite view; Bismarck is believed to have stated that \"it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape\". Pol Pot made similar remarks. Wolfgang Schäuble referenced this principle while saying that it is not applicable to the context of preventing terrorist attacks. Former American Vice President Dick Cheney said that his support of American use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" against suspected terrorists was unchanged by the fact that 25% of CIA detainees subject to that treatment were later proven to be innocent, including one who died of hypothermia in CIA custody. \"I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that in fact were innocent.\" Asked whether the 25% margin was too high, Cheney responded, \"I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective. ... I'd do it again in a minute.\"\n\nLiberal columnist Ezra Klein supported California's SB 967 \"Affirmative Consent\" law with the same reasoning as Cheney's supported \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". While claiming the law was \"terrible\" and could be used to punish people who did not commit rape, Klein states \"its overreach is precisely its value\" and \"ugly problems don't always have pretty solutions\".\n\nAlexander Volokh cites an apparent questioning of the principle, with the tale of a Chinese professor who responds, \"Better for whom?\"\n"}

{"id": "7082881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7082881", "title": "Enactivism", "text": "Enactivism\n\nEnactivism argues that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment. It claims that our environment is one which we selectively create through our capacities to interact with the world. \"Organisms do not passively receive information from their environments, which they then translate into internal representations. Natural cognitive systems...participate in the generation of meaning ...engaging in transformational and not merely informational interactions: \"they enact a world\".\" These authors suggest that the increasing emphasis upon enactive terminology presages a new era in thinking about cognitive science. How the actions involved in enactivism relate to age-old questions about free will remains a topic of active debate.\n\nThe term 'enactivism' is close in meaning to 'enaction', defined as \"the manner in which a subject of perception creatively matches its actions to the requirements of its situation\". The introduction of the term \"enaction\" in this context is attributed to Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, who proposed the name to \"emphasize the growing conviction that cognition is not the representation of a pre-given world by a pre-given mind but is rather the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of the variety of actions that a being in the world performs\". This was further developed by Thompson and others, to place emphasis upon the idea that experience of the world is a result of mutual interaction between the sensorimotor capacities of the organism and its environment.\n\nThe initial emphasis of enactivism upon sensorimotor skills has been criticized as \"cognitively marginal\", but it has been extended to apply to higher level cognitive activities, such as social interactions. \"In the enactive view... knowledge is constructed: it is constructed by an agent through its sensorimotor interactions with its environment, co-constructed between and within living species through their meaningful interaction with each other. In its most abstract form, knowledge is co-constructed between human individuals in socio-linguistic interactions...Science is a particular form of social knowledge construction...[that] allows us to perceive and predict events beyond our immediate cognitive grasp...and also to construct further, even more powerful scientific knowledge.\"\n\nEnactivism is closely related to situated cognition and embodied cognition, and is presented as an alternative to cognitivism, computationalism, and Cartesian dualism.\n\nEnactivism is one of a cluster of related theories sometimes known as the \"4Es\". As described by Mark Rowlands, mental processes are:\n\nEnactivism proposes an alternative to dualism as a philosophy of mind, in that it emphasises the interactions between mind, body and the environment, seeing them all as inseparably intertwined in mental processes. The self arises as part of the process of an embodied entity interacting with the environment in precise ways determined by its physiology. In this sense, individuals can be seen to \"grow into\" or arise from their interactive role with the world.\n\nIn \"The Tree of Knowledge\" Maturana & Varela proposed the term \"enactive\" \"to evoke the view of knowledge that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism or connectionism. They see enactivism as providing a middle ground between the two extremes of representationalism and solipsism. They seek to \"confront the problem of understanding how our existence-the praxis of our living- is coupled to a surrounding world which appears filled with regularities that are at every instant the result of our biological and social histories... to find a \"via media\": to understand the regularity of the world we are experiencing at every moment, but without any point of reference independent of ourselves that would give certainty to our descriptions and cognitive assertions. Indeed the whole mechanism of generating ourselves, as describers and observers tells us that our world, as the world which we bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have precisely that mixture of regularity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of human experience when we look at it up close.\"[\"Tree of Knowledge\", p. 241]\n\nEnactivism also addresses the hard problem of consciousness, referred to by Thompson as part of the \"explanatory gap\" in explaining how consciousness and subjective experience are related to brain and body. \"The problem with the dualistic concepts of consciousness and life in standard formulations of the hard problem is that they exclude each other by construction\". Instead, according to Thompson's view of enactivism, the study of consciousness or phenomenology as exemplified by Husserl and Merleau-Ponty is to complement science and its objectification of the world. \"The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world of which science is the second-order expression\" (Merleau-Ponty, \"The phenomenology of perception\" as quoted by Thompson, p. 165). In this interpretation, enactivism asserts that science is formed or enacted as part of humankind's interactivity with its world, and by embracing phenomenology \"science itself is properly situated in relation to the rest of human life and is thereby secured on a sounder footing.\"\n\nEnaction has been seen as a move to conjoin representationalism with phenomenalism, that is, as adopting a constructivist epistemology, an epistemology centered upon the active participation of the subject in constructing reality. However, 'constructivism' focuses upon more than a simple 'interactivity' that could be described as a minor adjustment to 'assimilate' reality or 'accommodate' to it. Constructivism looks upon interactivity as a radical, creative, revisionist process in which the knower \"constructs\" a personal 'knowledge system' based upon their experience and tested by its viability in practical encounters with their environment. Learning is a result of perceived anomalies that produce dissatisfaction with existing conceptions.\n\nHow does constructivism relate to enactivism? From the above remarks it can be seen that Glasersfeld expresses an interactivity between the knower and the known quite acceptable to an enactivist, but does not emphasize the structured probing of the environment by the knower that leads to the \"perturbation relative to some expected result\" that then leads to a new understanding. It is this probing activity, especially where it is not accidental but deliberate, that characterizes enaction, and invokes \"affect\", that is, the motivation and planning that lead to doing and to fashioning the probing, both observing and modifying the environment, so that \"perceptions and nature condition one another through generating one another.\" The questioning nature of this probing activity is not an emphasis of Piaget and Glasersfeld.\n\nSharing enactivism's stress upon both action and embodiment in the incorporation of knowledge, but giving Glasersfeld's mechanism of viability an evolutionary emphasis, is evolutionary epistemology. Inasmuch as an organism must reflect its environment well enough for the organism to be able to survive in it, and to be competitive enough to be able to reproduce at sustainable rate, the structure and reflexes of the organism itself embody knowledge of its environment. This biology-inspired theory of the growth of knowledge is closely tied to universal Darwinism, and is associated with evolutionary epistemologists such as Karl Popper, Donald T. Campbell, Peter Munz, and Gary Cziko. According to Munz, \"an organism is an \"embodied theory\" about its environment... Embodied theories are also no longer expressed in language, but in anatomical structures or reflex responses, etc.\"\n\nMcGann & others argue that enactivism attempts to mediate between the explanatory role of the coupling between cognitive agent and environment and the traditional emphasis on brain mechanisms found in neuroscience and psychology. In the interactive approach to social cognition developed by De Jaegher & others, the dynamics of interactive processes are seen to play significant roles in coordinating interpersonal understanding, processes that in part include what they call \"participatory sense-making\". Recent developments of enactivism in the area of social neuroscience involve the proposal of \"The Interactive Brain Hypothesis\" where social cognition brain mechanisms, even those used in non-interactive situations, are proposed to have interactive origins.\n\nIn the enactive view, perception \"is not conceived as the transmission of information but more as an exploration of the world by various means. Cognition is not tied into the workings of an 'inner mind', some cognitive core, but occurs in directed interaction between the body and the world it inhabits.\"\n\nAlva Noë in advocating an enactive view of perception sought to resolve how we perceive three-dimensional objects, on the basis of two-dimensional input. He argues that we perceive this solidity (or 'volumetricity') by appealing to patterns of sensorimotor expectations. These arise from our agent-active 'movements and interaction' with objects, or 'object-active' changes in the object itself. The solidity is perceived through our expectations and skills in knowing how the object's appearance would change with changes in how we relate to it. He saw all perception as an active exploration of the world, rather than being a passive process, something which happens to us.\n\nNoë's idea of the role of 'expectations' in three-dimensional perception has been opposed by several philosophers, notably by Andy Clark. Clark points to difficulties of the enactive approach. He points to internal processing of visual signals, for example, in the ventral and dorsal pathways, the two-streams hypothesis. This results in an integrated perception of objects (their recognition and location, respectively) yet this processing cannot be described as an action or actions. In a more general criticism, Clark suggests that perception is not a matter of expectations about sensorimotor mechanisms guiding perception. Rather, although the limitations of sensorimotor mechanisms constrain perception, this sensorimotor activity is drastically filtered to fit current needs and purposes of the organism, and it is these imposed 'expectations' that govern perception, filtering for the 'relevant' details of sensorimotor input (called \"sensorimotor summarizing\").\n\nThese sensorimotor-centered and purpose-centered views appear to agree on the general scheme but disagree on the dominance issue – is the dominant component peripheral or central. Another view, the closed-loop perception one, assigns equal a-priori dominance to the peripheral and central components. In closed-loop perception, perception emerges through the process of inclusion of an item in a motor-sensory-motor loop, i.e., a loop (or loops) connecting the peripheral and central components that are relevant to that item. The item can be a body part (in which case the loops are in steady-state) or an external object (in which case the loops are perturbed and gradually converge to a steady state). These enactive loops are always active, switching dominance by the need.\n\nAnother application of enaction to perception is analysis of the human hand. The many remarkably demanding uses of the hand are not learned by instruction, but through a history of engagements that lead to the acquisition of skills. According to one interpretation, it is suggested that \"the hand [is]...an organ of cognition\", not a faithful subordinate working under top-down instruction, but a partner in a \"bi-directional interplay between manual and brain activity.\" According to Daniel Hutto: \"Enactivists are concerned to defend the view that our most elementary ways of engaging with the world and others - including our basic forms of perception and perceptual experience - are mindful in the sense of being phenomenally charged and intentionally directed, despite being non-representational and content-free.\" Hutto calls this position 'REC' (Radical Enactive Cognition): \"According to REC, there is no way to distinguish neural activity that is imagined to be genuinely content involving (and thus truly mental, truly cognitive) from other non-neural activity that merely plays a supporting or enabling role in making mind and cognition possible.\"\n\nHanne De Jaegher and Ezequiel Di Paolo (2007) have extended the enactive concept of sense-making into the social domain. The idea takes as its departure point the process of interaction between individuals in a social encounter. De Jaegher and Di Paolo argue that the interaction process itself can take on a form of autonomy (operationally defined). This allows them to define social cognition as the generation of meaning and its transformation through interacting individuals.\n\nThe notion of participatory sense-making has led to the proposal that interaction processes can sometimes play constitutive roles in social cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, Gallagher, 2010). It has been applied to research in social neuroscience\"\" and autism.\"\"\n\nIn a similar vein, \"an inter-enactive approach to agency holds that the behavior of agents in a social situation unfolds not only according to their individual abilities and goals, but also according to the conditions and constraints imposed by the autonomous dynamics of the interaction process itself\". According to Torrance, enactivism involves five interlocking themes related to the question \"What is it to be a (cognizing, conscious) agent?\" It is:\n\nTorrance adds that \"many kinds of agency, in particular the agency of human beings, cannot be understood separately from understanding the nature of the interaction that occurs between agents.\" That view introduces the social applications of enactivism. \"Social cognition is regarded as the result of a special form of action, namely \"social interaction\"...the enactive approach looks at the circular dynamic within a dyad of embodied agents.\"\nIn cultural psychology, enactivism is seen as a way to uncover cultural influences upon feeling, thinking and acting. Baerveldt and Verheggen argue that \"It appears that seemingly natural experience is thoroughly intertwined with sociocultural realities.\" They suggest that the social patterning of experience is to be understood through enactivism, \"the idea that the reality we have in common, and in which we find ourselves, is neither a world that exists independently from us, nor a socially shared way of representing such a pregiven world, but a world itself brought forth by our ways of communicating and our joint action...The world we inhabit is manufactured of 'meaning' rather than 'information'.\n\nLuhmann attempted to apply Maturana and Varela's notion of autopoiesis to social systems. \"A core concept of social systems theory is derived from biological systems theory: the concept of \"autopoiesis\". Chilean biologist Humberto Maturana come up with the concept to explain how biological systems such as cells are a product of their own production.\" \"Systems exist by way of operational closure and this means that they each construct themselves and their own realities.\"\n\nThe first definition of enaction was introduced by psychologist Jerome Bruner, who introduced enaction as 'learning by doing' in his discussion of how children learn, and how they can best be helped to learn. He associated enaction with two other ways of knowledge organization: Iconic and Symbolic.\n\nThe term 'enactive framework' was elaborated upon by Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana.\n\nSriramen argues that enactivism provides \"a rich and powerful explanatory theory for learning and being.\" and that it is closely related to both the ideas of cognitive development of Piaget, and also the social constructivism of Vygotsky. Piaget focused on the child's immediate environment, and suggested cognitive structures like spatial perception emerge as a result of the child's interaction with the world. According to Piaget, children \"construct\" knowledge, using what they know in new ways and testing it, and the environment provides feedback concerning the adequacy of their construction. In a cultural context, Vygotsky suggested that the kind of cognition that can take place is not dictated by the engagement of the isolated child, but is also a function of social interaction and dialogue that is contingent upon a sociohistorical context. Enactivism in educational theory \"looks at each learning situation as a complex system consisting of teacher, learner, and context, all of which frame and co-create the learning situation.\" Enactivism in education is very closely related to situated cognition, which holds that \"knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used.\" This approach challenges the \"separating of what is learned from how it is learned and used.\"\n\nThe ideas of enactivism regarding how organisms engage with their environment have interested those involved in robotics and man-machine interfaces. The analogy is drawn that a robot can be designed to interact and learn from its environment in a manner similar to the way an organism does that, and a human can interact with a computer-aided design tool or data base using an interface that creates an enactive environment for the user, that is, all the user's tactile, auditory, and visual capabilities are enlisted in a mutually explorative engagement, capitalizing upon all the user's abilities, and not at all limited to cerebral engagement. In these areas it is common to refer to affordances as a design concept, the idea that an environment or an interface affords opportunities for enaction, and good design involves optimizing the role of such affordances.\n\nThe activity in the AI community also has influenced enactivism as whole. Referring extensively to modeling techniques for evolutionary robotics by Beer, the modeling of learning behavior by Kelso, and to modeling of sensorimotor activity by Saltzman, McGann, De Jaegher, and Di Paolo discuss how this work makes the dynamics of coupling between an agent and its environment, the foundation of enactivism, \"an operational, empirically observable phenomenon.\" That is, the AI environment invents examples of enactivism using concrete examples that, although not as complex as living organisms, isolate and illuminate basic principles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38755621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38755621", "title": "Feminine beauty ideal", "text": "Feminine beauty ideal\n\nThe feminine beauty ideal is \"the socially constructed notion that physical attractiveness is one of women's most important assets, and something all women should strive to achieve and maintain\". Feminine beauty ideals are rooted in heteronormative beliefs, and heavily influence women of all sexual orientations. The feminine beauty ideal, which also includes female body shape, varies from culture to culture. Pressure to conform to a certain definition of \"beautiful\" can have drastic psychological effects. These ideals have been correlated with depression, eating disorders, and low self-esteem, starting from an adolescent age and continuing into adulthood.\n\nThe feminine beauty ideal is portrayed in many children's fairy tales. It has been common in the Brothers Grimm fairy tales for physical attractiveness in female characters to be rewarded. In those fairy tales, \"beauty is often associated with being white, economically privileged, and virtuous.\"\n\nThe Brothers Grimm fairy tales usually involve a beautiful heroine. In the story \"Snow White\", the protagonist Snow White is described as being \"white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood\" and \"as beautiful as the light of day.\" This fairy tale is defining beauty as being Caucasian with rosy cheeks and black hair. On the other hand, the antagonist of Brothers Grimm fairy tales is frequently described as ugly, relating beauty with goodness and ugliness with evil. Ultimately, this correlation puts an emphasis on the virtue of being beautiful, as defined by fairy tales.\n\nStarting almost 100 years after the Grimm Brothers wrote their fairy tales, the Walt Disney Animation Studios adapted these tales into animated feature films. About 40 percent of Disney films made from 1937-2000 had \"only dominant cultural themes portrayed.\" Because the majority of characters are white, \"the expectation [is] that all people are or should be like this.\" Other common traits of female Disney characters are thin bodies with impossible bodily proportions, long, flowing hair, and large round eyes. The constant emphasis on female beauty and what constitutes as being beautiful contributes to the overall feminine beauty ideal.\n\nMass media is one of the most powerful tools for young girls and women to learn and also understand feminine beauty ideals. As mass media develops, the way people see feminine beauty ideals changes, as does how females view themselves. \"The average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day,\" says Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University. In most advertisements, female models are typically homogeneous in appearance. \"Girls today are swamped by [ultra-thin] ideals not only in the form of dolls but also in comics, cartoons, TV, and advertising along with all the associated merchandising.\" In addition to this, the feminine beauty ideal in the mass media is manipulated by technology. Images of women can be virtually manipulated creating an ideal that is not only rare but also nonexistent. The \"Encyclopedia of Gender in the Media\" states that \"the postproduction techniques of airbrushing and computer-generated modifications 'perfect' the beauty myth by removing any remaining blemishes or imperfections visible to the eye.\" Advertisements for products \"such as diets, cosmetics, and exercise gear [help] the media construct a dream world of hopes and high standards that incorporates the glorification of slenderness and weight loss.\"\n\nWith a focus on an ideal physical appearance, the feminine beauty ideal distracts from female competency by prioritizing and valuing superficial characteristics related to beauty and appearance. When physical beauty is idealized and featured in the media, it reduces women to sexualized objects. This creates the message across mass media that one's body is inadequate apart from sex appeal and connects concepts of beauty and sex.\n\nPerfection is achieved by celebrities through photoshopped images that hide every blemish or flaw while also editing body parts to create the \"ideal\" hourglass body type. \"The Dove Beauty and Confidence Report\" interviewed 10,500 females across thirteen countries and found that women's confidence in their body image is steadily declining - regardless of age or geographic location. Despite these findings, there is a strong desire to fight existing beauty ideals. In fact, 71% of women and 67% of girls want the media to do a better job of portraying different types of women. Studies done by Dove reveal low self esteem impacts women and girls' ability to release their true potential. 85% of women and 79% of girls admit they opt out of important life activities when they do not feel confident in the way they look. More than half of women (69%) and girls (65%) allude to pressure from the media and advertisements to become the world's version of beautiful, which is a driving force of appearance anxiety. Studies done by Dove have also revealed the following statistics: \"4% of women consider themselves beautiful, 11% of girls globally are comfortable with describing themselves as beautiful, 72% of girls feel pressure to be beautiful, 80% of women agree that every woman has something about her that is beautiful, but do not see their own beauty, and that 54% of women agree that when it comes to how they look, they are their own worst beauty critic.\"\n\nAn online space such as Instagram that is based on interactions through pictures creates a focus on one’s physical appearance. According to evidence gathered from a study focusing on general Instagram use in young women, researchers suggest Instagram usage was positively correlated with women’s self-objectification. This same study also considered the effect of Instagram on the internalization of the Western beauty ideal for women, and the evidence gathered in the study agrees with the idea that Instagram use encourages women to internalize the societal beauty ideal of Western culture. Because users have the opportunity to shape and edit their photographs before sharing them, they can force them to adhere to the beauty ideal. Viewing these carefully selected pictures shows the extent to which women internalize the Western beauty ideal. In addition to researching the effects of general Instagram use, the study also researched the effects of \"fitspiration\" Instagram pages on young women's body image. “Fitspiration” pages aim to motivate the viewer through images of healthy eating and exercising. Although these pages aim to be a positive way to promote a healthy lifestyle, they are also appearance-based and contain images of toned and skinny women. According to the study, there is a positive correlation to young women’s viewing \"fitspiration\" pages and a negative body image.\n\nA case study conducted about Instagram use and the Western feminine beauty ideal focused on the specific account @effyourbeautystandards, a body-positive Instagram page created by feminist plus-size model Tessa Holliday. Through her page, Holliday instructed women to share pictures of themselves on Instagram with the hashtag #effyourbeautystandards. Images posted with this hashtag would be selected by the account administrators and posted to the @effyourbeauutystandards page. The evidence gathered in this case study suggested that while these selected pictures attempt to take an intersectional approach to the content women view on social media, they may still have an effect on how women view their bodies.\n\nFeminine beauty ideals have shown correlations to many psychological disorders, including lowered self-esteem and eating disorders. Western cultural standards of beauty and attractiveness promote unhealthy and unattainable body ideals that motivate women to seek perfection. Since 1972, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of women in the United States who experience dissatisfaction with their bodies. Research indicates that women's exposure to television, even for a very short time, can experience decreased mood and self-esteem. It has been consistently found that perceived appearance is the single strongest predictor of global self-esteem among young adults. Awareness of the ideal female shape is linked to increasingly negative self-esteem. Through peer interaction and an environment of continual comparison to those portrayed in the media, women are often made to feel inadequate, and thus their self-esteem can decrease from their negative self-image. A negative body image can result in adverse psychosocial consequences, including depression, poor self-esteem, and diminished quality of life.\n\nThere is significant pressure for girls to conform to feminine beauty ideals, and, since thinness is prized as feminine, many women feel dissatisfied with their body shape. Body dissatisfaction has been found to be a precursor to serious psychological problems such as depression, social anxiety, and eating disorders. The feminine beauty ideal has influenced women, particularly younger women, to partake in extreme measures. Some of these extreme measures include limiting their food intake, and participating in excessive physical activity to try to achieve what is considered the \"ideal beauty standards\". One aspect of the feminine beauty ideal includes having a thin waist, which is causing women to participate in these alarming behaviors. When trying to achieve these impossible standards, these dangerous practices are put into place. These practices can eventually lead to the woman developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. As achieving the \"beauty ideal\" becomes a more popular phenomenon, these eating disorders are becoming more prevalent, especially in young women. Researchers have found that magazine advertisements promoting dieting and thinness are far more prevalent in women's magazine than in men's magazine, and that female television characters are far more likely to be thin than male characters. Eating disorders stem from individual body dysmorphia, or an excessive preoccupation with perceived flaws in appearance. Researchers suggest that this behavior strongly correlates with societal pressure for women to live up to the standards of beauty set by a culture obsessed with being thin. Research has shown that people have subconsciously associated heavier body sizes with negative personality characteristics such as laziness and lack of self-control. Fat-body prejudice appears as young as early childhood and continues into adult years. The problem of negative body-image worsens as females go through puberty; girls in adolescence frequently report being dissatisfied with their weight and fear future weight gain. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD), the age of the onset of eating disorders is getting younger. Girls as young as elementary-school age report body dissatisfaction and dieting in order to look like magazine models.\n\nThere have been many ideas over time and across different cultures of what the feminine beauty \"ideal\" is for a woman's body image. How well a woman follows these beauty ideals can also influence her social status within her culture. Physically altering the body has been a custom in many areas of the world for a long time. For example, decorating the body with tattoos is a symbol of attractiveness and status in the Japanese culture. The art of irezumi, or covering a woman's back with tattoos, is still practiced today in Japan. In Burma, Padung girls from the age of about five years, have metal rings put around their necks. Additional rings are added to the girl's neck every two years. This practice is done to produce a giraffe like effect in women. This practice is dying out, but these women would eventually carry up to 24 rings around their necks. A neck with many rings was considered the \"ideal\" image of physical beauty in this culture. In Europe, the corset has been used over time to create a tiny waistline. In Europe, a tiny waistline was considered \"ideal\" for beauty. A practice in China involved a girl's feet being bound at age six to create the \"ideal\" image of feet. The girl's feet were bound to become 1/3 the original size, which crippled the woman, but also gave her a very high social status and was much admired. After the revolution of 1911, this practice of foot binding was ended. The idea of what is considered the \"ideal\" of beauty for women varies across different cultural ideals and practices.\n\nThere have been multiple \"ideals for women\" in France as well as other various cultures. A more common ideal is for females to have the \"three white things\". These \"things\" or traits refer to skin, teeth, and hands. There are also the \"three black things\" including the color of the person's eyebrows and eyelashes. This leaves three other areas to embark on color including the cheeks, lips, and nails.\n\nIdeas of feminine beauty may have originated from features that correlate with fertility and health. These features include a figure where there is more fat distribution in the hip and thigh area, and vary between different cultures. Within Western cultures, having a smaller waist and bigger hips has a large influence. This differs in Eastern cultures.\n"}
{"id": "11393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11393", "title": "Four Noble Truths", "text": "Four Noble Truths\n\nThe Four Noble Truths refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism in a short expression: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which are \"dukkha\", \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. This craving keeps us caught in \"samsara\", the endless cycle of repeated \"bhava\" (\"becoming\") and \"jāti\" (literally: \"birth\", interpreted as rebirth), and the continued \"dukkha\" that comes with it. There is, however, a way to end this cycle, namely by attaining \"nirvana\", cessation of craving, whereafter birth and the accompanying \"dukkha\" will no longer arise again. This can be accomplished by following the eightfold path, restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing mindfulness and \"dhyana\".\n\nIn short form, the four truths are \"dukkha\", \"samudaya\" (\"arising,\" \"coming together\"), \"nirodha\" (\"cessation,\" \"confinement\"), and \"marga\", the path leading to cessation. As the \"Four Noble Truths\" (Sanskrit: \"catvāri āryasatyāni\"; Pali: \"cattāri ariyasaccāni\"), they are \"the truths of the Noble Ones,\" the truths or realities which are understood by the \"worthy ones\" who have attained nirvana.\n\nIn the \"sutras\", Buddhist religious texts, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function. They represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, but also the possibility of liberation for all sentient beings, describing how release from craving is to be reached. In the Pali canon scriptures, the four truths appear in a \"network of teachings,\" as part of \"the entire \"dhamma\" matrix,\" which have to be taken together. They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or \"experienced\". \n\nThe function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time, when \"prajna\", or \"liberating insight,\" came to be regarded as liberating in itself, instead of or in addition to the practice of \"dhyana\", meditation. This \"liberating insight\" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as part of the enlightenment story of the Buddha.\n\nThe four truths became of central importance in the Theravada tradition of Buddhism, which holds to the idea that insight into the four truths is liberating in itself. They are less prominent in the Mahayana tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into \"sunyata\", emptiness, and following the Bodhisattva path as central elements in their teachings and practice. The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be \"pervasively operative in this world.\" Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by western colonialists in the 19th century and the development of Buddhist modernism, they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism.\n\nThe four truths are best known from their presentation in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" text, which contains two sets of the four truths, while various other sets can be found in the Pali Canon, a collection of scriptures in the Theravadan Buddhist tradition. According to the Buddhist tradition, the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\", \"Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion,\" contains the first teachings that the Buddha gave after attaining full awakening, and liberation from rebirth. According to L. S. Cousins, many scholars are of the view that \"this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,\" and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions. Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows (\"bhikkus\" is normally translated as \"Buddhist monks\"):\nAccording to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from \"samsara\", the cycle of rebirth, was attained:\nThe comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the \"Dhamma Eye\", that is, the attainment of right vision:\nAccording to K. R. Norman, the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the \"mnemonic set,\" which were \"intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs.\" The earliest form of the mnemonic set was \"dukkham samudayo nirodho magga,\" without the reference to the Pali terms \"sacca\" or \"arya\", which were later added to the formula. The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:\n\nThis full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions, contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which didn't correct them. According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:\n\nAccording to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where \"dukkha\" is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the āsavas, the arising of the āsavas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\" \"The world\" refers to the saṅkhāras, that is, all compounded things, or to the six sense spheres.\n\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in five skandhas and twelve nidānas: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, Saṅkhāra ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The \"Twelve Nidānas\" describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.\n\nThe Pali terms \"ariya sacca\" (Sanskrit: \"arya satya\") are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations. According to Paul Williams,\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths. The term \"ariya\" (Sanskrit: \"arya\") can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\". \"pure\", Paul Williams:\nThe term \"sacca\" (Sanskrit: \"satya\") is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to Rupert Gethin, the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\" They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\" According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is \"the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha).\" It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing, Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.\n\nAccording to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:\nAs a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:\nAs a proposition, they are part of the matrix or \"network of teachings,\" in which they are \"not particularly central,\" but have an equal place next to other teachings, describing how release from craving is to be reached. A long recognized feature of the Theravada canon is that it lacks an \"overarching and comprehensive structure of the path to \"nibbana\".\" The sutras form a network or matrix, and the four truths appear within this \"network of teachings,\" which have to be taken together. Within this network, \"the four noble truths are one doctrine among others and are not particularly central,\" but are a part of \"the entire \"dhamma\" matrix.\" The four noble truths are be set and learnt in that network, learning \"how the various teachings intersect with each other,\" and refer to the various Buddhist techniques, which are all explicitly and implicitly part of the passages which refer to the four truths. According to Anderson,\nAs a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism: clinging and craving to temporary states and things is ultimately unsatisfactory and painful, \"dukkha\", and sustains \"samsara\", the repeated cycle of \"bhava\" (becoming, habitual tendencies) and \"jāti\" (\"birth,\" interpreted as either rebirth, the coming to be of a new existence; or as the arising of the sense of self as a mental phenomenon).\nBy following the Buddhist path, craving and clinging can be confined, peace of mind and real happiness\ncan be attained, and the repeated cycle of repeated becoming and birth will be stopped.\nThe truth of \"dukkha\", \"incapable of satisfying,\" \"painful,\" is the basic insight that life in this \"mundane world,\"\" with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things\" is \"dukkha\", unsatisfactory and painful. We expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness.\n\nThe truth of \"samudaya\", \"arising,\" \"coming together,\" or \"dukkha-samudaya\", the origination or arising of \"dukkha\", is the truth that repeated life in this world, and its associated \"dukkha\" arises, or continues, with taṇhā, \"thirst,\" craving for and clinging to these impermanent states and things.\n\nThe truth of \"nirodha\", cessation, or \"dukkha-nirodha\", the cessation of \"dukkha\", is the truth that \"dukkha\" ceases, or can be confined, when craving and clinging cease or are confined, and nirvana is attained. \"Nirvana\" refers to the moment of attainment itself, and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (\"khlesa-nirvana\"), but also to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (\"skandha-nirvana\" or \"parinirvana\"); in the Theravada-tradition, it also refers to a transcendental reality which is \"known at the moment of awakening.\" According to Gethin, \"modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience. When \"nirvana\" is attained, no more karma is being produced, and rebirth and dissatisfaction will no longer arise again. Cessation is \"nirvana\", \"blowing out,\" and peace of mind. Joseph Goldstein explains:\nThe truth of \"magga\", refers to the path to the cessation of, or liberation from \"dukkha\". By following the Noble Eightfold Path, to \"moksha\", liberation, restraining oneself, cultivating discipline, and practicing mindfulness and meditation, one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things, and rebirth and dissatisfaction will be ended. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. The Theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself.\n\nThe well-known eightfold path consists of the understanding that this world is fleeting and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this fleeting world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which means not feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; and the practice of \"dhyana\", meditation. The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.\n\nThe four truths are to be internalised, and understood or \"experienced\" personally, to turn them into a lived reality.\n\nThe four truths describe \"dukkha\" and its ending as a means to reach peace of mind in this life, but also as a means to end rebirth.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Samuel, \"the Four Noble Truths [...] describe the knowledge needed to set out on the path to liberation from rebirth.\" By understanding the four truths, one can stop this clinging and craving, attain a pacified mind, and be freed from this cycle of rebirth and redeath. Patrick Olivelle explains that moksha is a central concept in Indian religions, and \"literally means freedom from samsara.\" Melvin E. Spiro further explains that \"desire is the cause of suffering because desire is the cause of rebirth.\" When desire ceases, rebirth and its accompanying suffering ceases. Peter Harvey explains:\nThe last sermon, the \"Maha-parinibbana Sutta\" (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)\", states it as follows:\nAccording to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, \"birth\" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the \"emergence of the ego\". According to Buddhadhasa,\nSome contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking \"dukkha\" to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life, and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life. In the contemporary Vipassana movement that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the \"pursuit of happiness\" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.\n\nYet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, \"when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth\". \"Nibbana\" is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, \"without drastic changes in lifestyle\". Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives. The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia. According to Spiro, \"the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message,\" but an eschatological message.\n\nAccording to Anderson, \"the four truths are recognized as perhaps the most important teaching of the Buddha.\" Yet, as early as 1935 Caroline Rhys Davids wrote that for a teaching so central to Theravada Buddhism, it was missing from critical passages in the Pali canon. According to Gethin, the four truths and the eightfold path are only two lists of \"literally hundreds of similar lists covering the whole range of the theory and practice of ancient Buddhism.\" The position of the four truths within the canon raises questions, and has been investigated throughout the 19th and 20th century.\n\nAccording to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings. While the Theravada-tradition holds that the Sutta Pitaka is \"the definitive recension of the Buddha-word,\" and Theravadins argue that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission, academic scholars have identified many of such inconsistencies, and tried to explain them. Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism. According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha. According to Anderson,\nAccording to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order. They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for \"liberating insight\". From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.\n\nScholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They offer that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter. According to the Japanese scholar Ui, the four truths are not the earliest representation of the Buddha's enlightenment. Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of \"dhyana\", leading to a calm of mind and awareness (mindfulness) which according to Vetter \"is\" the liberation which is being sought. Later on, \"liberating insight\" came to be regarded as equally liberating. This \"liberating insight\" came to be exemplified by \"prajna\", or the insight in the \"four truths,\" but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of \"liberating insight\" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for \"moksha\", liberation from rebirth. This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\nAccording to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time. According to Bronkhorst, in earliest Buddhism the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\". Initially the term \"prajna\" served to denote this \"liberating insight.\" Later on, \"prajna\" was replaced in the suttas by the \"four truths.\" This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of \"liberating insight,\" and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in \"liberating insight.\" This \"liberating insight\" came to be defined as \"insight into the four truths,\" which is presented as the \"liberating insight\" which constituted the awakening, or \"enlightenment\" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was \"enlightened\" and liberated, as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: \"his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.\"\n\nBronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself. According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras. An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by \"pratityasamutpada\", and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.. Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon:\nIn contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, pratityasamutpada and anatta are inextricably intertwined .\n\nIn their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddh's path to awakening. In the \"Vinayapitaka\" and the \"Sutta-pitaka\" they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the \"dhamma-eye\". In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience. These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:\n\nYet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions. They do so in combination with the practice of the \"jhanas\" and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.\n\nAccording to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition. Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the \"āsavās\", where they substituted the unspecified \"liberating insight\"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.\n\nAccording to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism. According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to \"the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism.\" According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a \"simple, single rationalized account,\" which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.\n\nThe presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha \"has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists.\" There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety. The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are \"readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions.\" For example Walpola Rahula's \"What the Buddha Taught\", a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.\n\nAccording to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha. 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts. The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a \"superhuman\" to a \"compassionate, heroic human,\" serving \"western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine.\" The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.\n\nThe writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them. This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in socalled Protestant Buddhism, which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts. According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and \"was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada.\"\n\nHendrik Kern proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician. Kern's analogy became rather popular, but \"there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain.\"\n\nAccording to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either \"located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature,\" or \"located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting.\" According to Anderson, \"these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism.\"\n\nThe developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras. They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings. According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.\n\nThe \"Mahasaccaka Sutta\" (\"The Greater Discourse to Saccaka\", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation. He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints, the Four Noble Truths. After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:\nBronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of \"I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated\", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.\n\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of Gautama Buddha after he attained enlightenment is recorded in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" (\"Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma\", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:\n\nThese three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.\n\nAccording to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that \"this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date.\" According to Stephen Batchelor, the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" contains incongruities, and states that\nAccording to Bronkhorst this \"first sermon\" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations. In the Vinaya texts, and in the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened when the \"vision of Dhamma\" arises in him: \"whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.\" Yet, in the \"Ariyapariyesanā Sutta\" (\"The Noble Search\", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included, and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the \"first sermon\" which include the four truths, such as the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\", omit this instruction, showing that\nAccording to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas. Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the \"twelve insights\" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term \"prajna\" for the more specific \"four truths\".\n\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the \"Maha-parinibbana Sutta\" (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta \"gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:\"\n\nThe \"Maha-salayatanika Sutta\", Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:\n\nThe Ekavyāvahārika sect emphasized the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight. According to the Mahīśāsaka sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.\n\nAccording to Carol Anderson, the four truths have \"a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.\" The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself. As Walpola Rahula states, \"when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of samsara in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming.\" This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together. Within the Theravada tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating \"The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth\", and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice. For example, Ajahn Sumedho states: \nWithin the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on \"nirvana\" and the question what happens with the \"Arhat\" after death can be found. \"Nirvana\" refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (\"khlesa-nirvana\"); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (\"skandha-nirvana\" or \"parinirvana\"); and to a transcendental reality which is \"known at the moment of awakening.\" According to Gethin, \"modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience. According to Geisler and Amano, in the \"minimal Theravada interpretation\", \"nirvana\" is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence. According to Geisler and Amano, the \"orthodox Theravada interpretation\" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites. According to Bronkhorst, while \"Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death,\" there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this \nAccording to Walpola Rahula, the cessation of \"dukkha\" is \"nirvana\", the \"summum bonum\" of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies. \"Nirvana\" is \"perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness,\" and \"Absolute Truth,\" which simply \"is\". Jayatilleke also speaks of \"the attainment of an ultimate reality.\" According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the \"elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of reapeated rebirth.\"\n\nAccording to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for \"nirvana\" and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven. According to Spiro, this presents a \"serious conflict\" since the Buddhist texts and teaching \"describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the \"summum bonum.\"\" In response to this deviation, \"monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action.\" Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is \"nirvana\".\n\nAccording to B.R. Ambedkar, the Indian Buddhist Dalit leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences. According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.\n\nThe four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into Śūnyatā and the Bodhisattva path as a central elements in their teachings. If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.\n\nAccording to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths. In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave \"samsara\", but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings. The four truths, which aim at ending \"samsara\", do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted. In the old view, \"klesas\" and \"karma\" are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, \"[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth).\" According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be \"pervasively operative in this world\" has been \"a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet.\"\n\nAtisha, in his \"Bodhipathapradīpa\" (\"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\"), which forms the basis for the Lamrim tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners. At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in \"samsara\". At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering. At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation of all living beings. In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.\n\nAccording to Geshe Tashi Tsering, within Tibetan Buddhism, the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the \"Abhisamayalamkara\", a summary of and commentary on the Prajna Paramitra sutras, where they form part of the lower Hinayana teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of five paths, rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada. According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the sixteen characteristics of the four noble truths.\n\nSome contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the \"Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta\" and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is based on the teaching of the Japanese priest and teacher Nichiren, who believed that the Lotus Sūtra contained the essence of all of Gautama Buddha's teachings. The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra states that the Four Noble Truths was the early teaching of the Buddha, while the Dharma of the Lotus is the \"most wonderful, unsurpassed great Dharma.\" The teachings on the four noble truths are a provisional teaching, which Shakyamuni Buddha taught according to the people’s capacity, while the Lotus Sutra is a direct statement of Shakyamuni’s own enlightenment.\n\nFor many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion. According to Lamb, \"Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion.\" According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west \"is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom.\" According to Damien Keown, westerners find \"the ideas of karma and rebirth puzzling.\" According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths. According to Konik,\nAccording to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is nirvana, and not rebirth. Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as \"naturalized Buddhism\". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms. This \"deflated secular Buddhism\" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalists approach to well-being of oneself and others.\n\nAccording to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to \"why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of \"dukkha\" in current life by ending life\". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the \"dukkha\" and the path to cessation of \"dukkha\" isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths. The \"naturalized Buddhism\", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia. According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, realms of existence and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.\n\nTraditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that \"modernist interpreters of Buddhism\" seem to have with it. Thanissaro Bhikkhu, as another example, rejects the \"modern argument\" that \"one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth.\" He states, \"rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition.\"\n\nAccording to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that \"Buddhists believe in rebirth\" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as reincarnation--rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an \"atman, self, soul\", but rather through a \"consciousness conceived along the anatman lines\". The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.\n\nAccording to Christopher Gowans, for \"most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth\". Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations. According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.\n\nThe Navayana, a modernistic interpretation of Buddhism by the Indian leader B. R. Ambedkar, rejected much of traditional Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths, karma and rebirth, thus turning his new religion into a Marxist-oriented vehicle for class struggle and social action. According to Ambedkar, Four Noble Truths was \"the invention of wrong-headed monks\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "102866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102866", "title": "Gay bashing", "text": "Gay bashing\n\nGay bashing and gay bullying is verbal or physical abuse against a person who is perceived by the aggressor to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, including persons who identify as heterosexual.\n\nA \"bashing\" may be a specific incident, and one could also use the verb \"to bash\" (e.g. \"I was gay bashed.\"). A verbal gay bashing might use sexual slurs, expletives, intimidation, and threatened or actual violence. It also might take place in a political forum and include one or more common anti-gay slogans.\n\nGay bullying involves intentional and unprovoked actions toward the victim, repeated negative actions by one or more people against another person, and an imbalance of physical or psychological power. Similar terms such as \"lesbian bullying\", \"queer bullying\", and \"queer bashing\" may also be formed.\n\nGay bashing has occurred worldwide for many decades and continues today. Homophobia in the United States was especially serious in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when many gay people were forced out of government by boards set up by Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. As historian David K. Johnson explains:\n\nJohnson concludes that Senator Joe McCarthy, notorious for his attacks on alleged communists in government, was often pressured by his allies to denounce homosexuals in government, but he resisted and did not do so. Using rumors collected by Drew Pearson, one Nevada publisher wrote in 1952 that both McCarthy and his chief counsel, Roy Cohn, were homosexuals. \"Washington Post\" editor Benjamin C. Bradlee said, \"There was a lot of time spent investigating\" these allegations, \"although no one came close to proving it.\" No reputable McCarthy biographer has accepted it as probable.\n\nEgale Canada conducted a survey of more than 3700 high school students in Canada between December 2007 and June 2009. The final report of the survey, \"Every Class in Every School\", published in 2011, found that 70% of all students participating heard \"that's so gay\" daily at school, and 48% of respondents heard \"faggot\", \"lezbo\" and \"dyke\" daily. 58% or about 1400 of the 2400 heterosexual students participating in EGALE's survey found homophobic comments upsetting.\nFurther, EGALE found that students not directly affected by homophobia, biphobia or transphobia were less aware of it. This finding relates to research done in the area of empathy gaps for social pain which suggests that those not directly experiencing social pain (in this case, bullying) consistently underestimate its effects and thus may not adequately respond to the needs of one experiencing social pain.\n\nEGALE, along with previous research has found teachers and school administration may be complicit in queer bullying through their silence and/or inaction.\n\nGraffiti found on school grounds and property, and its \"relative permanence\", is another form of queer bullying.\n\nSome researchers suggest including youth questioning their sexuality in any research on queer bullying because they may be as susceptible to its effects as queer students.\n\nA research study of 78 eleven to fourteen-year-old boys conducted in twelve schools in London, England between 1998 and 1999 revealed that respondents who used the word \"gay\" to label another boy in a derogatory manner intended the word as \"just a joke\", \"just a cuss\" and not as a statement of one's perceived sexual orientation. American sociologist Michael Kimmel and American psychologist Gregory Herek write that masculinity is a renunciation of the feminine and that males shore up their sense of their masculinity by denigrating the feminine and ultimately the homosexual. Building on the notion of masculinity defining itself by what it is not, some researchers suggest that in fact the renunciation of the feminine may be misogyny. These intertwining issues were examined in 2007, when American sociologist CJ Pascoe described what she calls the \"fag discourse\" at an American high school in her book, \"Dude, You're a Fag\".\n\nGay and lesbian youth are more likely to report bullying. In one study, boys who were bullied with taunts of being gay suffered more bullying and more negative effects compared with boys who were bullied with other categories of taunting.\n\nGay and lesbian youth can develop severe forms of depression and anxiety as they grow up. In fact, 71.4% of LGBT folk experience major depression disorder (MDD). For LGBT individuals, MDD can be caused by any of the following: self-esteem, pressure to conform, minority stress, coming out, family rejection, parenting, relationship formation, and violence. Self-esteem and pressure to conform go hand in hand. When an LGBT individual is told what to look like and who to love, it puts a toll on their self-esteem. When people make comments about who they are, what they look like, who they love, etc. it begins to make them feel insecure. It makes them feel as though they aren't good enough the way they are. \"Coming-out\" is a terms that is used to describe when an LGBT individual makes it known that they are gay, lesbian, etc. Coming out is usually the first factor that will affect a person involved in the LGBT community because when they first discover who they really are, their instinct is to confide in their parents to help them through it (Markheim, Personal Interview). When they experience family rejection after coming out, they automatically feel unwanted and unloved. This can set them into a downward spiral of depression. Parenting and relationship formation are very closely related because usually, people feel more comfortable parenting with their significant other rather than alone, especially if they are involved in the LGBT community. Just recently, in March 2016, is became legal for LGBT parents to adopt in all 50 states. Not being able to conceive their own child can already cause depression, but when they were denied the right to adopt, it caused even more pain. Minority stress is not the biggest of all the factors, but it doesn't make anybody feel better. Minority stress is defined as a stress experienced by LGBT individuals due to their sexual orientation/gender identity. Violence can slip anybody into a depressed state whether the violence is a type of physical abuse, mental abuse, or verbal abuse. A person can be harassed to the point where their depression becomes to much and they no longer experience any happiness. These factors all work together and make it extremely hard to avoid MDD.\n\nQueer bullying may make some victims feel sad and unsafe in the world. Bullying will affect a student's experience of school. Some victims might feel paralyzed and withdraw socially as a coping mechanism. Other victims of queer bullying may begin to live the effects of learned helplessness. Queer or questioning students may try to pass as heterosexual in order to avoid queer bullying. Passing isolates the student from other queer or questioning students, potential allies, and support. Adults who try to pass also may feel the effects emotionally and psychologically, of this effort to conceal their true identities.\nQueer and questioning youth who experience bullying have a higher incidence of substance abuse and STI and HIV infection, which may carry through to adulthood.\nQueer bullying may also be seen as a manifestation of what American academic Ilan Meyer calls \"minority stress\", which may affect sexual and ethno-racial minorities attempting to exist within a challenging broader society.\n\nHomophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings can be categorized as explicit and implicit. Explicit homophobic and transphobic violence consists of overt acts that make subjects feel uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated or intimidated. Peers and educational staff are unlikely to intervene when witnessing these incidents. This contributes to normalizing such acts that become accepted as either a routine disciplinary measure or a means to resolve conflicts among students. Homophobic and transphobic violence – as with all school-related gender-based violence – is acutely underreported due to subjects’ fear of retribution, combined with inadequate or non-existent reporting, support and redress systems. The absence of effective policies, protection or remedies contributes to a vicious cycle where incidents become increasingly normal.\n\nImplicit homophobic and transphobic violence, sometimes called ‘symbolic violence’ or ‘institutional’ violence, is subtler than explicit violence. It consists of pervasive representations or attitudes that sometimes feel harmless or natural to the school community, but that allow or encourage homophobia and transphobia, including perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Policies and guidelines can reinforce or embed these representations or attitudes, whether in an individual institution or across an entire education sector. This way, they can become part of everyday practices and rules guiding school behaviour. Examples of implicit homophobic and transphobic violence include:\n\n\nTeens face harassment, threats, and violence. A 1998 study in the US by Mental Health America found that students heard anti-gay slurs such as \"homo\", \"faggot\" and \"sissy\" about 26 times a day on average, or once every 14 minutes. In a study conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, a union for UK professionals, the word \"gay\" was reported to be the most popular term of abuse heard by teachers on a regular basis.\n\nAbout two-thirds of gay and lesbian students in British schools have suffered from gay bullying in 2007, according to a study done by the Schools Education Unit for LGB activist group Stonewall. Almost all that had been bullied had experienced verbal attacks, 41 percent had been physically attacked, and 17 percent had received death threats. It also showed that over 50% of teachers did not respond to homophobic language which they had explicitly heard in the classroom, and only 25% of schools had told their students that homophobic bullying was wrong, showing \"a shocking picture of the extent of homophobic bullying undertaken by fellow pupils and, alarmingly, school staff\", with further studies conducted by the same charity in 2012 stated that 90% of teachers had had no training on the prevention of homophobic bullying. However, Ofsted's new 2012 framework did ask schools what they would be doing in order to combat the issue.\n\nThe rate of suicide is higher among LGBT people. According to a 1979 Jay and Young study, 40 percent of gay men and 39 percent of gay women in the US had attempted or seriously thought about suicide. In the same study conducted by the Schools Education Unit for LGB activist group Stonewall, an online survey reported that 71 percent of the girl participants who identified as LGBTQ, and 57 percent of the boy participants who identified as LGBTQ had seriously considered suicide. In 1985, F. Paris estimated that suicides by gay youth may comprise up to 30 percent of all youth suicides in the US. This contributes to suicide being the third leading cause for death among youth aged 10–24, reported by the CDC. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has found that gay, lesbian and bisexual youth attempt suicide at a rate three to six times that of similar-age heterosexual youth. The Schools Education Unit also reports that in the same online survey, 25 percent of the people who identified as LGBTQ, have attempted to commit suicide.\n\n\nThe state of Illinois passed a law (SB3266) in June 2010 that prohibits gay bullying and other forms of bullying in schools.\n\nIn the Philippines, legislators implemented Republic Act No. 10627, otherwise known as the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, in schools. According to the said law, gender-based bullying is defined as ˮany act that humiliates or excludes a person on the basis of perceived or actual sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)ˮ.\n\nIn response to growing awareness of gay bashing and bullying, a number of support groups have been founded to help LGBT people cope with their abuse. In Europe Stonewall UK, and Anti-Bullying Network are active in the UK, while Russia has the Russian LGBT network.\n\nNotable in the United States is the It Gets Better Project, for which celebrities and ordinary LGBT people make YouTube videos and share messages of hope for gay teens. The organization works with USA, The Trevor Project and the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. The Safe Schools Coalition provides resources for teachers and students where bullying is a problem. Egale Canada works with LGBT Canadian citizens. In Brazil, the Gay Group of Bahia (Grupo Gay da Bahia) provides support. LGBT South Africans can turn to the South African Human Rights Commission.\n\n\n"}

A simplified example of the halo effect is when an individual noticing that the person in the photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, assumes, using a mental heuristic, that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of that individual's social concept. This constant error in judgment is reflective of the individual's preferences, prejudices, ideology, aspirations, and social perception. The halo effect is an evaluation by an individual and can affect the perception of a decision, action, idea, business, person, group, entity, or other whenever concrete data is generalized or influences ambiguous information.\n\nThe halo effect can also be explained as the behavior (usually unconscious) of using evaluations based on things unrelated, to make judgments about something or someone. The halo effect specifically refers to when this behavior has a positive correlation, such as viewing someone who is attractive as likely to be successful and popular. When this judgement has a negative connotation, such as someone unattractive being more readily blamed for a crime than someone attractive, it is referred to as the horn effect.\n\nThe halo effect was named by psychologist Edward Thorndike in reference to a person being perceived as having a halo. He gave the phenomenon its name in his 1920 article \"A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings\". In \"Constant Error\", Thorndike set out to replicate the study in hopes of pinning down the bias that he thought was present in these ratings. Subsequent researchers have studied it in relation to attractiveness and its bearing on the judicial and educational systems. Thorndike originally coined the term referring only to people; however, its use has been greatly expanded especially in the area of brand marketing.\n\nIn \"A Constant Error in Psychological Ratings\", Thorndike asked two commanding officers to evaluate their soldiers in terms of physical qualities (neatness, voice, physique, bearing, and energy), intellect, leadership skills, and personal qualities (including dependability, loyalty, responsibility, selflessness, and cooperation). His goal was to see how the ratings of one characteristic affected other characteristics.\n\nThorndike's study showed how there was too great a correlation in the commanding officers' responses. In his review he stated: \"The correlations are too high and too even. For example, for the three raters next studied[,] the average correlation for physique with intelligence is .31; for physique with leadership, .39; and for physique with character, .28\". The ratings of one of the special qualities of an officer often started a trend in the rating results. If an officer had a particular \"negative\" attribute given off to the commanding officer, it would correlate in the rest of that soldier's results.\n\nThe term \"halo\" is used in analogy with the religious concept: a glowing circle crowning the heads of saints in countless medieval and Renaissance paintings, bathing the saint's face in heavenly light. The observer may be subject to overestimating the worth of the observed by the presence of a quality that adds light on the whole like a halo. In other words, observers tend to bend their judgement according to one patent characteristic of the person (the \"halo\"), generalizing towards a judgement of that person's character (e.g., in the literal hagiologic case, \"entirely good and worthy\").\n\nThe effect works in both positive and negative directions (and is hence sometimes called the horns and halo effect). If the observer likes one aspect of something, they will have a positive predisposition toward everything about it. If the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition toward everything about it.\n\nA person's attractiveness has also been found to produce a halo effect. Attractiveness provides a valuable aspect of the halo effect to consider because of its multifaceted nature; attractiveness may be influenced by several specific traits. These perceptions of attractiveness may affect judgments tied to personality traits. Physical attributes contribute to perceptions of attractiveness (e.g., weight, hair, eye color). For example, someone who is perceived as attractive, due in part to physical traits, may be more likely to be perceived as kind or intelligent. The role of attractiveness in producing the halo effect has been illustrated through a number of studies. Recent research, for example, has revealed that attractiveness may affect perceptions tied to life success and personality. In this study, attractiveness was correlated with weight, indicating that attractiveness itself may be influenced by various specific traits. Included in the personality variables were trustworthiness and friendliness. People perceived as being more attractive were more likely to be perceived as trustworthy and friendly. What this suggests is that perceptions of attractiveness may influence a variety of other traits, which supports the concept of the halo effect.\n\n conducted a study on the relationship between attractiveness and the halo effect. Sixty students, thirty male and thirty female) from the University of Minnesota took part in the experiment. Each subject was given three different photos to examine: one of an attractive individual, one of an individual of average attractiveness, and one of an unattractive individual.\n\nThe participants judged the photos' subjects along 27 different personality traits (including altruism, conventionality, self-assertiveness, stability, emotionality, trustworthiness, extraversion, kindness, and sexual promiscuity). Participants were then asked to predict the overall happiness the photos' subjects would feel for the rest of their lives, including marital happiness (least likely to get divorced), parental happiness (most likely to be a good parent), social and professional happiness (most likely to experience life fulfillment), and overall happiness. Finally, participants were asked if the subjects would hold a job of high status, medium status, or low status.\n\nResults showed that most of the participants overwhelmingly believed more attractive subjects have more socially desirable personality traits than either averagely attractive or unattractive subjects. Participants also believed that attractive individuals would lead happier lives in general, have happier marriages, and have more career success than the others. Also, results showed that attractive people were believed to be more likely to hold secure, prestigious jobs compared to unattractive individuals. Participants however believed that attractive individuals would be worse parents than both average attractive and unattractive individuals.\n\nA study by demonstrated the Halo Effect, looking at judgments of intelligence and competence on academic tasks. Sixty male undergraduate students rated the quality of essays which included both well and poorly written samples. One third were presented with a photo of an attractive female as author, another third with that of an unattractive female as author, and the last third were shown neither. In average most of the participants gave significantly better writing evaluations for the more attractive author. On a scale of 1 to 9, the well-written essay by the attractive author received an average of 6.7 while the unattractive author received a 5.9 (with a 6.6 as a control). The gap was larger on the poor essay: the attractive author received an average of 5.2, the control a 4.7, and the unattractive a 2.7, suggesting readers are generally more willing to give physically attractive people the benefit of the doubt when performance is below standard than others.\n\nResearch conducted by Moore, Filippou, & Perrett (2011), sought residual cues to intelligence in female and male faces while attempting to control for the attractiveness halo effect. Over 300 photographs of Caucasian British college students were rated for perceived intelligence. The photographs that were scored lowest in low perceived intelligence were used to create a low-intelligence composite face and those photographs that were scored highest for high perceived intelligence were used to create a high-intelligence composite face. Both female and male, of high- and low- perceived intelligence were created resulting in four groups of composite faces. Participants for the study were recruited online; 164 female and 92 male heterosexual residents of the UK rated each of the composite faces for intelligence and attractiveness. Of the female composites, attractiveness seemed to be controlled as both the high- and low- perceived intelligence groups were rated as equally attractive. However, of the male face composites, the high-perceived intelligence group was rated as significantly more attractive than the low-perceived intelligence group, suggesting that either the authors could not adequately control for the attractiveness halo effect for the male composite photographs or that intelligence is an integral factor of attractiveness in high intelligent male faces. The second part of the study found that the composites in the high-perceived intelligence group were rated highest in the factors of friendly and funny as markers of intelligence in both the female and male group. While intelligence does not seem to be a factor that contributes to attractiveness in women, with regards to men, attractive faces are perceived to be more intelligent, friendly, and funny by women and men.\n\nA study by found that attractiveness and familiarity are strong predictors of decisions regarding who is put in a position of leadership. Judgments made following one-second exposures to side-by-side photos of two US congressional candidates were reasonably predictive of election outcomes. Attractiveness and familiarity were correlated with competence in this study. Candidates who appeared more attractive and familiar were also seen as more competent and were found more likely to be elected. Similar studies found that even when taking factual knowledge into account, candidates who were rated as more attractive were still perceived as more knowledgeable. These results suggest that the halo effect greatly impacts how individuals perceive political knowledge and it demonstrates the powerful influence of the halo effect in politics.\n\nStudy results showing the influence of the halo effect in the judicial context exist:\n\n\nA study by yielded much of the same results as are seen in other studies focusing on the halo effect—attractive individuals were rated more highly in qualities such as creativity, intelligence, and sensitivity than unattractive individuals. However, in addition to these results Kaplan found that some women were influenced by the halo effect on attractiveness only when presented with members of the opposite sex. When presented with an attractive member of the same sex, the effect was attenuated for some women. continue this line of research, going on to demonstrate that jealousy of an attractive individual has slight effect in evaluation of that person. Their work shows this to be more prevalent among females than males, with some females being less influenced by the halo effect. Later research by Moore, Filippou, & Perrett (2011) was able to control for attractiveness in composite photographs of females who were perceived to be of high or low intelligence, while showing that the attractiveness halo effect was seen in high intelligent male composite faces by heterosexual residents of the UK. Either the halo effect is negated by feelings of jealousy in women or the halo effect is lessened when women are looking at same sex individuals or the attractiveness halo effect can be controlled for in women it appears that there is a difference in affect produced by the attractiveness halo effect at least between binary genders.\n\n have reasoned that if the following four assumptions were true, beautiful people are indeed likely to be more intelligent and provided empirical evidence for these assumptions.\n\nThe reverse halo effect occurs when positive evaluations of an individual cause negative consequences. Dermer and Thiel (1975) had female undergraduates rate pictures of highly attractive, moderately attractive, and unattractive females and evaluate them on a number of dimensions. Their hypothesis that jealousy would moderate attractiveness ratings was partially supported. Unattractive raters did not rate attractive females as highly, and thought that they would be less competent parents and more likely to cheat. A follow up study with both men and women participants supported this, as well as showing that attractive women were expected to be conceited and have a higher socioeconomic status. Eagly et al. (1991) also commented on this phenomenon, showing that more attractive individuals of all sexes were expected to be higher in vanity and possibly egotistic. Applied instances of the reverse halo effect include negative evaluations of criminals who use their attractiveness to their advantage (Sigall & Ostrove, 1975) and rating a philosophical essay lower when written by a young female than an old male.\n\nThe horn effect occurs when people allow an undesirable trait to influence their evaluation of other traits. \"The Guardian\" wrote of the devil effect in relation to Hugo Chavez: \"Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way.\" When someone is seen in a negative light, anything they do that is negative is exemplified, while the positive things they do are not seen, or are doubted.\n\n found the halo effect is also present in the classroom. In this study, both regular and special education elementary school teachers watched videotapes of what they believed to be children in regular 4th-grade classrooms. In reality, the children were actors, depicting behaviors present in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), or standard behavior. The teachers were asked to rate the frequency of hyperactive behaviors observed in the children. Teachers rated hyperactive behaviors accurately for children with ADHD; however, the ratings of hyperactivity were much higher for the children with ODD-like behaviors, showing a halo effect for children with ODD.\n\n\"In the classroom, teachers are subject to the halo effect rating error when evaluating their students. For example, a teacher who sees a well-behaved student might tend to assume this student is also bright, diligent, and engaged before that teacher has objectively evaluated the student's capacity in these areas. When these types of halo effects occur, they can affect students' approval ratings in certain areas of functioning and can even affect students' grades.\"\n\n\"In the work setting, the halo effect is most likely to show up in a supervisor's appraisal of a subordinate's job performance. In fact, the halo effect is probably the most common bias in performance appraisal. Think about what happens when a supervisor evaluates the performance of a subordinate. The supervisor may give prominence to a single characteristic of the employee, such as enthusiasm, and allow the entire evaluation to be colored by how he or she judges the employee on that one characteristic. Even though the employee may lack the requisite knowledge or ability to perform the job successfully, if the employee's work shows enthusiasm, the supervisor may very well give him or her a higher performance rating than is justified by knowledge or ability.\"\n\nThe term halo effect is used in marketing to explain customer bias toward certain products because of favorable experience with other products made by the same company.\n\nThe halo effect is also present in the field of brand marketing. One common halo effect is when the perceived positive features of a particular item extend to a broader brand. A notable example is the manner in which the popularity of Apple's iPod generated enthusiasm for the corporation's other products.\n\nA halo effect with regard to health, dubbed a \"health halo\", is used in food marketing to increase sales of a product; it can result in increased consumption of the product in the halo which may be unhealthy.\n\nThe term \"halo effect\" has also been applied to human rights organizations that have used their status to move away from their stated goals. Political scientist Gerald Steinberg has claimed that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) take advantage of the halo effect and are \"given the status of impartial moral watchdogs\" by governments and the news media.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House, a widely known NGO, openly celebrates the positive outcomes it receives from the halo effect. The web page for the Ronald McDonald House in Durham, North Carolina, states that 95% of survey participants were aware of Ronald McDonald House Charities. This awareness is attributed to the halo effect, as employees, customers, and stakeholders are more likely to be involved in a charity that they recognize and trust, with a name and logo that are familiar.\n\nA brand's halo effect can protect its reputation in the event of a crisis. An event that is detrimental to a brand that is viewed favorably would not be as threatening or damaging to a brand that consumers view unfavorably.\n\nNon-psychology/business use of the term \"halo effect\" can refer to the monetary value of expenditures either in subsequent time periods.\n\nA published 2012 study included this additional usage as \"Lastly, there are halo effects; for instance, spend on TV was found to be influencing response in other channels.\"\n\nOften, a person's character is perceived in a more positive light after their death. An example of this is what took place after Michael Jackson died in 2009. Before Jackson's death, he was only a few years removed from accusations of sexual molestation of minors. The public deemed him a \"child molester\" and \"sex offender\". However, since his death discussion of sexual misconduct has subsided and public perception mainly focuses on his success and status as the King of Pop.\n\n argue: \"Since 1980, there have been a large number of studies dealing directly or indirectly with halo error in rating. Taken together, these studies suggest that all seven of the characteristics that have defined halo error for much of its history are problematic and that the assumptions that underlie some of them are demonstrably wrong.\" Their work claims that the assumption that the halo effect is always detrimental is incorrect, with some halo effects resulting in an increase in the accuracy of the rating, in their opinion. Additionally, they discuss the idea of \"true halo\"—the actual correlation between, for example, attractiveness and performance as an instructor—and \"illusory halo\" that refers to cognitive distortions, errors in observation and judgement, and the rating tendencies of the individual rater. They claim that any true differentiation between true and illusory halos is impossible in a real-world setting, because the different ratings are strongly influenced by the specific behaviors of the person observed by the raters.\n\nA study by states that one's mood can affect the degree of the halo effect's influence. When someone is in a favorable mood, the halo effect is more likely to be influential—this was demonstrated by study participants choosing between pictures of an elderly man with a beard and a young woman, and deciding which subject possessed more philosophical attributes. Additionally, when asked to list the happy times in their life, the halo effect was more evident in the perceptions of the participants. Forgas's study suggests that when one is gauging the extent of the halo effect in a situation, one must consider the emotional state of the person making the judgment.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42182708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42182708", "title": "Karl May Museum", "text": "Karl May Museum\n\nThe Karl May Museum is a museum in Radebeul, Germany named after the German author Karl May, containing artifacts from May's life as well as from life on the American frontier and Native American life of that era.\n\nGerman author Karl May (1842–1912), wrote many books about the American frontier and Native Americans featuring the fictional characters Winnetou (a Mescalero-Apache Chief) and Old Shatterhand (a white European settler). Mays' books were popular in Germany and created a mystique about the \"Wild West\" in German popular culture. \n\nThe museum opened in 1928 in Radebeul, in the house where May had lived, called Villa Shatterhand. It was founded during a peak of interest in the US frontier and native Americans, fostered in part by the Sarrasani circus, which was headquartered in nearby Dresden, and which was very popular in the 1920s. Sarassani and Native American members of the circus came to the opening, and the Native Americans performed death songs for May. \n\nThe museum was founded by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named , who was a fan of May's work and had travelled to the American frontier, and liked to tell tall tales about his time there. Tobis donated a large collection of artifacts to help found the museum's collection, which included 17 scalps, some of them from Native Americans.\n\nWhen the Nazis took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork. Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and to hear stories from Tobis.\n\nAfter World War II, the original museum was in East Germany and a replica was built in Bamburg in West Germany. A person who called himself Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance became associated with the museum shortly after the war ended. \n\nFrom 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the \"Indianer Museum\", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government, in part because of the association with the Nazis, but also because the books were viewed as leading people to want to travel, which the government did not allow. During the Cold War placards in the museum in Radebeul and its displays were refactored to describe oppression of Native Americans by the US, as part of Soviet propaganda efforts to rally indigenous people against the West. Some East Germans also did work with the American Indian Movement. \n\nThe museum in Radebul was given its original name again in 1986, as the East German government moved to reclaim May. The renaming led to an exhibition focused on May in February, which had 4,000 visitors a day, and people waited for three hours outside to get in. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, attendance at the Radebul museum dropped from around 300,000 people per year to around 60,000, as people could travel to the US instead of visiting the museum, which had been one of the only sources of information about Native Americans in East Germany. \n\nIn 2010, according to the \"South China Morning Post\", US activists began seeking repatriation of the scalps. Berlin-based journalist Mark Worth brought the scalps to the attention of Karen Little Coyote of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, who wrote a letter asking for the scalps to be returned in the fall of 2013. In 2013, the German Museums Association issued a guideline on the care of human remains, listing scalps from peoples who \"fashioned trophies from the heads of their killed enemies\" as an exception to \"human remains acquired in a context of injustice\". In March 2014, Cecil E. Pavlat, who works on return of artifacts for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, wrote a letter asking for return of the scalps. Later in 2014, the Museum agreed to turn the scalps over to another institution for authentication. The Museum had not returned the scalps as of 2016, saying there were doubts about the original story of the provenance of the 17 scalps, although they did remove them from public display.\n\nThe director of the museum in Radebul from 1985 to 2014 was René Wagner; Christian Wacker was appointed director in 2018.\n\nThe museum received a donation of new artifacts in 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "6962248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6962248", "title": "Kashaya (Jainism)", "text": "Kashaya (Jainism)\n\nIn Jainism, Kashaya (loose translation: \"Passion\") are aspects of a person that can be gained during his or her worldly life. According to the Jaina religion as long as a person has Kashayas, they will not escape the cycle of life and death. There are four different kind of Kashayas, each being able to gain their own kinds of intensity.\n\nAccording to the Jain text, \"Sarvārthasiddhi\", \"He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial.\"\n\nSpiritually, the goal of Jainism is to rid oneself of the worldly life and become free from the cycle of reincarnation. When one develop attachment or passions, this hinders the spiritual progress of their soul. Jainas believe that by reacting without passion and staying tranquil, one can break the cycle which forms more karma.\n\nThe four \"kasaya\" are: \"krodha\" (anger), \"lobha\" (greed), \"mana\" (ego) and \"maya\" (deceit). Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of \"bandha\" or bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (\"kaṣāyas\") because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in \"bandha\". The karmic inflow on account of \"yoga\" driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect. Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions: Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one needs to remember to forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one needs to remember to give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego) is humility, one needs to be humble. Opposite of Deceit is honesty, one needs to be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas. \n\nMost difficult Kashaya to overcome is Greed. \n\nWhen he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.\n\n—\"Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39\"\n\n\nThe degrees of strength of the kasayas are illustrated by examples. The 4 species of anger are to be likened unto a line drawn in stone, in earth, in dust and in water. The first can only be removed with great effort, each following one always more easily. Likewise also, the lifelong enduring anger is only combated in its effect with exceeding strength and difficulty whilst the effect of the three remaining species accordingly diminishes in power and can, therefore, also more easily be destroyed. The degrees of pride are to be likened unto a pillar of stone, a bone, a piece of wood, and the vine of a creeper; the inflexibility correspondingly decreases. The species of deceitfulness are to be compared to a bamboo root, the horn of a ram, the urine of a cow, and a piece of wood. The crookedness of each of these is removed more easily than in the one preceding it. (The zig zag line of the cow's urine disappears through the influence of wind and weather.) The degrees of greed correspond to scarlet colour, to greater or smaller dirt, and to a spot of turmeric, which soil a garment: the scarlet is hardly removable, the dirt with more or less trouble, and the spot of turmeric can be removed with ease.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1082450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1082450", "title": "Land law", "text": "Land law\n\nLand law is the form of law that deals with the rights to use, alienate, or exclude others from land. In many jurisdictions, these kinds of property are referred to as real estate or real property, as distinct from personal property. Land use agreements, including renting, are an important intersection of property and contract law. Encumbrance on the land rights of one, such as an easement, may constitute the land rights of another. Mineral rights and water rights are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.\n\nLand rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the claim clubs of the American West were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. Squatting, the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.\n\nSovereignty, in common law jurisdictions, is often referred to as absolute title, radical title, or allodial title. Nearly all of these jurisdictions have a system of land registration, to record fee simple interests, and a land claim process to resolve disputes.\n\nIndigenous land rights are recognized by international law, as well as the national legal systems of common law and civil law countries. In common law jurisdictions, the land rights of indigenous peoples are referred to as aboriginal title. In customary law jurisdictions, customary land is the predominant form of land ownership.\n\nLand reform refers to government policies that take and/or redistribute land, such as a land grant.\n\nLand rights refer to the inalienable ability of individuals to freely obtain, use, and possess land at their discretion, as long as their activities on the land do not impede on other individuals’ rights. This is not to be confused with access to land, which allows individuals the use of land in an economic sense (i.e. farming). Instead, land rights address the ownership of land which provides security and increases human capabilities. When a person only has access to land, they are in constant threat of expulsion depending on the choices of the land owner, which limits financial stability.\n\nLand rights are an integral part of Land Laws, as they socially enforce groups of individuals’ rights to own land in concurrence with the land laws of a nation. Land Law addresses the legal mandates set forth by a country in regards to land ownership, while land rights refer to the social acceptance of land ownership. Landesa takes the stance that although the law may advocate for equal access to land, land rights in certain countries and cultures may hinder a group’s right to actually own land. Laws are important, but they must be backed up by cultural tradition and social acceptance. Therefore, laws concerning land ownership and land rights of a country must be in agreement.\n\nGlobally, there has been an increased focus on land rights, as they are so pertinent to various aspects of development. According to Wickeri and Kalhan, land ownership can be a critical source of capital, financial security, food, water, shelter, and resources. The UN Global Land Tool organisation has found that rural landlessness is a strong predictor of poverty and hunger, and negatively impacts Empowerment and the realisation of Human rights. In order to home in on this critical problem of inadequate land rights, The Millennium Development Goal 7D strives to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers. This includes increased land rights for impoverished people, which will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.\n\nAlthough land rights are fundamental in achieving higher standards of living, certain groups of individuals are consistently left out of land ownership provisions. The law may provide access to land, however, cultural barriers and poverty traps limit minority groups’ ability to own land. In order to reach equality, these groups must obtain adequate land rights that are both socially and legally recognised.\n\nSeveral scholars argue that women’s lack of sufficient land rights negatively affects their immediate families and the larger community, as well. With land ownership, women can develop an income and allocate this income more fairly within the household. Tim Hanstad claims that providing sufficient land rights for women is beneficial because, once women can exercise those rights the following will be promoted:\n\nIn many parts of the world, women have access to land in order to farm and cultivate the land; however, there are traditions and cultural norms which bar women from inheriting or purchasing land. This puts women in a place of dependence on their husbands, brothers, or fathers for their livelihood and shelter. Should there be an illness, domestic violence, or death in the family, women would be left landless and unable to either grow crops for food, or rent land for profit. Land ownership for women is a crucial form of security and income, increasing Empowerment and decreasing Poverty.\n\nKanakalatha Mukund makes the important point that although women in India have the legal right to own land, very few actually do as a result of the patriarchal practices which dominate the nation. Up until recently, Indian women have been left out of laws regarding the distribution of public land and were forced to rely on the small possibility of obtaining private land from their families. Inheritance laws which cater towards men are one of the key issues behind inequality in land rights. According to Bina Agarwal, land ownership defines social status and political power in the household and in the village, shaping relationships and creating family dynamics. Therefore, inheritance of land automatically puts men above women both in the household, and in the community. Without political pull in the village, and with limited bargaining powers within the household, women lack the voice to advocate for their own rights.\n\nAnother issue with land rights in India is that they leave women completely dependent on the lives of their husbands. A study by Bina Agarwal found that in West Bengal, prosperous families turn destitute when the male head of the household dies, as women are not permitted to take over their husband’s land. Also, due to cultural tradition, the higher the status of the woman, the less likely she is to have any developed skills that would be useful in finding work. These women are forced to beg for food and shelter once their husbands die because they have not been allowed to gain work experience.\n\nBina Agarwal argues that land ownership significantly decreases the chance of domestic violence against Indian women. Owning property elevates women to a higher status within the household, allowing more equality and bargaining power. In addition, owning property separately from their husbands allowed women an opportunity of escape from abusive relationships. Agarwal concluded that the prospect of a safe shelter outside of the main household decreases the longevity of domestic violence.\n\nLand rights are critical for women in India due to the heavily patriarchal society in which they live. Cultural perspectives play a key role in the acceptance of equality within land ownership. Women owning land ultimately benefits the household and society as a whole.\n\nThe most recent advance towards equality in land rights in India was the Hindu Succession Act of 2005. This act aimed to remove the gender discrimination which was present in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. In the new amendment, daughters and sons have equal rights to obtain land from their parents. This act was both a legally and socially important move for women’s rights to land ownership. Not only did it legally mandate equality in land succession, it also validated women’s roles as equals in society.\n\nUganda’s 1995 Constitution enforces equality between men and women, including the acquisition and ownership of land. However, research from Women’s Land Link Africa reveals that women remain excluded from land ownership due to customs and deeply ingrained cultural habits. Even when women save up enough money to purchase land, the land is signed in their husband’s name, while women sign as the witness. Inheritance practices are a particular obstacle which reduces women empowerment, as well. Land is passed down through male lineage which reinforces women’s exclusion from land ownership. Another detriment to equality, pointed out by Women’s Land Link Africa, is that women lack sufficient knowledge about the rights they have under the law to own land. Rural, illiterate women do not even have access to the new constitution which guarantees them land rights.\n\nAlthough the 1995 Constitution provides for equality between men and women, there are still gaps in the law which affect women’s rights to land. The law protects the rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it does not address the needs of widows or divorcees. Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials. The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.\n\nWomen’s Land Link Africa provides suggestions to alleviate inequality in land ownership. Rural women can be educated about their rights through radio campaigns, community discussions, educational outreach programs, and public forums. The cultural nuances must be addressed in policies and community leaders can be educated about inclusion of minority groups. Also, the law itself can address the rights of widows and divorcees in addition to the rights of married women.\n\n"}
{"id": "17547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17547", "title": "Love", "text": "Love\n\nLove encompasses a variety of strong and positive emotional and mental states, ranging from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection and to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment. Love can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as \"the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another\". It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.\n\nLove in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.\n\nAncient Greek philosophers identified five forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, '), friendly love ('), romantic love (), guest love () and divine love (). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love. Asian cultures have also distinguished ', ', ', ', ', ', and other variants or symbioses of these states. Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning. This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.\n\nThe word \"love\" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Many other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that in English are denoted as \"love\"; one example is the plurality of Greek words for \"love\" which includes \"agape\" and \"eros\". Cultural differences in conceptualizing love thus doubly impede the establishment of a universal definition.\n\nAlthough the nature or essence of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what \"isn't\" love (antonyms of \"love\"). Love as a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of \"like\") is commonly contrasted with hate (or neutral apathy). As a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with lust. As an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with friendship, although the word \"love\" is often applied to close friendships or platonic love. (Further possible ambiguities come with usages \"girlfriend\", \"boyfriend\", \"just good friends\").\n\nThe complex and abstract nature of love often reduces discourse of love to a thought-terminating cliché. Several common proverbs regard love, from Virgil's \"Love conquers all\" to The Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\". St. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle, defines love as \"to will the good of another.\" Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of \"absolute value,\" as opposed to relative value. Philosopher Gottfried Leibniz said that love is \"to be delighted by the happiness of another.\" Meher Baba stated that in love there is a \"feeling of unity\" and an \"active appreciation of the intrinsic worth of the object of love.\" Biologist Jeremy Griffith defines love as \"unconditional selflessness\".\n\nPeople can be said to love an object, principle, or goal to which they are deeply committed and greatly value. For example, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' \"love\" of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love but impersonal love, altruism, and strong spiritual or political convictions. People can also \"love\" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, then this feeling is called paraphilia. A common principle that people say they love is life itself.\n\nInterpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a much more potent sentiment than a simple \"liking\" for a person. Unrequited love refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with interpersonal relationships. Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as erotomania.\n\nThroughout history, philosophy and religion have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the 20th century, the science of psychology has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, and biology have added to the understanding the concept of love.\n\nBiological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian drive, much like hunger or thirst. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security. Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.\n\nLust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating, and involves the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and estrogen. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in neuroscience have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the neurotransmitter hormones, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, the same compounds released by amphetamine, stimulating the brain's pleasure center and leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.\n\nSince the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. Attachment is the bonding that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as marriage and children, or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin to a greater degree than short-term relationships have. Enzo Emanuele and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.\n\nPsychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg formulated a triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic or platonic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three components. American psychologist Zick Rubin sought to define \"love\" by psychometrics in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.\n\nFollowing developments in electrical theories such as Coulomb's law, which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as \"opposites attract\". Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as immune systems, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds. In recent years, various human bonding theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.\nSome Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of Scott Peck, whose work in the field of applied psychology explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the \"concern for the spiritual growth of another,\" and simple narcissism. In combination, love is an \"activity\", not simply a feeling.\nPsychologist Erich Fromm maintained in his book \"The Art of Loving\" that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the \"feeling\" of love is superficial in comparison to one's commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time. In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration. Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.\n\nEvolutionary psychology has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore, researchers as early as Charles Darwin himself identified unique features of human love compared to other mammals and credit love as a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the development and expansion of the human species. Another factor may be that sexually transmitted diseases can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced fertility, injury to the fetus, and increase complications during childbirth. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.\n\nBiological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to hunger or thirst. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by hormones (such as oxytocin), neurotrophins (such as NGF), and pheromones, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in biology is that there are two major drives in love: sexual attraction and attachment. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of companionate love and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by physiological arousal (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.\n\nGreek distinguishes several different senses in which the word \"love\" is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or familiarity (in Greek, \"storge\"), friendship and/or platonic desire (\"philia\"), sexual and/or romantic desire (\"eros\"), and self-emptying or divine love (\"agape\"). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the Bible has examples of the verb \"agapo\" having the same meaning as \"phileo\".\n\n\"Agape\" ( \"agápē\") means \"love\" in modern-day Greek. The term \"s'agapo\" means \"I love you\" in Greek. The word \"agapo\" is the verb \"I love\". It generally refers to a \"pure,\" ideal type of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by \"eros\". However, there are some examples of \"agape\" used to mean the same as \"eros\". It has also been translated as \"love of the soul.\"\n\n\"Eros\" ( \"érōs\") (from the Greek deity Eros) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word \"erota\" means \"in love\". Plato refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as \"love of the body\".\n\n\"Philia\" ( \"philía\"), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics Book VIII. It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean \"love of the mind.\"\n\n\"Storge\" ( \"storgē\") is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.\n\n\"Xenia\" (ξενία \"xenía\"), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in ancient Greece. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout Greek mythology—in particular, Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\".\n\nThe Latin language has several different verbs corresponding to the English word \"love.\" \"amō\" is the basic verb meaning \"I love\", with the infinitive \"amare\" (“to love”) as it still is in Italian today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come \"amans\"—a lover, amator, \"professional lover,\" often with the accessory notion of lechery—and \"amica\", \"girlfriend\" in the English sense, often being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is \"amor\" (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, Rome—in Latin: \"Roma\"—can be viewed as an anagram for \"amor\", which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times), which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces \"amicus\"—\"friend\"—and \"amicitia\", \"friendship\" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to \"indebtedness\" or \"influence\"). Cicero wrote a treatise called \"On Friendship\" (\"de Amicitia\"), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called \"Ars Amatoria\" (\"The Art of Love\"), which addresses, in depth, everything from extramarital affairs to overprotective parents.\n\nLatin sometimes uses \"amāre\" where English would simply say \"to like\". This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by the terms \"placere\" or \"delectāre\", which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of Catullus. \"Diligere\" often has the notion \"to be affectionate for,\" \"to esteem,\" and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun \"diligentia\", however, has the meaning of \"diligence\" or \"carefulness,\" and has little semantic overlap with the verb. \"Observare\" is a synonym for \"diligere\"; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, \"observantia\", often denote \"esteem\" or \"affection.\" \"Caritas\" is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean \"charitable love\"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan Roman literature. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.\n\nTwo philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from Confucianism which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from Mohism which championed a universal love. A core concept to Confucianism is (\"Ren\", \"benevolent love\"), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself. In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.\n\nThe concept of (Mandarin: \"ài\") was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of \"universal love\" (, \"jiān'ài\"). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term \"Ai\" () was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, \"Ai\" was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.\n\nIn Mandarin Chinese, (\"ài\") is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. (\"ài\") is used as both a verb (e.g. , \"Wǒ ài nǐ\" , or \"I love you\") and a noun (such as \"àiqíng\", or \"romantic love\"). However, due to the influence of Confucian (\"rén\"), the phrase (\"Wǒ ài nǐ\", I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying \"I love you\" as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, \"I like you\" (, \"Wǒ xǐhuan nǐ\") is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious. This is also true in Japanese (\"suki da\", ).\n\nThe Japanese language uses three words to convey the English equivalent of \"love\". Because \"love\" covers a wide range of emotions and behavioral phenomena, there are nuances distinguishing the three terms. The term , which is often associated with maternal love or selfless love, originally referred to beauty and was often used in religious context. Following the Meiji Restoration 1868, the term became associated with \"love\" in order to translate Western literature. Prior to Western influence, the term generally represented romantic love, and was often the subject of the popular Man'yōshū Japanese poetry collection. \"Koi\" describes a longing for a member of the opposite sex and is typical interpreted as selfish and wanting. The term's origins come from the concept of lonely solitude as a result of separation from a loved one. Though modern usage of \"koi\" focuses on sexual love and infatuation, the Manyō used the term to cover a wider range of situations, including tenderness, benevolence, and material desire. The third term, , is a more modern construction that combines the kanji characters for both \"ai\" and \"koi\", though its usage more closely resembles that of \"koi\" in the form of romantic love.\n\nKama in Indian literature means “desire, wish or longing”. In contemporary literature, kama refers usually to sexual desire. However, the term also refers to any sensory enjoyment, emotional attraction and aesthetic pleasure such as from arts, dance, music, painting, sculpture and nature.\n\nThe concept kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in Vedas. For example, Book 10 of Rig Veda describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn 129, it states:\nRumi, Hafiz and Sa'di are icons of the passion and love that the Persian culture and language present. The Persian word for love is \"Ishq\", which is derived from Arabic language, however it is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for \"doost dashtan\" (\"liking\"). In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life.\n\nThe Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—\"eros\" in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (\"agape\"), are often contrasted as \"descending\" and \"ascending\" love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.\n\nThere are several Greek words for \"love\" that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.\n\nChristians believe that to \"Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength\" and \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" are the two most important things in life (the greatest commandment of the Jewish Torah, according to Jesus; cf. Gospel of Mark chapter 12, verses 28–34). Saint Augustine summarized this when he wrote \"Love God, and do as thou wilt.\"\n\nThe Apostle Paul glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poetic interpretation in 1 Corinthians, he wrote, \"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.\" (1 Cor. 13:4–7, NIV)\n\nThe Apostle John wrote, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\" (John 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, \"Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.\" (1 John 4:7–8, NIV)\n\nSaint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, “I was in love with love.” Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as \"jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.\" According to Saint Augustine, to love God is \"to attain the peace which is yours.\" (Saint Augustine's \"Confessions\")\n\nAugustine regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith and the interpretation of the Bible. After the review of Christian doctrine, Augustine treats the problem of love in terms of use and enjoyment until the end of Book I of \"De Doctrina Christiana\" (1.22.21-1.40.44;).\n\nChristian theologians see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian C.S. Lewis wrote a book called \"The Four Loves\". Benedict XVI named his first encyclical \"God is love\". He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others (agape) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and the Blessed Virgin Mary and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.\n\nPope Francis taught that \"True love is both loving and letting oneself be loved..what is important in love is not our loving, but allowing ourselves to be loved by God.\" And so, in the analysis of a Catholic theologian, for Pope Francis, \"the key to love...is not our activity. It is the activity of the greatest, and the source, of all the powers in the universe: God’s.\"\n\nIn Christianity the practical definition of love is summarised by St. Thomas Aquinas, who defined love as \"to will the good of another,\" or to desire for another to succeed. This is an explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies. As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.\n\nRegarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five:\n\n\"You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.\"\n- Matthew 5: 43-48\"\n\nTertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: \"Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies. To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians.\"\n\nIn Hebrew, (\"ahava\") is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. Chesed, often translated as loving-kindness, is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.\n\nThe commandment to love other people is given in the Torah, which states, \"Love your neighbor like yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love God \"with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might\" (Deuteronomy 6:5) is taken by the Mishnah (a central text of the Jewish oral law) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). Rabbinic literature differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: \"See life with the wife you love\" (Ecclesiastes 9:9). The biblical book Song of Solomon is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song. The 20th-century Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as \"giving without expecting to take\" (from his \"Michtav me-Eliyahu\", Vol. 1).\n\nLove encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God (Allah), there is the name \"Al-Wadud\", or \"the Loving One,\" which is found in Surah as well as Surah . God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as \"Ar-Rahman\" and \"Ar-Rahim\", or the \"Most Compassionate\" and the \"Most Merciful\", indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being \"full of loving kindness.\"\n\nThe Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with \"birr\" or \"deep kindness\" as stated in Surah . \"Birr\" is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.\n\n\"Ishq\", or divine love, is the emphasis of Sufism in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God \"looks\" at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being \"drunk\" due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.\n\nIn his Paris Talks, `Abdu'l-Bahá described four types of love: the love that flows from God to human beings; the love that flows from human beings to God; the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God; and the love of human beings for human beings.\n\nIn Buddhism, \"Kāma\" is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to enlightenment, since it is selfish. \"Karuṇā\" is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. \"Adveṣa\" and \"mettā\" are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.\n\nThe Bodhisattva ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.\n\nIn Hinduism, \"kāma\" is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god Kamadeva. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (\"Kama\") in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of sugar cane and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort Rati and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in Karnataka, India. \"Maara\" is another name for \"kāma\".\n\nIn contrast to \"kāma\", \"prema\"or \"prem\"refers to elevated love. \"Karuna\" is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. \"Bhakti\" is a Sanskrit term, meaning \"loving devotion to the supreme God.\" A person who practices \"bhakti\" is called a \"bhakta\". Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of \"bhakti\", which can be found in the \"Bhagavata Purana\" and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work \"Narada Bhakti Sutras\", written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love.\n\nIn certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unadulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)—two opposites .\n\nIn the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the \"Gita Govinda\" and \"Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.\"\n\nIn the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God \"(taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya)\", and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination \"(krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya)\". Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.\n\nThe term \"free love\" has been used to describe a social movement that rejects marriage, which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.\n\nMany people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to \"fulfill earthly human happiness.\" Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision of strongly defined gender roles, which provoked the advancement of the free love movement as a contrast.\n\nThe term \"sex radical\" has been used interchangeably with the term \"free lover\". By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases. These are also beliefs of Feminism.\n\nThe philosophy of love is a field of social philosophy and ethics that attempts to explain the nature of love. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love, asking if and how love is or can be justified, asking what the value of love is, and what impact love has on the autonomy of both the lover and the beloved.\n\nMany different theories attempt to explain the nature and function of love. Explaining love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved would be very difficult because to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love are: psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; evolutionary theories which hold that love is part of the process of natural selection; spiritual theories which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from a god; and theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.\n\n\n"}

Therefore, the fall in marginal utility as consumption increases is known as diminishing marginal utility. Mathematically:\n\nThe term \"marginal\" refers to a small change, starting from some baseline level. As Philip Wicksteed explained the term,\n\nMarginal considerations are considerations which concern a slight increase or diminution of the stock of anything which we possess or are considering\n\nFrequently the marginal change is assumed to start from the endowment, meaning the total resources available for consumption (see Budget constraint). This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made by the individual himself or herself and by others.\n\nFor reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in neoclassical analysis that goods and services are continuously divisible. Under this assumption, marginal concepts, including marginal utility, may be expressed in terms of differential calculus. Marginal utility can then be defined as the first derivative of total utility—the total satisfaction obtained from consumption of a good or service—with respect to the amount of consumption of that good or service.\n\nIn practice the smallest relevant division may be quite large. Sometimes economic analysis concerns the marginal values associated with a change of one unit of a discrete good or service, such as a motor vehicle or a haircut. For a motor vehicle, the total number of motor vehicles produced is large enough for a continuous assumption to be reasonable: this may not be true for, say, an aircraft carrier.\n\nDepending on which theory of \"utility\" is used, the interpretation of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility as if it were \"quantifiable\", that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.\n\nContemporary mainstream economic theory frequently defers metaphysical questions, and merely notes or assumes that preference structures conforming to certain rules can be usefully \"proxied\" by associating goods, services, or their uses with quantities, and \"defines\" \"utility\" as such a quantification.\n\nAnother conception is Benthamite philosophy, which equated usefulness with the production of pleasure and avoidance of pain, assumed subject to arithmetic operation. British economists, under the influence of this philosophy (especially by way of John Stuart Mill), viewed utility as \"the feelings of pleasure and pain\" and further as a \"\"quantity\" of feeling\" (emphasis added).\n\nThough generally pursued outside of the mainstream methods, there are conceptions of utility that do not rely on quantification.\nFor example, the Austrian school generally attributes value to \"the satisfaction of wants\", and sometimes rejects even the \"possibility\" of quantification.\nIt has been argued that the Austrian framework makes it possible to consider rational preferences that would otherwise be excluded.\n\nIn any standard framework, the same object may have different marginal utilities for different people, reflecting different preferences or individual circumstances.\n\nThe concept in cardinal utility theory that marginal utilities diminish across the ranges relevant to decision-making is called the \"law of diminishing marginal utility\" (and is also known as Gossen's First Law). This refers to the increase in utility an individual gains from increasing their consumption of a particular good. \"The law of diminishing marginal utility is at the heart of the explanation of numerous economic phenomena, including time preference and the value of goods ... The law says, first, that the marginal utility of each homogenous unit decreases as the supply of units increases (and vice versa); second, that the marginal utility of a larger-sized unit is greater than the marginal utility of a smaller-sized unit (and vice versa). The first law denotes the law of diminishing marginal utility, the second law denotes the law of increasing total utility.\"\n\nIn modern economics, choice under conditions of certainty at a single point in time is modeled via ordinal utility, in which the numbers assigned to the utility of a particular circumstance of the individual have no meaning by themselves, but which of two alternative circumstances has higher utility \"is\" meaningful. With ordinal utility, a person's preferences have no unique marginal utility, and thus whether or not marginal utility is diminishing is not meaningful. In contrast, the concept of diminishing marginal utility is meaningful in the context of cardinal utility, which in modern economics is used in analyzing intertemporal choice, choice under uncertainty, and social welfare.\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility is similar to the law of diminishing returns which states that as the amount of one factor of production increases as all other factors of production are held the same, the marginal return (extra output gained by adding an extra unit) decreases.\n\nAs the rate of commodity acquisition increases, \"marginal\" utility decreases. If commodity consumption continues to rise, marginal utility at some point may fall to zero, reaching maximum total utility. Further increase in consumption of units of commodities causes marginal utility to become negative; this signifies dissatisfaction. For example,\n\nDiminishing marginal utility is traditionally a microeconomic concept and often holds for an individual, although the marginal utility of a good or service might be \"increasing\" as well. For example:\n\nAs suggested elsewhere in this article, occasionally one may come across a situation in which marginal utility increases even at a macroeconomic level. For example, the provision of a service may only be viable if it accessible to most or all of the population, and the marginal utility of a raw material required to provide such a service will increase at the \"tipping point\" at which this occurs. This is similar to the position with very large items such as aircraft carriers: the numbers of these items involved are so small that marginal utility is no longer a helpful concept, as there is merely a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" decision.\n\nMarginalism explains choice with the hypothesis that people decide whether to effect any given change based on the marginal utility of that change, with rival alternatives being chosen based upon which has the greatest marginal utility.\n\nIf an individual possesses a good or service whose marginal utility to him is less than that of some other good or service for which he could trade it, then it is in his interest to effect that trade. Of course, as one thing is sold and another is bought, the respective marginal gains or losses from further trades will change. If the marginal utility of one thing is diminishing, and the other is not increasing, all else being equal, an individual will demand an increasing ratio of that which is acquired to that which is sacrificed. (One important way in which all else might not be equal is when the use of the one good or service complements that of the other. In such cases, exchange ratios might be constant.) If any trader can better his position by offering a trade more favorable to complementary traders, then he will do so.\n\nIn an economy with money, the marginal utility of a quantity is simply that of the best good or service that it could purchase. In this way it is useful for explaining supply and demand, as well as essential aspects of models of imperfect competition.\n\nThe \"paradox of water and diamonds\", usually most commonly associated with Adam Smith, though recognized by earlier thinkers, is the apparent contradiction that water possesses a value far lower than diamonds, even though water is far more vital to a human being.\n\nPrice is determined by both marginal utility and marginal cost, and here the key to the \"paradox\" is that the marginal cost of water is far lower than that of diamonds.\n\nThat is not to say that the price of any good or service is simply a function of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are willing to trade based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.\n\nUnder the special case in which usefulness can be quantified, the change in utility of moving from state formula_1 to state formula_2 is\nMoreover, if formula_1 and formula_2 are distinguishable by values of just one variable formula_6 which is itself quantified, then it becomes possible to speak of the ratio of the marginal utility of the change in formula_6 to the size of that change:\n\n(where “c.p.” indicates that the \"only\" independent variable to change is formula_6).\n\nMainstream neoclassical economics will typically assume that the limit\nexists, and use “marginal utility” to refer to the partial derivative\nAccordingly, diminishing marginal utility corresponds to the condition\n\nThe concept of marginal utility grew out of attempts by economists to explain the determination of price. The term “marginal utility”, credited to the Austrian economist Friedrich von Wieser by Alfred Marshall, was a translation of Wieser's term “Grenznutzen” (\"border-use\").\n\nPerhaps the essence of a notion of diminishing marginal utility can be found in Aristotle's \"Politics\", wherein he writes (There has been marked disagreement about the development and role of marginal considerations in Aristotle's value theory.)\n\nA great variety of economists have concluded that there is \"some\" sort of interrelationship between utility and rarity that affects economic decisions, and in turn informs the determination of prices. Diamonds are priced higher than water because their marginal utility is higher than water .\n\nEighteenth-century Italian mercantilists, such as Antonio Genovesi, Giammaria Ortes, Pietro Verri, Marchese Cesare di Beccaria, and Count Giovanni Rinaldo Carli, held that value was explained in terms of the general utility and of scarcity, though they did not typically work-out a theory of how these interacted. In \"Della moneta\" (1751), Abbé Ferdinando Galiani, a pupil of Genovesi, attempted to explain value as a ratio of two ratios, \"utility\" and \"scarcity\", with the latter component ratio being the ratio of quantity to use.\n\nAnne Robert Jacques Turgot, in \"Réflexions sur la formation et la distribution de richesse\" (1769), held that value derived from the general utility of the class to which a good belonged, from comparison of present and future wants, and from anticipated difficulties in procurement.\n\nLike the Italian mercantists, Étienne Bonnot, Abbé de Condillac, saw value as determined by utility associated with the class to which the good belong, and by estimated scarcity. In \"De commerce et le gouvernement\" (1776), Condillac emphasized that value is not based upon cost but that costs were paid because of value.\n\nThis last point was famously restated by the Nineteenth Century proto-marginalist, Richard Whately, who in \"Introductory Lectures on Political Economy\" (1832) wrote (Whatley's student Senior is noted below as an early marginalist.)\n\nThe first unambiguous published statement of any sort of theory of marginal utility was by Daniel Bernoulli, in “Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis”. This paper appeared in 1738, but a draft had been written in 1731 or in 1732. In 1728, Gabriel Cramer had produced fundamentally the same theory in a private letter. Each had sought to resolve the St. Petersburg paradox, and had concluded that the marginal desirability of money decreased as it was accumulated, more specifically such that the desirability of a sum were the natural logarithm (Bernoulli) or square root (Cramer) thereof. However, the more general implications of this hypothesis were not explicated, and the work fell into obscurity.\n\nIn “A Lecture on the Notion of Value as Distinguished Not Only from Utility, but also from Value in Exchange”, delivered in 1833 and included in \"Lectures on Population, Value, Poor Laws and Rent\" (1837), William Forster Lloyd explicitly offered a general marginal utility theory, but did not offer its derivation nor elaborate its implications. The importance of his statement seems to have been lost on everyone (including Lloyd) until the early 20th century, by which time others had independently developed and popularized the same insight.\n\nIn \"An Outline of the Science of Political Economy\" (1836), Nassau William Senior asserted that marginal utilities were the ultimate determinant of demand, yet apparently did not pursue implications, though some interpret his work as indeed doing just that.\n\nIn “De la mesure de l’utilité des travaux publics” (1844), Jules Dupuit applied a conception of marginal utility to the problem of determining bridge tolls.\n\nIn 1854, Hermann Heinrich Gossen published \"Die Entwicklung der Gesetze des menschlichen Verkehrs und der daraus fließenden Regeln für menschliches Handeln\", which presented a marginal utility theory and to a very large extent worked-out its implications for the behavior of a market economy. However, Gossen's work was not well received in the Germany of his time, most copies were destroyed unsold, and he was virtually forgotten until rediscovered after the so-called Marginal Revolution.\n\nMarginalism eventually found a foothold by way of the work of three economists, Jevons in England, Menger in Austria, and Walras in Switzerland.\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons first proposed the theory in “A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy” (PDF), a paper presented in 1862 and published in 1863, followed by a series of works culminating in his book \"The Theory of Political Economy\" in 1871 that established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time. Jevons' conception of utility was in the utilitarian tradition of Jeremy Bentham and of John Stuart Mill, but he differed from his classical predecessors in emphasizing that \"value depends entirely upon utility\", in particular, on \"final utility upon which the theory of Economics will be found to turn.\" He later qualified this in deriving the result that in a model of exchange equilibrium, price ratios would be proportional not only to ratios of \"final degrees of utility,\" but also to costs of production.\n\nCarl Menger presented the theory in \"Grundsätze der Volkswirtschaftslehre\" (translated as \"Principles of Economics\") in 1871. Menger's presentation is peculiarly notable on two points. First, he took special pains to explain \"why\" individuals should be expected to rank possible uses and then to use marginal utility to decide amongst trade-offs. (For this reason, Menger and his followers are sometimes called “the Psychological School”, though they are more frequently known as “the Austrian School” or as “the Vienna School”.) Second, while his illustrative examples present utility as quantified, his essential assumptions do not. (Menger in fact crossed-out the numerical tables in his own copy of the published \"Grundsätze\".) Menger also developed the law of diminishing marginal utility. Menger's work found a significant and appreciative audience.\n\nMarie-Esprit-Léon Walras introduced the theory in \"Éléments d'économie politique pure\", the first part of which was published in 1874 in a relatively mathematical exposition. Walras's work found relatively few readers at the time but was recognized and incorporated two decades later in the work of Pareto and Barone.\n\nAn American, John Bates Clark, is sometimes also mentioned. But, while Clark independently arrived at a marginal utility theory, he did little to advance it until it was clear that the followers of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were revolutionizing economics. Nonetheless, his contributions thereafter were profound.\n\nAlthough the Marginal Revolution flowed from the work of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, their work might have failed to enter the mainstream were it not for a second generation of economists. In England, the second generation were exemplified by Philip Henry Wicksteed, by William Smart, and by Alfred Marshall; in Austria by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and by Friedrich von Wieser; in Switzerland by Vilfredo Pareto; and in America by Herbert Joseph Davenport and by Frank A. Fetter.\n\nThere were significant, distinguishing features amongst the approaches of Jevons, Menger, and Walras, but the second generation did not maintain distinctions along national or linguistic lines. The work of von Wieser was heavily influenced by that of Walras. Wicksteed was heavily influenced by Menger. Fetter referred to himself and Davenport as part of “the American Psychological School”, named in imitation of the Austrian “Psychological School”. (And Clark's work from this period onward similarly shows heavy influence by Menger.) William Smart began as a conveyor of Austrian School theory to English-language readers, though he fell increasingly under the influence of Marshall.\n\nBöhm-Bawerk was perhaps the most able expositor of Menger's conception. He was further noted for producing a theory of interest and of profit in equilibrium based upon the interaction of diminishing marginal utility with diminishing marginal productivity of time and with time preference. (This theory was adopted in full and then further developed by Knut Wicksell and, with modifications including formal disregard for time-preference, by Wicksell's American rival Irving Fisher.)\n\nMarshall was the second-generation marginalist whose work on marginal utility came most to inform the mainstream of neoclassical economics, especially by way of his \"Principles of Economics\", the first volume of which was published in 1890. Marshall constructed the demand curve with the aid of assumptions that utility was quantified, and that the marginal utility of money was constant (or nearly so). Like Jevons, Marshall did not see an explanation for supply in the theory of marginal utility, so he synthesized an explanation of demand thus explained with supply explained in a more classical manner, determined by costs which were taken to be objectively determined. (Marshall later actively mischaracterized the criticism that these costs were themselves ultimately determined by marginal utilities.)\n\nKarl Marx acknowledged that \"nothing can have value, without being an object of utility\", but, in his analysis, \"use-value as such lies outside the sphere of investigation of political economy\", with labor being the principal determinant of value under capitalism.\n\nThe doctrines of marginalism and the Marginal Revolution are often interpreted as somehow a response to Marxist economics. However the first volume of \"Das Kapital\" was not published until July 1867, after the works of Jevons, Menger, and Walras were written or well under way (In 1874 Walras published Éléments d'économie politique pure and Carl Menger published Principles of Economics in 1871) ; and Marx was still a relatively minor figure when these works were completed. It is unlikely that any of them knew anything of him. (On the other hand, Hayek or Bartley has suggested that Marx, voraciously reading at the British Museum, may have come across the works of one or more of these figures, and that his inability to formulate a viable critique may account for his failure to complete any further volumes of \"Kapital\" before his death.)\n\nNonetheless, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the generation who followed the preceptors of the Revolution succeeded partly because they could formulate straightforward responses to Marxist economic theory. The most famous of these was that of Böhm-Bawerk, \"Zum Abschluss des Marxschen Systems\" (1896), but the first was Wicksteed's \"The Marxian Theory of Value. \"Das Kapital\": a criticism\" (1884, followed by \"The Jevonian criticism of Marx: a rejoinder\" in 1885). Initially there were only a few Marxist responses to marginalism, of which the most famous were Rudolf Hilferding's \"Böhm-Bawerks Marx-Kritik\" (1904) and \"Politicheskoy ekonomni rante\" (1914) by Никола́й Ива́нович Буха́рин (Nikolai Bukharin). However, over the course of the 20th century a considerable literature developed on the conflict between marginalism and the labour theory of value, with the work of the neo-Ricardian economist Piero Sraffa providing an important critique of marginalism.\n\nIt might also be noted that some followers of Henry George similarly consider marginalism and neoclassical economics a reaction to \"Progress and Poverty\", which was published in 1879.\n\nIn the 1980s John Roemer and other analytical Marxists have worked to rebuild Marxian theses on a marginalist foundation.\n\nIn his 1881 work \"Mathematical Psychics\", Francis Ysidro Edgeworth presented the indifference curve, deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services. Later work attempted to generalize to the indifference curve formulations of utility and marginal utility in avoiding unobservable measures of utility.\n\nIn 1915, Eugen Slutsky derived a theory of consumer choice solely from properties of indifference curves. Because of the World War, the Bolshevik Revolution, and his own subsequent loss of interest, Slutsky's work drew almost no notice, but similar work in 1934 by John Richard Hicks and R. G. D. Allen derived much the same results and found a significant audience. (Allen subsequently drew attention to Slutsky's earlier accomplishment.)\n\nAlthough some of the third generation of Austrian School economists had by 1911 rejected the quantification of utility while continuing to think in terms of marginal utility, most economists presumed that utility must be a sort of quantity. Indifference curve analysis seemed to represent a way to dispense with presumptions of quantification, albeit that a seemingly arbitrary assumption (admitted by Hicks to be a \"rabbit out of a hat\") about decreasing marginal rates of substitution would then have to be introduced to have convexity of indifference curves.\n\nFor those who accepted that indifference curve analysis superseded earlier marginal utility analysis, the latter became at best perhaps pedagogically useful, but \"old fashioned\" and observationally unnecessary.\n\nWhen Cramer and Bernoulli introduced the notion of diminishing marginal utility, it had been to address a paradox of gambling, rather than the paradox of value. The marginalists of the revolution, however, had been formally concerned with problems in which there was neither risk nor uncertainty. So too with the indifference curve analysis of Slutsky, Hicks, and Allen.\n\nThe expected utility hypothesis of Bernoulli and others was revived by various 20th century thinkers, with early contributions by Ramsey (1926), von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944), and Savage (1954). Although this hypothesis remains controversial, it brings not only utility, but a quantified conception of utility (cardinal utility), back into the mainstream of economic thought.\n\nA major reason why quantified models of utility are influential today is that risk and uncertainty have been recognized as central topics in contemporary economic theory. Quantified utility models simplify the analysis of risky decisions because, under quantified utility, diminishing marginal utility implies risk aversion. In fact, many contemporary analyses of saving and portfolio choice require stronger assumptions than diminishing marginal utility, such as the assumption of prudence, which means convex marginal utility.\n\nMeanwhile, the Austrian School continued to develop its ordinalist notions of marginal utility analysis, formally demonstrating that from them proceed the decreasing marginal rates of substitution of indifference curves.\n\n"}
{"id": "2320944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2320944", "title": "Martial race", "text": "Martial race\n\nMartial race was a designation created by army officials of British India after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where they classified each caste into one of two categories, 'martial' and 'non-martial'. The ostensible reason was that a 'martial race' was typically brave and well-built for fighting, while the 'non-martial races' were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their sedentary lifestyles. However, an alternative hypothesis is that British-trained Indian soldiers were among those who rebelled in 1857 and thereafter recruitment policy favoured castes which had remained loyal to the British and diminished or abandoned recruitment from the catchment area of the Bengal army. The concept already had a precedent in Indian culture as one of the four orders (varnas) in the Vedic social system of Hinduism is known as the Kshatriya, literally \"warriors.\"\n\nIn their attempts to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions with a history of conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that the qualities that make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, with the exception of the specified groups, did not have the requisite traits that would make them warriors.\n\nThe British recruited heavily from the 'martial races' for service in the colonial army. Sensing the inequalities and fierce loyalty to one's tribe or group of the diverse native peoples of the subcontinent, the British found opportunities to use it to their own great advantage. These already wide divides were a fertile breeding ground to inculcate pride in one's identity based on 'race'. This served the British in two ways. On the one hand it made sure that there was no repetition of the Indian rebellion of 1857 by ensuring there was no unity among the different subjects of the Raj. On the other hand, it encouraged a sense of competition among the different 'races'.\n\nBritish general and scholar Lieutenant-General Sir George MacMunn (1869–1952) noted in his writings \"It is only necessary for a feeling to arise that it is impious and disgraceful to serve the British, for the whole of our fabric to tumble like a house of cards without a shot being fired or a sword unsheathed\". To this end, it became British policy to recruit only from those tribes whom they classified as members of the 'martial races', and the practice became an integral part of the recruitment manuals for the Army in the British Raj. According to Jeffrey Greenhut, \"The Martial Race theory had an elegant symmetry. Indians who were intelligent and educated were defined as cowards, while those defined as brave were uneducated and backward.\"\n\nThe British regarded the 'martial races' as valiant and strong but also intellectually inferior, lacking the initiative or leadership qualities to command large military formations. They were also regarded as politically subservient or docile to authority. For these reasons, the martial races theory did not lead to officers being recruited from them; recruitment was based on social class and loyalty to the British Raj. One source calls this a \"pseudo-ethnological\" construction, which was popularised by Frederick Sleigh Roberts, and created serious deficiencies in troop levels during the World Wars, compelling them to recruit from 'non-martial races'. Winston Churchill was reportedly concerned that the theory was abandoned during the war and wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, India that he must, \"rely as much as possible on the martial races\". After Indian Independence, the Indian Army abandoned this theory and recruitment took place without discrimination.\n\nCritics of the theory state that the Indian rebellion of 1857 may have played a role in reinforcing the British belief in it. During this event the troops from the Bengal Native Infantry led by sepoy Mangal Pandey mutinied against the British. However, the loyal Pashtuns, Punjabis, Gurkhas, Kumaoni/Kumaunis and Garhwalis did not join the mutiny, and fought on the side of the British Army. From then on, this theory was used to the hilt to accelerate recruitment from among these 'races', whilst discouraging enlistment of 'disloyal' troops and high-caste Hindus who had sided with the rebel army during the war.\n\nSome authors, such as Heather Streets, argue that the military authorities puffed up the images of the martial soldiers by writing regimental histories, and by extolling the kilted Scots, kukri-wielding Gurkhas and turbaned Sikhs in numerous paintings. Richard Schultz, an American author, has claimed the martial race concept as a supposedly clever British effort to divide and rule the people of India for their own political ends.\n\nThe hillmen – Kumaonis, Garhwalis, Dogras and Gorkhas – were initially a great impediment to the establishment of the British Empire, but once they gave their loyalty to the British they helped them greatly in their administration and were thus given the status of martial race. Kumaonis had helped the British in their efforts against the Gurkhas in the Nepal War. When they were observed by the British to be fighting on both sides—the British as well as the Gorkha side—their valour was given recognition by the British and they were included in the British Army. The 3rd Gorkha Rifles was known as the Kumaon battalion when it was formed, and included Kumaonis and Garhwalis along with the Gorkhas. The Kumaonis, once accepted as a martial race, were themselves to be recruited in the Hyderabad regiment and displace the native troops, ultimately becoming the Kumaon Regiment after the independence of India.\n\nBritish-declared martial races in the Indian subcontinent included some groups that were officially designated instead as \"agricultural tribes\" under the provisions of the Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900. These terms were considered to be synonymous when the administration compiled a list in 1925. Among the communities listed as martial were:\n\n\n\nCommunities that were at various times classified as martial races include:\nThe recruitment of 'Madrassis' for infantry only took place during the Second World War when large numbers of troops were required to defend the British Empire in the form of a newly raised Madras Regiment. The Nairs of Kerala were initially included in the list, however after the Nairs of Travancore rebelled against the British under Velu Thampi Dalawa, they were recruited in lower numbers.\n\nThough seldom used in today's context, it has been alleged that Pakistan Military believed in the concept of martial races, and thought that they would easily defeat India in a war, especially prior to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Based on this belief in martial supremacy, it was popularly said that one Pakistani soldier was equal to four to ten Hindus or Indian soldiers, and thus numerical superiority of the foe could be overcome.\n\nThe Pakistan Army was also accused of bias and racism by the Bengalis of East Pakistan who felt humiliated by this dubious theory that was being floated in West Pakistan, that they were not 'martially inclined' compared to the Punjabis and Pashtuns. Pakistani author Hasan-Askari Rizvi notes that the limited recruitment of Bengali personnel in the Pakistan Army was because the West Pakistanis \"could not overcome the hangover of the martial race theory\".\n\nDefence writers in Pakistan have noted that the 1971 defeat was partially attributable to the flawed 'martial races' theory which led to wishful thinking that it was possible to defeat the Indian Army based on the theory alone. Author Stephen P. Cohen notes that \"Elevating the 'martial races' theory to the level of an absolute truth had domestic implications for Pakistani politics and contributed to the neglect of other aspects of security.\" Since then, the 'martial race' theory has rarely, if ever, been used by Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

Social class is the result of a person's function within society rather than merely the income of the household in which he or she resides. Both terms refer to people whose wealth or income is above the average, yet below the top. As opposed to households with above average incomes the mass affluent are also defined through liquid assets such as stocks, bonds, cash, and mutual funds. Fixed assets such as real estate are not commonly counted. This is because liquid assets provide more financial flexibility, which is a desirable trait in customers.\n\nThe mass affluent have been characterized as those who save more than they spend and invest for their future. While they worry about funding their children's college education, they realize other savings and loan options exist and they are not opposed to their children paying some part of their educational costs. The mass affluent generally may worry about replacing their paycheck in retirement, and may need to be encouraged to spend more money during their retirement years. They often wish to leave an inheritance to their children. The mass affluent will have between $500,000 and $1.5 million (USD) in investable assets upon retirement with a net worth between $500,000 and $2.5 million (USD). They spend between $4,000 and $10,000 (USD) per month in retirement.\n\nIn the United States there are roughly 33 million mass affluent households, and they own roughly 37% of America's liquid financial assets. Among family households, approximately thirty percent could be described as being mass affluent.\n\n\n"}

Other names for this phenomenon include Moral decay or Moral decline. The abruptness of such kind of degradation may vary depending on the situation and the events that take place within the given society over a certain time. Moral Breakdown may be caused by the changes in the political and/or cultural changes of the society, conflict or a natural disaster.\n\nA critical loss of moral or ethical values may take place during or past a major cataclysm which strikes a given society. One of the most known examples of moral breakdown originating from natural disasters took place during the epidemic of Black Death in Europe (1347–1350). The medieval society faced with the prospect of most certainly dying in a short time often chose to live its life to the fullest for as long as it could. Cases of heavy drinking, eating, adultery and other acts which were unethical/sinful to the contemporary Christian society took place. The people lost trust in the church and God since neither could provide a cure or safety from the pestilence.\n\nAccording to Catholic Herald (1969) during the war in Vietnam the multiple atrocities were committed on both sides of the conflict. Where as the news report reads violence neither reduces nor nulls violence, as well as the fact that violence breeds violence. Conflicts strongly increase the degradation of ethical values as in the instance of the massacre at pikville committed by the US army being silenced by the news of the first landing on the moon. In this particular instance one can see the Moral Breakdown caused by war not only within the ranks of the army, but also in the society.\n\nDuring major political or cultural changes such as the modern liberalism in Germany in the 1920s \n\nHistorians believe societal collapse and the overall disintegration of society from external or internal factors may exacerbate social discord and lead to a degradation of morality. Ancient Rome, for example, was notable for condoning infanticide and pedophilia almost from its foundation. A Roman father could legally abandon or kill his children at any age, for any reason. It was particularly common for Roman parents to abandon or kill baby girls. In addition, sexual exploitation of children was commonplace. It was possible to walk into almost any major Roman city and find brothels of child sex slaves for adults to exploit, castrated boys being a particularly-sought after delicacy. <ref>\n"}
{"id": "346349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346349", "title": "Multiple buffering", "text": "Multiple buffering\n\nIn computer science, multiple buffering is the use of more than one buffer to hold a block of data, so that a \"reader\" will see a complete (though perhaps old) version of the data, rather than a partially updated version of the data being created by a \"writer\". It also is used to avoid the need to use dual-ported RAM (DPRAM) when the readers and writers are different devices.\n\nAn easy way to explain how multiple buffering works is to take a real-world example. It is a nice sunny day and you have decided to get the paddling pool out, only you can not find your garden hose. You'll have to fill the pool with buckets. So you fill one bucket (or buffer) from the tap, turn the tap off, walk over to the pool, pour the water in, walk back to the tap to repeat the exercise. This is analogous to single buffering. The tap has to be turned off while you \"process\" the bucket of water.\n\nNow consider how you would do it if you had two buckets. You would fill the first bucket and then swap the second in under the running tap. You then have the length of time it takes for the second bucket to fill in order to empty the first into the paddling pool. When you return you can simply swap the buckets so that the first is now filling again, during which time you can empty the second into the pool. This can be repeated until the pool is full. It is clear to see that this technique will fill the pool far faster as there is much less time spent waiting, doing nothing, while buckets fill. This is analogous to double buffering. The tap can be on all the time and does not have to wait while the processing is done.\n\nIf you employed another person to carry a bucket to the pool while one is being filled and another emptied, then this would be analogous to triple buffering. If this step took long enough you could employ even more buckets, so that the tap is continuously running filling buckets.\n\nIn computer science the situation of having a running tap that cannot be, or should not be, turned off is common (such as a stream of audio). Also, computers typically prefer to deal with chunks of data rather than streams. In such situations, double buffering is often employed.\n\nThe Petri net in the illustration shows how double buffering works. Transitions W1 and W2 represent writing to buffer 1 and 2 respectively while R1 and R2 represent reading from buffer 1 and 2 respectively.\nAt the beginning only the transition W1 is enabled. After W1 fires, R1 and W2 are both enabled and can proceed in parallel. When they finish, R2 and W1 proceed in parallel and so on.\n\nSo after the initial transient where W1 fires alone, this system is periodic and the transitions are enabled – always in pairs (R1 with W2 and R2 with W1 respectively).\n\nIn computer graphics, double buffering is a technique for drawing graphics that shows no (or less) stutter, tearing, and other artifacts.\n\nIt is difficult for a program to draw a display so that pixels do not change more than once. For instance, when updating a page of text, it is much easier to clear the entire page and then draw the letters than to somehow erase all the pixels that are not in both the old and new letters. However, this intermediate image is seen by the user as flickering. In addition, computer monitors constantly redraw the visible video page (at around 60 times a second), so even a perfect update may be visible momentarily as a horizontal divider between the \"new\" image and the un-redrawn \"old\" image, known as tearing.\n\nA software implementation of double buffering has all drawing operations store their results in some region of system RAM; any such region is often called a \"back buffer\". When all drawing operations are considered complete, the whole region (or only the changed portion) is copied into the video RAM (the \"front buffer\"); this copying is usually synchronized with the monitor's raster beam in order to avoid tearing. Double buffering necessarily requires more memory and CPU time than single buffering because of the system memory allocated for the back buffer, the time for the copy operation, and the time waiting for synchronization.\n\nCompositing window managers often combine the \"copying\" operation with \"compositing\" used to position windows, transform them with scale or warping effects, and make portions transparent. Thus the \"front buffer\" may contain only the composite image seen on the screen, while there is a different \"back buffer\" for every window containing the non-composited image of the entire window contents.\n\nIn the page-flip method, instead of copying the data, both buffers are capable of being displayed (both are in VRAM). At any one time, one buffer is actively being displayed by the monitor, while the other, background buffer is being drawn. When the background buffer is complete, the roles of the two are switched. The page-flip is typically accomplished by modifying the value of a pointer to the beginning of the display data in the video memory.\n\nThe page-flip is much faster than copying the data and can guarantee that tearing will not be seen as long as the pages are switched over during the monitor's vertical blanking interval—the blank period when no video data is being drawn. The currently active and visible buffer is called the front buffer, while the background page is called the \"back buffer\".\n\nIn computer graphics, triple buffering is similar to double buffering but can provide improved performance. In double buffering, the program must wait until the finished drawing is copied or swapped before starting the next drawing. This waiting period could be several milliseconds during which neither buffer can be touched.\n\nIn triple buffering the program has two back buffers and can immediately start drawing in the one that is not involved in such copying. The third buffer, the front buffer, is read by the graphics card to display the image on the monitor. Once the image has been sent to the monitor, the front buffer is flipped with (or copied from) the back buffer holding the most recent complete image. Since one of the back buffers is always complete, the graphics card never has to wait for the software to complete. Consequently, the software and the graphics card are completely independent and can run at their own pace. Finally, the displayed image was started without waiting for synchronization and thus with minimum lag.\n\nDue to the software algorithm not having to poll the graphics hardware for monitor refresh events, the algorithm is free to run as fast as possible. This can mean that several drawings that are never displayed are written to the back buffers. Nvidia has implemented this method under the name \"Fast Sync\".\n\nAn alternative method sometimes referred to as triple buffering is a swap chain three buffers long. After the program has drawn both back buffers, it waits until the first one is placed on the screen, before drawing another back buffer (i.e. it is a 3-long first in, first out queue). Most Windows games seem to refer to this method when enabling triple buffering.\n\nThe term quad buffering means the use of double buffering for each of the left and right eye images in stereoscopic implementations, thus four buffers total (if triple buffering was used then there would be \"six\" buffers). The command to swap or copy the buffer typically applies to both pairs at once, so at no time does one eye see an older image than the other eye.\n\nQuad buffering requires special support in the graphics card drivers which is disabled for most consumer cards. AMD's Radeon HD 6000 Series and newer support it .\n\n3D standards like OpenGL and Direct3D support quad buffering.\n\nThe term double buffering is used for copying data between two buffers for direct memory access (DMA) transfers, \"not\" for enhancing performance, but to meet specific addressing requirements of a device (esp. 32-bit devices on systems with wider addressing provided via Physical Address Extension). Microsoft Windows device drivers are particularly noteworthy as a place where the term \"double buffering\" is likely to be used. Linux and BSD source code calls these \"bounce buffers\".\n\nDouble buffering is also used as a technique to facilitate interlacing or deinterlacing of video signals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294731", "title": "Musketeer", "text": "Musketeer\n\nA musketeer () was a type of soldier equipped with a musket. Musketeers were an important part of early modern armies, particularly in Europe, as they normally comprised the majority of their infantry. The musketeer was a precursor to the rifleman. Muskets were replaced by rifles in most western armies during the mid-1850s. The traditional designation of \"musketeer\" for an infantry private survived in the Imperial German Army until World War I.\n\nThe hand cannon, the firearm from which all others descended, was invented in China in the 12th century and was in widespread use there in the 13th century. It spread west across Asia in the 14th century. Arquebusiers and musketeers were utilized in the armies of the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties (1644–1911). In Zhao Shizhen's book of 1598 AD, the \"Shenqipu\", there were illustrations of Ottoman Turkish riflemen with detailed illustrations of their muskets, alongside European musketeers with detailed illustrations of their muskets. There was also an illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position in firing while favoring European-made muskets. The Chinese also built the first repeating fire-arm, several barrels behind a small wooden shield: the musketeer would turn the barrels and light each barrel with a slow match one by one. These weapons were most effective being fired from walls or high positions. Needham considered this weapon to be a \"primitive machine-gun\".\n\nThe famous Janissary corps of the Ottoman army were using matchlock muskets as early as the 1440s. The Ottoman Empire, centering on Turkey and extending into Arabia, used muskets to conquer Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and were one of the earliest users of muskets in a military conflict. It also utilized large cannons, the Great Turkish Bombard and incendiary devices. They are also probably the first to use muskets aboard ships.\n\nMuskets became an integral part of Indian warfare in the 1600s. They were used as an effective defense against war elephants. The Mughals, Marathas, Rajputs and Sikhs made use of musketeers, firing from cover, to ambush opposing infantry, cavalry and elephants. Many Indian gunsmiths existed during the 17th and 18th centuries, creating regular muskets and some combination weapons.\n\nIn the Spanish army, the \"Tercio\" or the \"Spanish Square\" was a mixed infantry formation that theoretically could have up to 3,000 pikemen, swordsmen and musketeers, although, on the battlefield, it was usually much smaller. It was nigh on invincible in its era, capitalizing on the brute strength and close-range abilities of the pikemen and the long-range projectile capabilities of the muskets. In practice, it appeared as a loosely formed phalanx in function, but was far more flexible and deadly. The musketeer manned tercios were developed from the earlier arquebusier manned \"coronelías\", which had firmly established their fearsome reputation by defeating the French and capturing their king at the Battle of Pavia in 1525.\n\nStreltsy () were the units of Russian guardsmen (sl. \"strelets\", стрелец. literally \"shooter\"; often translated as \"musketeer\", but more properly \"harquebuses\") from the 16th to the early 18th centuries, armed with firearms and halberds. They are also collectively known as \"Strelets Troops\" (Стрелецкое Войско).\n\nThe first streltsy units were created by Ivan the Terrible sometime between 1545 and 1550 and armed with the arquebus. They first saw combat at the Siege of Kazan in 1552. Military service in this unit became lifelong and hereditary. The bearded strelsty were organized into regiments, each with a long coat (\"kaftans\") and pointed cloth hat of a distinctive colour. By 1680, there were 20 regiments of Moscow streltsy totaling 20,048 men and comprising about 12 per cent of the total army (along with cossacks, militia and an increasing number of regular soldiers). In addition, there were significant numbers of frontier and garrison streltsy serving outside Moscow, although these were less formally drilled and equipped. \n\nThe Muscovite government was chronically short of cash so that the streltsy were often not paid well. While \"entitled\" to something like four rubles a year in the 1550s, they were often allowed to farm or trade in order to supplement their incomes. Textiles for clothing and foodstuffs were sometimes issued as part of their pay. A commander of one hundred musketeers (\"sotnik\") received up to 20 roubles a year and a regimental head (\"streletski golova\") between 30 and 60.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the Streltsy of Moscow began to actively participate in a struggle for power between different government groups, supporting the dissidents and showing hostility towards any foreign innovations.\n\nAfter the fall of Sophia Alekseyevna in 1689, the government of Peter the Great engaged in a process of gradual limitation of the streltsy’s military and political influence. In order to counter their power, Peter began to raise a new regular army, still armed with muskets but disciplined, uniformed and organised along West European lines. In spite of these measures, the streltsy revolted yet again while Peter was on his Great Embassy in Europe. The four regiments involved were disbanded and 1,200 of the mutineers were executed. The remainder were exiled, had their property confiscated and were banned from future military employment. The entire corps was technically abolished in 1689; however, after having suffered a defeat at Narva in 1700, the government retained some streltsy units in service.\n\nGradually, the streltsy were incorporated into the regular army. At the same time, they started to disband the Municipal Streltsy. Liquidation of the streltsy units was finally finished only in the 1720s, however, the Municipal Strel'tsy were kept in some cities until the late 18th century.\n\nThe Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky regiments of the Imperial Guard replaced the streltsy as the political and military force closest to the tsar.\n\nThe Musketeers of the Guard were a junior unit, initially of roughly company strength, of the military branch of the Royal Household or \"Maison du Roi\". They were created in 1622 when Louis XIII furnished a company of light cavalry (the \"carabiniers\", created by Louis' father Henry IV) with muskets. Musketeers fought in battle both on foot as infantry and on horseback as dragoons. At the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 the King's Musketeers served as regular cavalry, charging British infantry with drawn swords.\n\nAs one of the junior units in the Royal Guard, the Musketeers were not closely linked to the royal family. Traditional bodyguard duties were in fact performed by the Garde du Corps and the Cent-suisses. Because of its later establishment, the Musketeers were open to the lower classes of French nobility or younger sons from noble families whose oldest sons served in the more prestigious Garde du Corps and Chevau-legers (Light Horse). The Musketeers soon gained a reputation for boisterousness and fighting spirit because the only way for social and career advancement was excelling at their task as mounted light dragoons.\n\nTheir high esprit de corps gained royal favor for the Musketeers and they were frequently seen at court and in Paris. Shortly after their creation, Cardinal Richelieu created a bodyguard unit for himself. So as not to offend the King with a perceived sense of self-importance, Richelieu did not name them Garde du Corps like the King's personal guards but rather Musketeers after the Kings' junior guard cavalry. This was the start of a bitter rivalry between the two corps of Musketeers. At the cardinal's death in 1642, the company passed to his successor Cardinal Mazarin. At Mazarin's death in 1661, the cardinal's Musketeers passed to Louis XIV to the disgust of both the King's Musketeers and the Cardinal's Musketeers. The Musketeers were subsequently reorganized as a guard cavalry regiment of two companies. The King's Musketeers became the first company, popularly known as \"Grey Musketeers\" (\"mousquetaires gris\"), while the Cardinal's Musketeers became the second company, known as \"Black Musketeers\" (\"mousquetaires noirs\") for riding grey and black horses, respectively. From their establishment, the Musketeers wore blue cloak-like cassocks, lined with red and edged with silver embroidery. From 1688, the cassocks were replaced by smaller \"soubrevestes\" or sleeveless coats in the same colours. In the early decades of the corps, the musketeers had worn civilian dress under their cassocks, according to personal taste and means, but in 1677 a scarlet uniform was adopted.\n\nIn terms of recruitment, the Musketeers were among the most sought after of the military companies of the \"Ancien Régime\". This was due to the lower entrance requirements. The senior guard units were in effect closed to all but the most senior and wealthy of French nobles, so for the majority of French nobles (many of whom lived in genteel poverty), service in the Musketeers was the only way to join a mounted unit in the Royal Household and perhaps catch the King's eye. However, enlistment did require both letters of recommendation and evidence that a recruit had the family means to support the costs of service. These included the provision of horses, swords, clothing, a servant and equipment. Only the muskets and the distinctive blue cassock were provided by the monarch.\n\nIn 1776, the Musketeers were disbanded by Louis XVI, for budgetary reasons. Following the first Bourbon Restoration, the Musketeers were reestablished on 6 July 1814 along with the other military units of the former Royal Household. These expensive and aristocratic regiments proved ineffective when Napoleon returned from Elba, mostly dispersing though some accompanied Louis XVIII into brief exile. Following the second restoration of the Monarchy, the Musketeers were finally disbanded on 1 January 1816.\n\nDecades later, starting in 1844, this group was the subject of the now-famous serial publication \"The Three Musketeers\", in the magazine \"Le Siècle\" between March and July 1844. The author, Alexandre Dumas, père, based his work on the book \"Mémoires de Monsieur d'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la première compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi\" (Memoirs of Mister d'Artagnan, lieutenant captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700).\n\nThanks to the reforms of Gustav II Adolf, the Swedish Army brought to maturity the new style of fighting that made Sweden into a great power in the 17th century. This style of fighting became the new standard throughout Europe and its colonies in the latter stages of musket dominated warfare. Manuals based on Gustav's own revolutionised the training and tactics of western armies.\n\nThe iconic \"Redcoat\" of the British Empire was the staple unit in the British armies that created the largest empire in history. The British infantryman was equipped with the .75 calibre Land Pattern Musket, or Brown Bess. He was well trained by the standards of the time, training with live ammunition. A fully trained redcoat could fire four times a minute. This, combined with the technique of firing by companies (a method wherein blocks of men fired smaller volleys in succession, creating a wave of fire down the front of the regiment), made it possible for the British musketeer to win pitched battles against superior numbers.\n\nThe musket was withdrawn from service with the British Army in 1854, replaced by the muzzle-loading Minié rifle, which had an accurate range of over three times that of the Brown Bess which it replaced.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "454151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454151", "title": "Negative liberty", "text": "Negative liberty\n\nNegative liberty is freedom from interference by other people. Negative liberty is primarily concerned with freedom from external restraint and contrasts with positive liberty (the possession of the power and resources to fulfil one's own potential). The distinction was introduced by Isaiah Berlin in his 1958 lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\".\n\n\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" describes negative liberty:\n\"The negative concept of freedom ... is most commonly assumed in liberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences of the right to private property, although some have contested the claim that private property necessarily enhances negative liberty.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas Hobbes, \"a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and will he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do\" (\"Leviathan\", Part 2, Ch. XXI; thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).\n\nClaude Adrien Helvétius expressed the following point clearly: \"The free man is the man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a slave by the fear of punishment ... it is not lack of freedom, not to fly like an eagle or swim like a whale.\" Moreover, John Jay, in \"The Federalist\" paper No. 2, stated that: \"Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers.\" Jay's meaning would be better expressed by substituting \"negative liberty\" in place of \"natural rights\", for the argument here is that the power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.\n\nAn idea that anticipates the distinction between negative and positive liberty was G. F. W. Hegel's \"sphere of abstract right\" (furthered in his \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right\"), which constitutes what now is called negative freedom and his subsequent distinction between \"abstract\" and \"positive liberty.\" \n\nIn the Anglophone analytic tradition the distinction between negative and positive liberty was introduced by Isaiah Berlin in his 1958 lecture \"Two Concepts of Liberty\". According to Berlin, the distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition. In Berlin's words, \"liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'.\" Restrictions on negative liberty are imposed by a person, not by natural causes or incapacity.\n\nFrankfurt School psychoanalyst and humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work, \"The Fear of Freedom\", that predates Berlin's essay by more than a decade. Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, \"is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions.\" For Fromm, then, negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct.\n\nThe distinction between positive and negative liberty is considered specious by some socialist and Marxist political philosophers, who argue that positive and negative liberty are indistinguishable in practice, or that one cannot exist without the other. Although he is not a socialist nor a Marxist, Berlin argues: \"It follows that a frontier must be drawn between the area of private life and that of public authority. Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others.\"\n\nLibertarian thinker Tibor Machan defends negative liberty as \"required for moral choice and, thus, for human flourishing,\" claiming that it \"is secured when the rights of individual members of a human community to life, to voluntary action (or to liberty of conduct), and to property are universally respected, observed, and defended.\"\n\nOne might ask, \"How is men's desire for liberty to be reconciled with the assumed need for authority?\" Its answer by various thinkers provides a fault line for understanding their view on liberty but also a cluster of intersecting concepts such as authority, equality, and justice.\n\nHobbes and Locke give two influential and representative solutions to this question. As a starting point, both agree that a line must be drawn and a space sharply delineated where each individual can act unhindered according to their tastes, desires, and inclinations. This zone defines the sacrosanct space of personal liberty. But, they believe no society is possible without some authority, where the intended purpose of authority is to prevent collisions among the different ends and, thereby, to demarcate the boundaries where each person's zone of liberty begins and ends. Where Hobbes and Locke differ is the extent of the zone. Hobbes, who took a rather negative view of human nature, argued that a strong authority was needed to curb men's intrinsically wild, savage, and corrupt impulses. Only a powerful authority can keep at bay the permanent and always looming threat of anarchy. Locke believed, on the other hand, that men on the whole are more good than wicked and, accordingly, the area for individual liberty can be left rather at large.\n\nLocke is a slightly more ambiguous case than Hobbes because although his conception of liberty was largely negative (in terms of non-interference), he differed in that he courted the republican tradition of liberty by rejecting the notion that an individual could be free if he was under the arbitrary power of another:\n\n\"This \"freedom\" from absolute, arbitrary power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a man's preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his preservation and life together: for a man, not having the power of his own life, cannot, by compact, or his own consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the absolute, arbitrary power of another, to take away his life, when he pleases. No body can give more power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own life, cannot give another power over it. Indeed, having by his fault forfeited his own life, by some act that deserves death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in his power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service, and he does him no injury by it: for, whenever he finds the hardship of his slavery outweigh the value of his life, it is in his power, by resisting the will of his master, to draw on himself the death he desires.\"\n\nThis section outlines specific examples of governmental types which follow the concept of negative liberty.\n\nThomas Hobbes' \"Leviathan\" outlines a commonwealth based upon a monarchy to whom citizens have ceded their rights. The basic reasoning for Hobbes' assertion that this system was most ideal relates more to Hobbes' value of order and simplicity in government. The monarchy provides for its subjects, and its subjects go about their day-to-day lives without interaction with the government:\nThe commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: \"I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.\"\n\nThe sovereign has twelve principal rights:\n\n\nHobbes explicitly rejects the idea of \"Separation of Powers\", in particular the form that would later become the separation of powers under the United States Constitution. Part 6 is a perhaps under-emphasised feature of Hobbes's argument: his is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech, should they be considered desirable by the sovereign in order to promote order.\nUpon closer inspection of Hobbes' \"Leviathan\", it becomes clear that Hobbes believed individual people in society must give up liberty to a sovereign. Whether that sovereign is an absolute monarch or other form was left open to debate, however Hobbes himself viewed the absolute monarch as the best of all options. Hobbes himself said,\n\nFor as amongst masterless men, there is perpetual war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of goods, or lands; no security; but a full and absolute liberty in every particular man: so in states, and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth, not every man, has an absolute liberty, to do what it shall judge, that is to say, what that man, or assembly that representeth it, shall judge most conducing to their benefit.\n\nFrom this quote it is clear that Hobbes contended that people in a state of nature ceded their individual rights to create sovereignty, retained by the state, in return for their protection and a more functional society. In essence, a social contract between the sovereign and citizens evolves out of pragmatic self-interest. Hobbes named the state \"Leviathan\", thus pointing to the artifice involved in the social contract. In this vein, Hobbes' concept of negative liberty was built upon the notion that the state would not act upon its subjects because its subjects had willingly relinquished their liberties.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "596816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=596816", "title": "Particle-in-cell", "text": "Particle-in-cell\n\nThe particle-in-cell (PIC) method refers to a technique used to solve a certain class of partial differential equations. In this method, individual particles (or fluid elements) in a Lagrangian frame are tracked in continuous phase space, whereas moments of the distribution such as densities and currents are computed simultaneously on Eulerian (stationary) mesh points.\n\nPIC methods were already in use as early as 1955,\neven before the first Fortran compilers were available. The method gained popularity for plasma simulation in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others. In plasma physics applications, the method amounts to following the trajectories of charged particles in self-consistent electromagnetic (or electrostatic) fields computed on a fixed mesh. \n\nFor many types of problems, the classical PIC method invented by Buneman, Dawson, Hockney, Birdsall, Morse and others is relatively intuitive and straightforward to implement. This probably accounts for much of its success, particularly for plasma simulation, for which the method typically includes the following procedures:\n\nModels which include interactions of particles only through the average fields are called PM (particle-mesh). Those which include direct binary interactions are PP (particle-particle). Models with both types of interactions are called PP-PM or PM.\n\nSince the early days, it has been recognized that the PIC method is susceptible to error from so-called \"discrete particle noise\".\n\nThis error is statistical in nature, and today it remains less-well understood than for traditional fixed-grid methods, such as Eulerian or semi-Lagrangian schemes.\n\nModern geometric PIC algorithms are based on a very different theoretical framework. These algorithms use tools of discrete manifold, interpolating differential forms, and canonical or non-canonical symplectic integrators to guarantee gauge invariant and conservation of charge, energy-momentum, and more importantly the infinitely dimensional symplectic structure of the particle-field system.\nThese desired features are attributed to the fact that geometric PIC algorithms are built on the more fundamental field-theoretical framework and are directly linked to the perfect form, i.e., the variational principle of physics.\n\nInside the plasma research community, systems of different species (electrons, ions, neutrals, molecules, dust particles, etc.) are investigated. The set of equations associated with PIC codes are therefore the Lorentz force as the equation of motion, solved in the so-called \"pusher\" or \"particle mover\" of the code, and Maxwell's equations determining the electric and magnetic fields, calculated in the \"(field) solver\".\n\nThe real systems studied are often extremely large in terms of the number of particles they contain. In order to make simulations efficient or at all possible, so-called \"super-particles\" are used. A super-particle (or \"macroparticle\") is a computational particle that represents many real particles; it may be millions of electrons or ions in the case of a plasma simulation, or, for instance, a vortex element in a fluid simulation. It is allowed to rescale the number of particles, because the Lorentz force depends only on the charge-to-mass ratio, so a super-particle will follow the same trajectory as a real particle would.\n\nThe number of real particles corresponding to a super-particle must be chosen such that sufficient statistics can be collected on the particle motion. If there is a significant difference between the density of different species in the system (between ions and neutrals, for instance), separate real to super-particle ratios can be used for them.\n\nEven with super-particles, the number of simulated particles is usually very large (> 10), and often the particle mover is the most time consuming part of PIC, since it has to be done for each particle separately. Thus, the pusher is required to be of high accuracy and speed and much effort is spent on optimizing the different schemes.\n\nThe schemes used for the particle mover can be split into two categories, implicit and explicit solvers. While implicit solvers(e.g. implicit Euler scheme) calculate the particle velocity from the already updated fields, explicit solvers use only the old force from the previous time step, and are therefore simpler and faster, but require a smaller time step. Two frequently used schemes are the leapfrog method, and the \"Boris scheme\", \n\nFor plasma applications, the leapfrog method takes the following form:\n\nwhere the subscript formula_3 refers to \"old\" quantities from the previous time step, formula_4 to updated quantities from the next time step (i.e. formula_5), and velocities are calculated in-between the usual time steps formula_6.\n\nIn comparison, the equations of the Boris scheme are:\n\nwith \nand formula_13.\n\nBecause of its excellent long term accuracy, the Boris algorithm is the de facto standard for advancing a charged particle. It was realized that the excellent long term accuracy of nonrelativistic Boris algorithm is due to the fact it conserves phase space volume, even though it is not symplectic. The global bound on energy error typically associated with symplectic algorithms still holds for the Boris algorithm, making it an effective algorithm for the multi-scale dynamics of plasmas. It has also been shown\n\nthat one can improve on the relativistic Boris push to make it both volume preserving and have a constant-velocity solution in crossed E and B fields.\n\nThe most commonly used methods for solving Maxwell's equations (or more generally, partial differential equations (PDE)) belong to one of the following three categories:\n\nWith the FDM, the continuous domain is replaced with a discrete grid of points, on which the electric and magnetic fields are calculated. Derivatives are then approximated with differences between neighboring grid-point values and thus PDEs are turned into algebraic equations.\n\nUsing FEM, the continuous domain is divided into a discrete mesh of elements. The PDEs are treated as an eigenvalue problem and initially a trial solution is calculated using basis functions that are localized in each element. The final solution is then obtained by optimization until the required accuracy is reached.\n\nAlso spectral methods, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), transform the PDEs into an eigenvalue problem, but this time the basis functions are high order and defined globally over the whole domain. The domain itself is not discretized in this case, it remains continuous. Again, a trial solution is found by inserting the basis functions into the eigenvalue equation and then optimized to determine the best values of the initial trial parameters.\n\nThe name \"particle-in-cell\" originates in the way that plasma macro-quantities (number density, current density, etc.) are assigned to simulation particles (i.e., the \"particle weighting\"). Particles can be situated anywhere on the continuous domain, but macro-quantities are calculated only on the mesh points, just as the fields are. To obtain the macro-quantities, one assumes that the particles have a given \"shape\" determined by the shape function\n\nwhere formula_15 is the coordinate of the particle and formula_16 the observation point. Perhaps the easiest and most used choice for the shape function is the so-called \"cloud-in-cell\" (CIC) scheme, which is a first order (linear) weighting scheme. Whatever the scheme is, the shape function has to satisfy the following conditions:\n\nspace isotropy, charge conservation, and increasing accuracy (convergence) for higher-order terms.\n\nThe fields obtained from the field solver are determined only on the grid points and can't be used directly in the particle mover to calculate the force acting on particles, but have to be interpolated via the \"field weighting\":\n\nwhere the subscript formula_18 labels the grid point. To ensure that the forces acting on particles are self-consistently obtained, the way of calculating macro-quantities from particle positions on the grid points and interpolating fields from grid points to particle positions has to be consistent, too, since they both appear in Maxwell's equations. Above all, the field interpolation scheme should conserve momentum. This can be achieved by choosing the same weighting scheme for particles and fields and by ensuring the appropriate space symmetry (i.e. no self-force and fulfilling the action-reaction law) of the field solver at the same time\n\nAs the field solver is required to be free of self-forces, inside a cell the field generated by a particle must decrease with decreasing distance from the particle, and hence inter-particle forces inside the cells are underestimated. This can be balanced with the aid of Coulomb collisions between charged particles. Simulating the interaction for every pair of a big system would be computationally too expensive, so several Monte Carlo methods have been developed instead. A widely used method is the \"binary collision model\", in which particles are grouped according to their cell, then these particles are paired randomly, and finally the pairs are collided.\n\nIn a real plasma, many other reactions may play a role, ranging from elastic collisions, such as collisions between charged and neutral particles, over inelastic collisions, such as electron-neutral ionization collision, to chemical reactions; each of them requiring separate treatment. Most of the collision models handling charged-neutral collisions use either the \"direct Monte-Carlo\" scheme, in which all particles carry information about their collision probability, or the \"null-collision\" scheme, which does not analyze all particles but uses the maximum collision probability for each charged species instead.\n\nAs in every simulation method, also in PIC, the time step and the grid size must be well chosen, so that the time and length scale phenomena of interest are properly resolved in the problem. In addition, time step and grid size affect the speed and accuracy of the code.\n\nFor an electrostatic plasma simulation using an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leapfrog, which is most commonly used), two important conditions regarding the grid size formula_19 and the time step formula_20 should be fulfilled in order to ensure the stability of the solution:\n\nwhich can be derived considering the harmonic oscillations of a one-dimensional unmagnetized plasma. The latter conditions is strictly required but practical considerations related to energy conservation suggest to use a much stricter constraint where the factor 2 is replaced by a number one order of magnitude smaller. The use of formula_23 is typical. Not surprisingly, the natural time scale in the plasma is given by the inverse plasma frequency formula_24 and length scale by the Debye length formula_25.\n\nFor an explicit electromagnetic plasma simulation, the time step must also satisfy the CFL condition:\nwhere formula_27, and formula_28 is the speed of light.\n\nWithin plasma physics, PIC simulation has been used successfully to study laser-plasma interactions, electron acceleration and ion heating in the auroral ionosphere, magnetohydrodynamics, magnetic reconnection, as well as ion-temperature-gradient and other microinstabilities in tokamaks, furthermore vacuum discharges, and dusty plasmas.\n\nHybrid models may use the PIC method for the kinetic treatment of some species, while other species (that are Maxwellian) are simulated with a fluid model.\n\nPIC simulations have also been applied outside of plasma physics to problems in solid and fluid mechanics.\n\n\n"}

The Greek (\"pilidion\") and Latin \"pilleolus\" were smaller versions, similar to a skullcap.\n\nThe pilos (Greek: πῖλος, \"felt\") was a common conical travelling hat in Illyria and Ancient Greece. The pilos is the brimless version of the \"petasos\". It could be made of felt or leather. Pilos caps often identify the mythical twins, or Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, as represented in sculptures, bas-reliefs and on ancient ceramics. Their caps were supposedly the remnants of the egg from which they hatched. The pilos appears on votive figurines of boys at the sanctuary of the Cabeiri at Thebes, the \"Cabeirion\".\n\nIn warfare, the pilos type helmet was often worn by the peltast light infantry, in conjunction with the exomis, but it was also worn by the heavy infantry.\n\nThe pilos helmet was made of bronze in the same shape as the pilos which was presumably sometimes worn under the helmet for comfort, giving rise to the helmet's conical shape. The first widespread adoption of the pilos helmet occurred in Sparta towards the end of the 5th century BC.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, a slave was freed in a ceremony in which a praetor touched the slave with a rod called a \"vindicta\" and pronounced him to be free. The slave's head was shaved and a pileus was placed upon it. Both the \"vindicta\" and the cap were considered symbols of Libertas, the goddess representing liberty. This was a form of extra-legal manumission (the \"manumissio minus justa\") considered less legally sound than manumission in a court of law.\n\nOne 19th century dictionary of classical antiquity states that, \"Among the Romans the cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When a slave obtained his freedom he had his head shaved, and wore instead of his hair an undyed pileus.\" Hence the phrase \"servos ad pileum vocare\" is a summons to liberty, by which slaves were frequently called upon to take up arms with a promise of liberty (Liv. XXIV.32). The figure of Liberty on some of the coins of Antoninus Pius, struck A.D. 145, holds this cap in the right hand.\n\nJewish priests wore a \"pilos\" (conical cap), mentioned in Exodus .\n\n\n\n"}

The WHO defines the practice as \"all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\"\n\nIn a 2013 UNICEF report covering 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East, Ethiopia had the region's highest total number of women that have undergone FGM (27.2 million), while Somalia had the highest percentage (prevalence) of FGM (98%).\n\nThe world's first known campaign against FGM took place in Egypt in the 1920s. FGM prevalence in Egypt in 1995 was still at least as high as Somalia's 2013 world record (98%), despite dropping significantly since then among young women. Estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary according to source.\n\nThe WHO identifies four types of FGM:\n\nThe term \"prevalence\" is used to describe the proportion of women and girls now living in a country who have undergone FGM at some stage in their lives. This is distinct from the \"incidence\" of FGM which describes the proportion of women and girls who have undergone the procedure within a particular time period, which could be contemporary or historical. FGM is practiced in Africa, the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as some migrants in Europe, United States and Australia. It is also seen in some populations of South Asia. The highest known prevalence rates are in 30 African countries, in a band that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to Ethiopia on the east coast, as well as from Egypt in the north to Tanzania in the south.\n\nIn a 2013 UNICEF report based on surveys completed by select countries, FGM is known to be prevalent in 27 African countries, Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan, where 125 million women and girls have undergone FGM. The UNICEF report notes FGM is found in countries beyond the 29 countries it covered, and the total worldwide number is unknown. \n\nOther reports claim the prevalence of FGM in countries not discussed by the 2013 UNICEF report. The practice occurs in Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Earlier reports claimed the prevalence of FGM in Israel among the Negev Bedouin, which by 2009 has virtually disappeared.\n\nAs a result of immigration, FGM has also spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States, with some families having their daughters undergo the procedure while on vacation overseas. As Western governments become more aware of FGM, legislation has come into effect in many countries to make the practice a criminal offense. In 2006, Khalid Adem became the first man in the United States to be prosecuted for mutilating his daughter.\n\nThe United Nations has called for elimination of the practice by 2030. A 2017 UCLA Fielding School of Public Health study, measuring trends in the prevalence of FGM over the course of three decades, found that they dropped significantly in 17 of the 22 countries surveyed. The researchers found a 2–8 percentage points increase in Chad, Mali and Sierra Leone during the 30-years period.\n\nMuch of the FGM prevalence data currently available is based on verbal surveys and self-reporting. Clinical examinations are uncommon. The assumption is that women respond truthfully when asked about their FGM status and that they know the type and extent of FGM that was performed on their genitalia. Many FGM procedures are performed at a very young age, many cultures feel a taboo about such discussions, and a number of such factors raise the possibility that the validity of survey responses might be incorrect, potentially underreported. In Oman, for example, some do not wish to discuss FGM from the fear that such discussion is showing their culture's dirty laundry to the world, causing criticism of a practice that they believe is purely religious.\n\nIn countries where FGM has been outlawed, fear of prosecution of family members or self, and social disapproval from elders may cause women to deny that they underwent or were subjected to FGM. For example, the self-reported circumcision status of women aged 15–49 was verbally surveyed in 1995 in northern Ghana. The same women were interviewed again in 2000 after the enactment of a law that criminalized FGM and Ghana-wide public campaigns against the practice. This study discovered that 13% of women who reported in 1995 that they had undergone FGM denied it in the 2000 interview, with youngest age group girls denying at rates as high as 50%.\n\nUNICEF has revised its data on the FGM prevalence rates in the Kurdistan region of the Middle East:\n\nIn July 2003, at its second summit, the African Union adopted the Maputo Protocol promoting women's rights and calling for an end to FGM. The agreement came into force in November 2005, and by December 2008, 25 member countries had ratified it.\n\nAs of 2013, according to a UNICEF report, 24 African countries have legislations or decrees against FGM/C practice; these countries are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria (since 2015), Senegal, Somalia, Sudan (some states), Tanzania, Togo and Uganda (see page 9 of the report) and Zambia and South Africa (see page 8). In 2015, Gambia's president Yahya Jammeh \nhas banned FGM.\n\nIn 2014 The Girl Generation, an Africa-led campaign to oppose FGM worldwide, was launched.\n\nAlthough estimates of the prevalence of FGM vary, sources have consistently found the practice to be undergone by the majority of women in the Horn of Africa, in the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali and Burkina Faso, as well as in Sudan and Egypt.\nOf these countries, all have laws or decrees against the practice, with the exception of Sierra Leone, Mali and some states of Sudan.\n\nInfibulation, the most extreme form of FGM, known also as Type III, is practiced primarily in countries located in northeastern Africa.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in South Algeria among Sub-Saharan African migrants, but is considered a criminal offense and is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Benin. According to a 2011-12 survey, 7.3% of the women in Benin have been subjected to FGM. This is a decline over the 2001 survey, which reported 17%. The prevalence varies with religion in Benin; FGM is prevalent in 49% of Muslim women. The prevalence in other groups is lower, 3% of traditional religions, 3% of Roman Catholic and 1% in other Christian women. A 2003 law bans all forms of FGM. According to UNICEF, Benin experienced the most dramatic decline in low prevalence countries, from 8% in 2006 to 2% in 2012, a 75% decline.\n\nThe WHO gives a prevalence of 72.5% for the year of 2006. A 2003 survey found FGM to be prevalent in 77% of women in Burkina Faso. A 1998 survey reported a lower rate of 72%. This was not considered as evidence of an increase in the practice, but as reflecting the worldwide fact that better and more information is increasingly available on FGM. The prevalence varies with religion in Burkina Faso. FGM is prevalent in 82% of Muslim women, 73% of traditional religions, 66% of Roman Catholics and 60% of Protestants. \n\nIn a 2011 study on a wide range of variables, FGM prevalence characteristics in Burkina Faso was found to be strongly associated with religion, and age being the other important variable. A law prohibiting FGM was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in February 1997. Even before this law a presidential decree had set up the National Committee against excision and imposed fines on people guilty of excising girls and women. The new law includes stricter punishment. Several women excising girls have been handed prison sentences. Burkina Faso ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2006.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Cameroon. In a 2004 study, the FGM prevalence rate was 1.4%. Even though national rate is low, there are regions with high prevalence rate. In extreme north Cameroon, the prevalence rate is 13% for the Fulbe people and people of Arab descent. The prevalence varies with religion; FGM is prevalent in 6% of Muslim women, less than 1% of Christians, and 0% for Animist women. Cameroon's national penal code does not classify genital mutilation as a criminal offence. Article 277 criminalizes aggravated assault, including aggravated assault to organs. A draft law has been pending for over 10 years.\n\nWHO gives the prevalence of FGM in Central African Republic at 24.2% in 2010. A survey from 2000 found FGM was prevalent in 36% of Central African Republic women. This is a decline over the 1994 survey, which reported 43%. The prevalence in the 2000 survey varied with religion in Central African Republic; FGM was prevalent in 46% of Animist women, 39% of Muslim, 36% of Protestants, and 35% of Catholic women. \n\nIn 1996, the President issued an Ordinance prohibiting FGM throughout the country. It has the force of national law. Any violation of the Ordinance is punishable by imprisonment of from one month and one day to two years and a fine of 5,100 to 100,000 francs (approximately US$8–160). No arrests are known to have been made under the law. As FGM is less prevalent among younger women according to City University London in 2015, this suggested a decline in the practice.\n\nIn Chad's first survey on FGM in 2004, FGM prevalence rate was 45%. The prevalence varies with religion in Chad; FGM is prevalent in 61% of Muslim women, 31% of Catholics, 16% of Protestants, and 12% of traditional religions. The prevalence also varies with ethnic groups; the Arabs (95%), Hadjarai (94%), Ouadai (91%) and Fitri-batha (86%), and less than 2.5% among the Gorane, Tandjile and Mayo-Kebbi. Law no 6/PR/2002 on the promotion of reproductive health has provisions prohibiting FGM, but does not provide for sanctions. FGM may be punished under existing laws against assault, wounding, and mutilation of the body.\n\nFemale genital mutilation doesn't exist in Comoros.\n\nIn 2006, the prevalence of FGM was 36.4% among women aged 15–49 in Côte d’Ivoire. A 2005 survey found that 42% of all women aged between 15 and 49 had been subjected to FGM. This is similar to the FGM reported rate of 46% in 1998 and 43% in 1994. The prevalence varies with religion in Côte d'Ivoire; FGM is prevalent in 76% of Muslim women, 45% of Animist, 14% of Catholic and 13% of Protestant women. A 1998 law provides that harm to the integrity of the genital organ of a woman by complete or partial removal, excision, desensitization or by any other procedure will, if harmful to a woman's health, be punishable by imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of 360,000 to two million CFA Francs (approximately US$576–3,200). The penalty is five to twenty years incarceration if a death occurs during the procedure and up to five years' prohibition of medical practice, if this procedure is carried out by a doctor.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. FGM takes place among some populations in northern parts of the country. FGM is illegal: the law imposes a penalty of two to five years of prison and a fine of 200,000 Congolese francs on any person who violates the \"physical or functional integrity\" of the genital organs. The prevalence of FGM is estimated at about 5% of women in the country. Type II is usually performed.\n\nEstimates for FGM prevalence rate of FGM in Djibouti range from 93% to 98%. In a UNICEF 2010 report, Djibouti has the world's second highest rate of Type III FGM, with about two thirds of all Djibouti women undergoing the procedure; Type I is the next most common form of female circumcision practiced in the country. Like its neighboring countries, a large percentage of women in Djibouti also undergo re-infibulation after birth or a divorce. \n\nTwo thirds of the women claimed tradition and religion as the primary motivation for undergoing FGM. A predominantly Muslim country, Islamic clerics in Djibouti have been divided on the FGM issue, with some actively supporting the practice and others opposing it. FGM was outlawed in the country's revised Penal Code that went into effect in April 1995. Article 333 of the Penal Code provides that persons found guilty of this practice will face a five-year prison term and a fine of one million Djibouti francs (approximately US$5,600). Djibouti ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.\n\nEgypt's Ministry of Health and Population has banned all forms of female genital mutilation since 2007. The ministry's order declared it is 'prohibited for any doctors, nurses, or any other person to carry out any cut of, flattening or modification of any natural part of the female reproductive system'. Islamic authorities in the nation also stressed that Islam opposes female genital mutilation. The Grand Mufti of Egypt, Ali Gomaa, said that it is \"Prohibited, prohibited, prohibited.\" Egypt passed a law banning FGM. The June 2007 Ministry ban eliminated a loophole that allowed girls to undergo the procedure for health reasons. \n\nThere had previously been provisions under the Penal Code involving \"wounding\" and \"intentional infliction of harm leading to death\", as well as a ministerial decree prohibiting FGM. In December 1997, the Court of Cassation (Egypt's highest appeals court) upheld a government banning of the practice providing that those who did not comply would be subjected to criminal and administrative punishments. In Egypt's first trial for committing female genital mutilation, two men were acquitted in November 2014; the doctor was ordered to pay the girl's mother compensation. In 2015 after an appeal the doctor was sentenced to more than two years in prison and the father was given a three-month suspended sentence. On 30 May 2018, the Dar al-Ifta al-Misriyyah, a governmental body which advises on Islamic law, declared FGM 'religiously forbidden'. Health Minister Ahmed Emad el-Din Rady presented a six-step plan to eliminate FGM in Egypt by 2030.\n\nA study in 2000 found that 97% of Egypt's population practiced FGM. A 2005 study found that over 95% of Egyptian women have undergone some form of FGM. In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence had dropped to 91%. The 2016 UNICEF report stated that the share of girls aged 15 to 19 who had undergone FGM dropped from 97% in 1985 to 70% in 2015. The percentage of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who had\nundergone FGM in the years 2004–2015 was 87%, while girls aged 0 to 14 years who had undergone FGM in the years 2010–2015 numbered 14%. 38% of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years who had heard about FGM thought the practice should end, while 28% of the boys and men those ages did.\n\nThe government of Eritrea surveyed and published an official FGM prevalence rate of 89% in 2003. It was once over 93%. Historically, about 50% of the women in rural areas underwent Type III with stitching to close the vulva, while Type I and II was more common in urban areas. Overall, about a third of all women in Eritrea have undergone Type III FGM with stitching. Most FGM (68%) are performed on baby girls less than 1 year old, another 20% before they turn 5 year old. About 60% and 18% of Eritrean women believe FGM is a religious requirement, according to UNICEF, and the Eritrean government, respectively. \n\nThe prevalence varies with woman's religion, as well as by their ethnic group. A 2002 UNICEF study shows FGM prevalence among 99% of Muslim, 89% of Catholic and 85% of Protestant women aged 15–49 years. Eritrea outlawed all forms of female genital mutilation with Proclamation 158/2007 in March 2007. The law envisions a fine and imprisonment for anyone conducting or commissioning FGM.\n\nThe WHO gives a prevalence of 65% for FGM in Ethiopia (2016) in women age 15-49 and falling to 47.1 in those 15–19 years. In a 2016 UNICEF report, Ethiopia's regional prevalence of FGM is : Afar Region – 91.2%; Somali Region – 98.5%; Harari Region – 81.7%; Dire Dawa 75.3%; Amhara Region – 1.4% to 21.9%; Oromia Region – 75.6%; Addis Ababa City – 54%; Benishangul-Gumuz Region – 62.9%; Tigray Region – 24.2%; Southern Region – 62%; Gambela Region 33%. By ethnicity, it has a prevalence of 98.5% in Somali; 92.3% Hadiya; 98.4% Afar and 23% Tigray. The prevalence also varies with religion in Ethiopia; FGM is prevalent in 92% of Muslim women and with lower prevalence in other religions: 65.8% Protestants, 58.2% Catholics and 55% Traditional Religions. FGM has been made illegal by the 2004 Penal Code.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Gambia. In a 2013 report, an estimated 76.3% of girls and women have been subjected to FGM/C. A 2006 UNICEF survey found a 78.3% prevalence rate in Gambia. The age when FGM is done on Gambian girls ranges from 7 days after birth up to pre-adolescence. \n\nGambia's predominant religion is Islam (90%), and it has many ethnic groups. Prevalence rates of FGM/C vary significantly between the ethnic groups: Sarahule (FGM rate of 98%), Mandinka (97%), Djola (87%), Serer (43%), and Wolof (12%). Urban areas report FGM/C rates of about 56%, whereas in rural areas, rates exceed 90%. A majority of Gambian women who underwent FGM/C claimed they did it primarily because religion mandates it. \n\nA 2011 clinical study reports 66% FGMs in Gambia were Type I, 26% were Type II and 8% Type III. About a third of all women in Gambia with FGM/C, including Type I, suffered health complications because of the procedure. In 2015, Gambia's president Yahya Jammeh has banned FGM. As FGM is less prevalent among younger women according to City University London in 2015, this suggested a decline in the practice.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Ghana. According to the WHO, its prevalence is 3.8%. In 1989, the head of the government of Ghana, President Rawlings, issued a formal declaration against FGM. Article 39 of Ghana's Constitution also provides in part that traditional practices that are injurious to a person's health and well being are abolished. The Criminal Code was amended in 1994 to outlaw FGM, and the law was strengthened in 2007. Ghana ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007.\n\nGuinea has the second highest FGM prevalence rate in the world. In a 2005 survey, 96% of all Guinea women aged between 15 and 49 had been cut. That is a slight decline in the practice from the 1999 recorded FGM rate of 98.6%. Among the 15- to 19-year-olds the prevalence was 89%, among 20- to 24-year-olds 95%. About 50% of the women in Guinea believe FGM is a religious requirement. Guinea is predominantly a Muslim country, with 90% of the population practicing Islam. The high FGM rates are observed across all religions in Guinea; FGM is prevalent in 99% of Muslim women, 94% of Catholics and Protestants, and 93% of Animist women. \n\nFGM is illegal in Guinea under Article 265 of the Penal Code. The law sentences death to the perpetrator if the girl dies within 40 days after the FGM. Article 6 of the Guinean Constitution, which outlaws cruel and inhumane treatment, could be interpreted to include these practices, should a case be brought to the Supreme Court. Guinea signed the Maputo Protocol in 2003 but has not ratified it. \n\nArticle 305 of Guinea’s penal code also bans FGM, but nobody has yet been sentenced under any of Guinea's FGM-related laws. In Guinea, instead of stopping FGM, the trend is towards medicalisation of FGM, where the mutilation is advertised under hygienic conditions by medically trained staff, who see FGM practice an additional source of income. Per the above 2005 survey, 27% of girls were cut by medically trained staff.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Guinea-Bissau, and have been estimated at a 50% prevalence rate in 2000. A law banning the practice nationwide was adopted by Parliament in June 2011 with 64 votes to 1. At the time, 45% of women aged 15 to 49 years were affected by FGM. According to a survey, 33% of women favoured a continuation of genital cutting, but 50% of the overall population wanted to abandon the practice.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Kenya. The 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) estimated the national prevalence of FGM to be 21% among women age 15-49, down from 27% in the 2008/09 survey and 32 percent in the 2003 survey. The prevalence of FGM in 2014 varied widely by age, location, ethnic group, and religion. Prevalence of FGM increases with age. It is lowest among women ages 15–19 at 11.4%, and highest among women aged 45–49 at 40.9%. This trend underscores the declining trend in FGM over time. \n\nBy region, prevalence is highest in the former provinces of North Eastern (97.5%), Nyanza (32.4%), Rift Valley (26.9%), and Eastern (26.4%), and lower in Central (16.5%), Coast (10.2%), Nairobi (8.0%), and Western (0.8%). It is more common in rural areas (25.9%) than urban (13.8%). By ethnic group, FGM is most prevalent among women in the Somali (93.6%), Samburu (86.0%), Kisii (84.4%), and Maasai (77.9%) ethnic groups. By religion, it is more prevalent in Muslim women (51.1%) and women listing no religion (32.9%) and less prevalent in Roman Catholic (21.5%) and Protestant or other Christian women (17.9%).\n\nIn 2001 Kenya enacted the Children’s Act, under the provisions of which FGM was criminalized when practiced on girls younger than 18. The practice was made illegal nationwide in September 2011.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Liberia. Genital mutilation is a taboo subject in Liberia. It is difficult to get accurate data on FGM prevalence rate. The FGM procedure is mandatory for initiation of women into the secret Liberia and Sierra Leone society called the Sande society, sometimes called Bondo. A 2007 demographic survey asked women if they belonged to Sande society. It was assumed that those who were part of Sande society had undergone FGM. Based on this estimation method, the prevalence of FGM in Liberia has been estimated as 58%. Liberia has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol. National legislation explicitly making FGM punishable by law has yet to be passed. As FGM was less prevalent among younger women in a 2015 study, this suggested a decline in the practice.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is rarely practiced in Libya. Likely to be found in rural areas.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in Malawi mostly in the following districts of Malawi. Southern Malawi: Mulanje, Thyolo, Mangochi and parts of Machinga and Chiradzuro District. In the Northern part of Malawi: Nkhatabay. This custom is common among the Tonga tribe, Yao tribe and Lomwe tribe. It is a custom which has been there for generation. In some villages it is deeply routed compared to others . Every FGM camp has its own degree of how deep they want to conduct the custom but the motive is the same. It is shrouded in silence. Not even the government authorities can trace the roots because the high powers are given to the local authorities of the village and clan.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Mali. The WHO gives a prevalence of 85.2% for women aged 15–49 in 2006 in Mali. In a 2007 report, 92% of all Mali women between the ages of 15 and 49 had been subjected to FGM. The rates of FGM are lower only among the Sonrai (28%), the Tamachek (32%) and the Bozo people (76%). Nearly half are Type I, another half Type II. The prevalence varies with religion in Mali; FGM is prevalent in 92% of Muslim women, 76% of Christians. \n\nAbout 64% of the women of Mali believe FGM is a religious requirement. In 2002, Mali created a government program aimed at discouraging FGM (\"Ordinance No. 02-053 portant creation du programme national de lutte contre la pratique de l’excision\" [Ordinance creating a National Program to Fight the Practice of Female Genital Mutilation]). There is no specific legislation criminalizing FGM.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Mauritania. According to 2001 survey, 71% of all women aged between 15 and 49 had undergone FGM. A 2007 demographic cluster study found no change in FGM prevalence rate in Mauritania. Type II FGM is most frequent. About 57% of Mauritania women believe FGM is a religious requirement. Mauritania is 99% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by ethnic groups: 92% of Soninke women are cut, about 70% of Fulbe and Moorish women, but only 28% of Wolof women have undergone FGM. Mauritania has consented to international charters such as CEDAW as well as Africa's Maputo Protocol. Ordonnance n°2005-015 on child protection restricts FGM.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Mozambique.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Niger. In a 2006 survey, about 2% of Niger women had undergone FGM/C. In 1998, Niger reported a 4.5% prevalence rate. This survey data is potentially incorrect because, adjusted for age group, the women who claimed to have experienced FGM at the previous survey still are, albeit in a different age group. The 2006 survey implies more women had never experienced FGM than previously reported. The DHS surveyors claim the adoption of criminal legislation and fear of prosecution may explain why Niger women did not want to report having ever been circumcised. A WHO report estimates the prevalence rate of FGM in Niger to be 20%. Other sources, including a UNICEF 2009 report, claim FGM rates are high in Niger. A law banning FGM was passed in 2003 by the Niger government.\n\nA 2008 demographic survey found 30% of all Nigerian women have been subjected to FGM. This contrasts with 25% reported by a 1999 survey, and 19% by 2003 survey. This suggests no trend, unreliable past or most recent survey data in some regions, as well as the possibility that a number of women are increasingly willing to acknowledge having undergone FGM. Another possible explanation for higher 2008 prevalence rate is the definition of FGM used, which included Type IV FGMs. In some parts of Nigeria, the vagina walls are cut in new born girls or other traditional practices performed - such as the \"angurya\" and \"gishiri\" cuts - which fall under Type IV FGM classification of the World Health Organization. Over 80% of all FGMs are performed on girls under one year of age. The prevalence varies with religion in Nigeria; FGM is prevalent in 31% of Catholics, 27% of Protestant and 7% of Muslim women. FGM was banned throughout the country in 2015.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in the Republic of the Congo, and has been estimated at a 5% prevalence rate.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Senegal. According to 2005 survey, FGM prevalence rate is 28% of all women aged between 15 and 49. There are significant differences in regional prevalence. FGM is most widespread in the Southern Senegal (94% in Kolda Region) and in Northeastern Senegal (93% in Matam Region). FGM rates are lower in other regions: Tambacounda (86%), Ziguinchor (69%), and less than 5% in Diourbel and Louga Regions. Senegal is 94% Muslim. The FGM prevalence rate varies by religion: 29% of Muslim women have undergone FGM, 16% of Animists, and 11% of Christian women. \n\nA law that was passed in January 1999 makes FGM illegal in Senegal. President Diouf had appealed for an end to this practice and for legislation outlawing it. The law modifies the Penal Code to make this practice a criminal act, punishable by a sentence of one to five years in prison. A spokesperson for the human rights group RADDHO (The African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights) noted in the local press that \"Adopting the law is not the end, as it will still need to be effectively enforced for women to benefit from it. Senegal ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Sierra Leone. According to a 2008 survey, 91% of women in Sierra Leone between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone FGM. The highest rate of prevalence is in the Northern Sierra Leone (97%). Type II is most common, but Type I is known as well as Type III. In a 2013 report, researchers first conducted verbal surveys followed by clinical examination. They found that the verbal disclosure were not completely reliable, and clinical examination showed greater extent of FGM. These researchers report 68% Type II and 32% Type I in Sierra Leone women. \n\nLike Liberia, Sierra Leone has the traditional secret society of women, called Bondo or Sande society, which uses FGM as part of the initiation rite. 70% of the population is Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% as traditional religions. Only Creole Christians of Sierra Leone are known to not practice FGM. There is no federal law against FGM in Sierra Leone; and the \"Soweis\" - those who do FGM excision - wield considerable political power during elections.\n\nAccording to a 2005 WHO estimate, about 97.9% of Somalia's women and girls underwent FGM. This was at the time the world's highest prevalence rate of the procedure. A 2010 UNICEF report also noted that Somalia had the world's highest rate of Type III FGM, with 79% of all Somali women having undergone the procedure; another 15% underwent Type II FGM. The prevalence rate varies considerably by region and is on the decline in the northern part of the country. In 2013, UNICEF in conjunction with the Somali authorities reported that the FGM prevalence rate among 1- to 14-year-old girls in the autonomous northern Puntland and Somaliland regions had dropped to 25% following a social and religious awareness campaign. Article 15 of the Federal Constitution adopted in August 2012 also prohibits female circumcision.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in South Africa.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in South Sudan, but its exact prevalence is unknown. A 2015 UNICEF report claimed 1% of women aged 15–49 had been subjected to FGM, but as of May 2018 there were no recent data confirming this figure. FGM has been reported to be practiced in some Christian and Muslims communities, and has been noted in some refugee camps in Upper Nile State. South Sudanese law has banned female genital mutilation, but the government has not enacted a clear plan to eradicate the phenomenon.\n\nThe prevalence of FGM in Sudan is 90%. Only some states of Sudan have laws against FGM; currently there is no national law forbidding FGM, although Sudan was the first country to outlaw it in 1946, under the British. Type III was prohibited under the 1925 Penal Code, with less severe forms allowed. Outreach groups have been trying to eradicate the practice for 50 years, working with NGOs, religious groups, the government, the media and medical practitioners. Arrests have been made but no further action seems to have taken place. Sudan signed the Maputo Protocol in June, 2008 but no ratification has yet been deposited with the African Union.\n\nAccording to 2015-16 survey in Tanzania, FGM prevalence rate is 10% of all women aged between 15 and 49 and 4.7% for those aged 15–19. In contrast, the 1996 survey reported 17.6, suggesting a drop of 7.6% over 20 years or unwillingness to disclose. Type II FGM was found to be most common. There are significant differences in regional prevalence; FGM is most widespread in Manyara (81%), Dodoma (68%), Arusha (55%), Singida (43%) and Mara (38%) regions. The practice varies with religion, with reported prevalence rates of 20% for Christian and 15% of Muslim women. \n\nSection 169A of the Sexual Offences Special Provisions Act of 1998 prohibits FGM in Tanzania. Punishment is imprisonment of from five to fifteen years or a fine not exceeding 300,000 shillings (approximately US$250) or both. Tanzania ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2007. As with Kenya, Tanzania 1998 Act protects only girls up to the age of 18 years. The FGM law is being occasionally implemented, with 52 violations have been reported, filed and prosecuted. At least 10 cases were convicted in Tanzania.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in Togo. In a 2014 UNICEF report, the prevalence is 1.8% in girls 15-19. The WHO puts its prevalence at 5.8% in 2006. Other sources cite 12% and 50% as prevalence. Type II is usually practiced. On October 30, 1998, the National Assembly unanimously voted to outlaw the practice of FGM. Penalties under the law can include a prison term of two months to ten years and a fine of 100,000 francs to one million francs (approximately US$160 to 1,600). A person who had knowledge that the procedure was going to take place and failed to inform public authorities can be punished with one month to one year imprisonment or a fine of from 20,000 to 500,000 francs (approximately US$32 to 800). Togo ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.\n\nAnyone convicted of carrying out FGM is subject to 10 years in prison. If the life of the patient is lost during the operation a life sentence is recommended. In 1996, a court intervened to prevent the performance of FGM under Section 8 of the Children Statute, which makes it unlawful to subject a child to social or customary practices harmful to the child's health. Uganda signed the Maputo Protocol in 2003 but has not ratified it. In early July 2009, President Yoweri Museveni stated that a law would soon be passed prohibiting the practice, with alternative livelihoods found for its practitioners.\nThe anti FGM act 2010 is currently available for reference.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn recent years the increase in immigration for individuals from countries which practice FGM, has led to the introduction of FGM in European and North American societies. FGM prevalence rate has been difficult to quantify among immigrants to European countries. A case study which investigated FGM in groups of migrant women from Northern Africa to European regions like Scandinavia, noted that a majority of these women had FGM before their migration to Europe. \n\nIt has also been established that African communities in European countries continue the practice of FGM on their daughters after migrating to Europe. For instance in Sweden, a study by Karolinska Institutet concluded that about a third of families migrated from countries with a FGM culture wanted to continue mutilating in their new countries. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, which came into force on 1 August 2014, defines and criminalize the practice in Article 38:\nBetween 1979 and 2004, a total of 29 FGM court cases were brought before criminal courts, mostly from the\nmid-1990s onwards and with aggravated sentences. By 2013, more than 100 people had been convicted of FGM. FGM is a criminal offense punishable by 10 years or up to 20 years in jail if the victim is under 15 years of age. The law requires anyone to report any case of mutilation or planned mutilation. In 2014 it was reported that about 100 people in France had been jailed. Not only the person carrying out the mutilation is sentenced, parents organising the crime face legal proceedings as well.\n\nAccording to women's right organisation Terre des Femmes in 2014, there were 25,000 victims in Germany and a further 2,500 are under threat of becoming mutilated. In 2018, the estimate had increased to . A further were at risk of having the mutilation done to them which represented an increase of 17% on the previous year.\n\nAfter a few cases of infibulation practiced by complaisant medical practitioners within the African immigrant community came to public knowledge through media coverage, the Law n°7/2006 was passed on 1/9/2006, becoming effective on 1/28/2006, concerning \"Measures of prevention and prohibition of any female genital mutilation practice\"; the Act is also known as the \"Legge Consolo\" (\"Consolo Act\") named after its primary promoter, Senator Giuseppe Consolo. Article 6 of the law integrates the Italian Penal Code with Articles 583-\"Bis\" and 583-\"Ter\", punishing any practice of female genital mutilation \"not justifiable under therapeutical or medical needs\" with imprisonment ranging from 4 to 12 years (3 to 7 years for any mutilation other than, or less severe than, clitoridectomy, excision or infibulation).\n\nThe penalty can be reduced up to if the harm caused is of modest entity (i.e. if partially or completely unsuccessful), but may also be elevated up to if the victim is a minor or if the offense has been committed for profit. An Italian citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in Italy can be punished under this law even if the offense is committed abroad; the law will as well afflict any individual of any citizenship in Italy, even illegally or provisionally. The law also mandates any medical practitioner found guilty under those provisions to have his/her medical license revoked for a minimum of six up to a maximum of ten years.\n\nFGM is considered mutilation and is punishable as a criminal offense under Dutch law. There is no specific law against FGM: the act is subsumed under the general offense of inflicting harm (\"mishandeling\" in Dutch, art. 300–304 Dutch Criminal Code). The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of 12 years. The sentence can be higher if the offender is a family member of the victim. It is also illegal to assist or encourage another person to perform FGM. A Dutch citizen or a foreign citizen legally resident in the Netherlands can be punished even if the offense is committed abroad. Doctors have the obligation to report suspected cases of FGM and may break patient confidentiality rules if necessary.\n\nFGM is punishable as a criminal offense under Norwegian law even if the offense is committed abroad.\n\nA study on female genital mutilation practiced in Dagestan, made public in 2016 by Legal Initiative for Russia, revealed that FGM is widespread in Dagestan. The girls undergo mutilation in early age, up to three years old. The practice has been publicly approved in the predominantly Muslim region of Dagestan by religious leaders such as Mufti Ismail Berdiyev. Later an Orthodox Christian priest also backed the cleric.\n\nThe Criminal Code does state that sexual mutilation, such as FGM, is a criminal offense punishable by up to 12 years in jail, even if the offence is committed abroad.\n\nIn 1982, Sweden was the first western country in the world to explicitly prohibit genital mutilation. It is punishable by up to ten years in prison, and in 1999 the Government extended the law to include procedures performed abroad. General child protection laws could also be used. The prevalence of FGM among immigrant groups in Sweden is unknown, but there have been 46 cases of suspected genital mutilation since the law was introduced in 1982, and two convictions, according to a report published in 2011 by the National Centre for Knowledge on Men's Violence against Women.\n\nIn June 2014, Norrköpings Tidningar published a story on genital mutilation, which was picked up by the foreign press, including The Independent and The Daily News. It was claimed that every single girl in one school class had been victims of genital mutilation. None of the newspapers said where and when the genital mutilation took place. It was later published by Sweden's national public radio that none of the girls had been subjected to the procedure, or had any procedure performed on them abroad, while living in Sweden.\n\nThe National Board of Health and Welfare has estimated that up to 38,000 women living in Sweden may have been the victims of FGM. This calculation is based on UNICEF estimates on prevalence rates in Africa, and refer to FGM carried out before arriving in Sweden. In 2014, a Somali-born national coordinator at the County Administrative Board of Östergötland said the problem is not actively being pursued by authorities and the issue is avoided for fear of being perceived as racist or as stigmatising minority ethnic groups. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs launched an action plan against FGM in 2003, which included giving courses to African women and men, who are now working as health advisors and influencing the public opinion among their fellow countrymen. The Government have also issued guidelines for officials in the social sector concerning actions and measures in a variety of situations.\n\nFGM was made a criminal offence by the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985. This was superseded by the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003, and (in Scotland) by the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005. Taking a UK citizen or permanent resident abroad for the purpose of FGM is a criminal offence whether or not it is lawful in the country the girl is taken to. Since April 2014, all NHS hospitals will be able to record if a patient has undergone FGM or if there is a family history of this, and by September 2014, all acute hospitals will have to report this data to the Department of Health, on a monthly basis. Despite FGM being illegal since 1985 the authorities are yet to prosecute even one case successfully.\n\nThe number of women aged 15–49 resident in England and Wales born in FGM practising regions having migrated to the UK was in 2001 and increased to in 2011. The number of women born in the Horn of Africa, where FGM is nearly universal and the most severe types of FGM, infubulation, is commonly practised, increased from in 2001 to in 2011, an increase of . \n\nThe number of women of all ages having undergone FGM rituals was estimated to be in 2011. The number of women of ages 15–49 having undergone FGM rituals was estimated to in 2001 and there was an increase to in 2011. Additionally, approximately 10,000 girls aged under 15 and 24,000 women over 50, who have migrated to England and Wales, are likely to have undergone FGM.\n\nThe city with the highest prevalence of FGM in 2015 was London, at a rate of 28.2 per 1000 women aged 15–49, by far the highest. The borough with the highest rate was Southwark, at 57.5 per 1000 women, while mainly rural areas of the UK had prevalence rate below 1 per 1000.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Bahrain.\n\nNational data on FGM in Iran are unknown. Various studies have been conducted on prevalence in provinces and counties, suggesting significant regional differences. FGM is known to be prevalent in four provinces: West Azerbaijan Province (mostly the Kurdish populated southern part), Kurdistan Province and Kermanshah Province in the Kurdish-dominated northwest, and Hormozgan Province and islands near it in the south.\n\nFGM in Iran is primarily associated with Sunni Muslims following the Shafi‘i madhhab, especially those living in certain Kurdish-populated rural areas in northwestern Iran, adjacent to the Kurdish-speaking regions in northeastern Iraq where FGM also has a relatively high presence compared to the non-Kurdish areas around it. There is strong disparity even within the Kurdish communities, and the prevalence may differ considerably from one village to the next. Unlike the Iraqi Kurdistan government, which has implemented a relatively successful anti-FGM campaign, official representatives as well as nationalist individuals or groups tend to deny FGM even exists in Iran. In the southern province of Hormozgan, FGM is mostly practiced by (Persian) Sunnis, but also a small minority of Shias living near them.\n\nThe issue is rarely discussed in public; the national Shia religious establishment claims it as an exclusively Sunni practice in which it should not get involved, and generally sees no reason to try and end it. It is also rarely the subject of research in academia, with the government neither permitting nor funding any public engagement projects for the affected regions.\n\nIn 2016, Susie Latham reported that FGC had been abandoned around the capital of the south-western province Khuzestan in the 1950s. Research by Kameel Ahmady (2005–2015) also revealed the practice had been abandoned in several other parts of Iran, such as among Shia Kurdish women in parts of Kermanshah and Ilam Province.\n\nSome studies estimate the Type I and II FGM among Iraqi migrants and other Kurdish minority groups to be variable, ranging from 40% to 85%.\nAssuming FGM had no significant presence in other provinces, this would amount to a national prevalence of c. 2% in Iran in 2014.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in Iraqi Kurdistan, with an FGM rate of 72% according to the 2010 WADI report for the entire region and exceeding 80% in Garmyan and New Kirkuk. In Arbil Governorate and Suleymaniya Type I FGM is common; while in Garmyan and New Kirkuk, Type II and III FGM are common. There was no law against FGM in Iraqi Kurdistan, but in 2007 a draft legislation condemning the practice was submitted to the Regional Parliament, but was not passed. A 2011 Kurdish law criminalized FGM practice in Iraqi Kurdistan and this law is not being enforced. \n\nA field report by Iraqi group PANA Center, published in 2012, shows 38% of females in Kirkuk and its surrounding districts areas had undergone female circumcision. Of those females circumcised, 65% were Kurds, 26% Arabs and rest Turkmen. On the level of religious and sectarian affiliation, 41% were Sunnis, 23% Shiites, rest Kaka’is, and none Christians or Chaldeans. A 2013 report finds FGM prevalence rate of 59% based on clinical examination of about 2000 Iraqi Kurdish women; FGM found were Type I, and 60% of the mutilation were performed to girls in 4–7 year age group. See Asuda, a Kurdistan NGO. The highest prevalence rates of FGM are in Kirkuk (20%), Sulaymaniyah (54%) and Erbil (58%).\n\nResidents of Wadi Araba village in southern Jordan are known to practice FGM. The practice is foreign to the rest of the country, experts speculate that this practise was introduced through descendants of tribes that came from neighbouring Gaza and Beer Sheba.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is not practiced in Kuwait. Few ethnic migrant minorities are believed to perform the procedure outside of public health institutions where they risk injury and infections.\n\nThe practice is very prevalent in Oman. A 2013 article by journalist Susan Mubarak describes FGM practice in Oman, and claims the practice is very common in Dhofar in the southwest. The author went on to say that a previous article on the topic received both positive feedback for spreading awareness of what some considered a 'horrific tradition', as well as negative feedback from others for 'hanging Dhofar’s dirty washing for the world to see and criticising a practice that they believe is purely Islamic,' commenting that she 'paid little attention to these criticisms because I know the practice is harmful and primitive', and 'our religion neither encourages the practice nor condemns it.' \n\nAccording to a small survey by human rights activist and statistician Habiba Al Hinai conducted in October 2013 and published in January 2014, 78% of 100 women interviewed living in the capital city of Muscat had undergone FGM. These women came from all parts of the country, each region showing a very high prevalence, and even though fewer women from Muscat itself had undergone FGM, they were still in the majority. Her findings contradicted the common belief that FGM was only widespread in the south. Type I is mostly performed in southern Oman and typically performed within a few weeks of a girl's birth, while Type IV is observed in other parts of northern Oman.\n\nFGM otherwise is not practice in Oman neither is considered prominent by the World Health Organization.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Palestine.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Qatar.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Saudi Arabia. FGM is most prevalent in Saudi regions following Shafi'i school within the Sunni sect of Islam, such as Hejaz, Tihamah and Asir. In a clinical study, Alsibiani and Rouzi provide evidence of the practice in Saudi Arabia. Another 2010 report claims post-FGM medical complications are an indicator of widespread prevalence of the practice in Saudi women. A 2012 study finds, that of the Saudi women who had FGM, Type III was more common than Type I or II.\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests FGM exists in Syria. A 2012 conference confirmed that FGM is observed in Syria.\n\nThough there is little hard evidence of the practice of FGM in Turkey, circumstantial evidence suggests FGM exists in the southern Turkey where the majority of the population is Kurdish.\n\nThe WHO mentions a study that documents FGM in the United Arab Emirates, but does not provide data. The practice is reportedly prevalent in rural and urban UAE.) In a 2011 survey, 34% of Emirati female respondents said FGM had been performed on them, and explained the practice to customs and tradition. FGM is a controversial topic in UAE, and people argue about whether it is an Islamic requirement or a tribal tradition. A significant number of UAE nationals follow in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents without questioning the practice. A 2012 report published by UAE government scores UAE at 31% on prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation.\n\nAccording to a 2008 UNICEF report, 30% prevalence; in addition to the adult prevalence, UNICEF reports that 20% of women aged 15–49 have a daughter who had the procedure in Yemen. In 4 of Yemen's 21 governorates, according to a 2008 report, the FGM prevalence rates exceed 80%: al-Hudaydah (97%), Hadhramaut (97%), al-Mahrah (97%) and Adan (82%); Sana'a Governorate, which includes the capital of Yemen, has a prevalence rate of 46%. Type II FGM was most common, accounting for 83% of all FGMs. Type I FGMs accounted for 13%. \n\nYemeni tradition is to carry out the FGM on a new born, with 97% of FGM being done within the first month of a baby girl. In 2001, Yemen banned FGM in all private and public medical facilities by a government decree, but not homes. The Yemeni government did not enforce this decree. In 2009, conservative Yemeni parliamentarians opposed the adoption of a nationwide criminal law against FGM. In 2010, the Ministry of Human Rights of Yemen launched a new study to ascertain over 4 years if FGM is being practiced in Yemen, then propose a new law against FGM. A 2013 UNICEF report claims Yemen's FGM prevalence rate have not changed in last 30 years.\n\nThere is some evidence to indicate that FGM is practised in Ontario and across Canada among immigrant and refugee communities. FGM is considered child assault and prohibited under sections 267 (assault causing bodily harm) or 268 (aggravated assault, including wounding, maiming, disfiguring) of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control estimated in 1997 that 168,000 girls living in the United States had undergone FGM or were at risk. Khalid Adem, a Muslim who had moved from Ethiopia to Atlanta, Georgia, became the first person to be convicted in the US in an FGM case; he was sentenced to ten years in 2006 for having severed his two-year-old daughter's clitoris with a pair of scissors. Performing the procedure on anyone under the age of 18 became illegal in the U.S. in 1997 with the \"Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act\". \n\nAs of 2018, 27 U.S. states have specific laws against FGM. States that do not have such laws may use other general statutes, such as assault, battery or child abuse. The \"Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act\" was passed in January 2013, and prohibits knowingly transporting a girl out of the U.S. for the purpose of undergoing FGM.\n\nFauziya Kasinga, a 19-year-old member of the Tchamba-Kunsuntu tribe of Togo, was granted asylum in 1996 after leaving an arranged marriage to escape FGM; this set a precedent in US immigration law because it was the first time FGM was accepted as a form of persecution.\n\nIn 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report compiled with data from 2010-2013. The 2013 study estimated 513,000 girls and women in the United States were either victims of FGM or at risk of FGM, with ⅓ under age 18. The marked increase in the number of girls and women at risk of FGM in the United States was attributed to an increase in the total number of immigrants from countries where FGM is most common, not an increase in the frequency of the practice.\n\nThe only indigenous tribe in Latin America known to practise FGM is Colombia's Emberá people. The tradition was extremely secretive and taboo until a 2007 incident, in which a girl died as a result of FGM. The incident caused much controversy, raised awareness and stimulated debate about ending the practice altogether. In 2015, it was reported that of the approximately 250,000 members of the tribe, 25,000 (10%) had decided to discontinue female genital mutilation, with a community leader saying they hoped to eradicate it by 2030.\n\nIn 1994 there were several anecdotal reports of FGM being practised amongst migrant communities in Australia. By 1997, all Australian states and territories had made FGM a criminal offence. It is also a criminal offence to take, or propose to take, a child outside Australia to have a FGM procedure performed. The incidence of FGM in Australia is unknown as it is often only uncovered when women and girls are taken to hospital due to complications with the procedure. In 2015 two unnamed women became the first people in Australia to be convicted of carrying out FGM; their case was also the first time such an offense had come to trial in Australia.\n\nIn 2017 the first national study by researches at the Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney found 59 girls having attended medical staff since 2010, with many having had the most extreme form of the procedure done to them. A fifth of those had infibulation, the removal of the clitoris and external genitalia with the opening sewed up. The number was deemed to strongly underestimate the true number of cases. Most of the procedures had been done overseas, but two children born in Australia had the procedure done in New South Wales and a third child born in Australia had been taken to Indonesia to have the procedure done. Of the 59 girls, only 13 had been in contact with child protection services. Most (about 90%) were identified during refugee screening and had African origin.The report also stated that there was no FGM registry in Australia and even when detected is not routinely reported. The two most common countries of birth for the girls were Somalia (24) and Eritrea (12).\n\nUnder a 1995 amendment to the Crimes Act, it is illegal to perform \"any medical or surgical procedure or mutilation of the vagina or clitoris of any person\" for reasons of \"culture, religion, custom or practice\". It is also illegal to send or make any arrangement for a child to be sent out of New Zealand for FGM to be performed, assist or encourage any person in New Zealand to perform FGM on a New Zealand citizen or resident outside New Zealand convince or encourage any other New Zealand citizen or resident to go outside New Zealand to have FGM performed.\n\nAnti-FGM organisations in Asia have complained that global attention on eradicating FGM goes almost entirely to Africa. Consequently, few studies have been done into FGM in Asian countries, complicating anti-FGM campaigns due to a lack of data on the phenomenon. Indian activist Masooma Ranalvi, who underwent FGM as a 7-year-old, was quoted as saying: \"[T]he entire discourse on FGM up to now has centred on Africa. Africa of course needs attention but maybe there are other places where the focus can be spread to.\"\n\nFemale genital mutilation is present in Afghanistan, mainly in south border connecting to Pakistan.\n\nFemale genital mutilation Type IV is present in Brunei.\n\nThe practice of FGM constitutes a criminal offense under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. Estimates suggest 90% of females in the Ismaili Shia Muslim Bohra community in India undergo FGM. There are about 2 million Bohras in India.In a survey, over 70% Bohra respondents said an untrained professional had performed the procedure on them. Female genital cutting is being practiced in Kerala was found on August 2017 by Sahiyo reporters. Apart from the mental trauma, the women also said it also led to physical complications. \n\nOn May 9, 2017 the Supreme Court of India sought a response from the Centre and four states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan) on the validity of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) when Public Interest Litigation by some Bohra women to ban the practice. On July 9, 2018, Attorney General of India K. K. Venugopal reiterated the Indian government's position that FGM was a violation of a person's fundamental rights and that its practice resulted in serious health complications for the girl concerned.\n\nFemale genital mutilation Type I and IV is prevalent in Indonesia; 97.5% of the surveyed females from Muslim families (Muslim females are at least 85% of females in Indonesia) are mutilated by age 18 (55 million females as of 2018). In certain communities of Indonesia, mass female circumcision (\"khitanan massal\") ceremony are organized by local Islamic foundations around Prophet Muhammad’s birthday. Some FGM are Type IV done with a pen knife, others are Type I done with scissors. Two Indonesian nationwide studies in 2003 and 2010 found over 80% of the cases sampled involved cutting, typically of newborns through the age of 9. The surveys demonstrated that circumcision among girls and boys is a universal practice in the study sites, in all of which Islam was the primary religion. Across the sites, among all the children aged 15–18, 86-100% of the girls were reported already circumcised. More than 90% of families visited in the studies claimed they wanted the practice to continue.\n\nHistorical records suggest female circumcision in Indonesia started and became prevalent with the arrival of Islam in the 13th century as part of its drive to convert people to Islam. In islands of Indonesia, where partial populations converted to Islam in the 17th century, FGM has been prevalent in Muslim females only. In 2006, FGM was banned by the government but FGM/C remained commonplace for women in Indonesia - the world’s largest Muslim nation. In 2010, the Indonesian Health Ministry issued a decree outlining the proper procedure for FGM, which activists claim contradicted the 2006 ruling prohibiting clinics from performing any FGM.\n\nIn 2013, the Indonesian Ulema Council ruled that it favors FGM, stating that although it is not mandatory, it is still “morally recommended”. The Ulema has been pushing Indonesian government to circumcise girls, claiming it is part of Islamic teachings. Some Indonesian officials, in March 2013, claimed cutting and pricking type circumcision is not FGM. In 2014 the government criminalized all forms of FGM after it repealed exceptions to the laws.\n\nAccording to 2016 report by UNICEF, 49% of Indonesian girls of age below 14 had already undergone FGM/C by 2015.\n\nFemale genital mutilation Type I is prevalent in Malaysia, where 93% of females from Muslim families (about 9 million females) in an unpublished study have been mutilated. It is widely considered as a female sunnah tradition (\"sunat perempuan\"), typically in the old days done by midwife (\"mak bidan\") and now by medical physician. It is either a minor prick or cutting off a small piece of the highest part of clitoral hood and foreskin (Type I). Malaysian women claim religious obligation (82%) as the primary reason for female circumcision, with hygiene (41%) and cultural practice (32%) as other major motivators for FGM prevalence. \n\nMalaysia is a multicultural society, FGM is prevalent in Muslim community, and not observed in its minority Buddhist and Hindu communities. Malaysia has no laws in reference to FGM. The Malaysian government sponsored 86th conference of Malaysia’s Fatwa Committee National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs held in April 2009 decided that female circumcision is part of Islamic teachings and it should be observed by Muslims, with the majority of the jurists in the Committee concluding that female circumcision is obligatory (\"wajib\"). The \"fatwa\" noted harmful circumcision methods are to be avoided. In 2012, Malaysian government health ministry proposed guidelines to reclassify and allow female circumcision as a medical practice.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced in Maldives. Maldives' Attorney General Husnu Suood claims FGM was eradicated from Maldives by the 1990s, but the practice of female circumcision in Maldives is reviving because of Islamic fatwas from religious scholars in Maldives who preach that it as compulsory. Religious leaders have renewed their calls for FGM in 2014.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced among some Pakistani communities, according to sources dated to the 1990s and 2000s. Gibeau reports, for example, FGM is widespread in Bohra Muslims of Pakistan. The Sheedi Muslim community of Pakistan, considered to be of Arab-African origins, practice FGM. The practice is also found in Muslim communities near Pakistan's Iran-Balochistan border.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is prevalent in parts of the Philippines. The communities that practice FGM call it \"Pag-Sunnat\", sometimes \"Pag-Islam\", and include Tausugs of Mindanao, Yakan of Basilan and other Muslim communities of Philippines. FGM is typically performed on girls between a few days old and age 8. Type IV FGM with complications has been reported.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced by the Malay Muslim community in Singapore.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practiced by the Muslim minority in Sri Lanka.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is practised by the Muslim population in the south of Thailand.\n\n\n\n"}

PET allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to and handled by services or applications. PET uses techniques to minimize possession of personal data without losing the functionality of an information system.\n\nThe objective of PETs is to protect personal data and ensure the users of technology that their information is confidential and management of data protection is a priority to the organizations who withhold responsibility for any PII - allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by, online service providers, merchants or other users.\n\nThe goal of privacy-enhancing technologies include increasing control over personal data sent to, and used by, online service providers and merchants (or other online users)(self-determination). PETs aim to minimize personal data collected and used by service providers and merchants, use pseudonyms or anonymous data credentials to provide anonymity, and strive to achieve informed consent about giving personal data to online service providers and merchants. In Privacy Negotiations, consumers and service providers establish, maintain, and refine privacy policies as individualized agreements through the ongoing choice among service alternatives, therefore providing the possibility to negotiate the terms and conditions of giving personal data to online service providers and merchants (data handling/privacy policy negotiation). Within private negotiations, the transaction partners may additionally bundle the personal information collection and processing schemes with monetary or non-monetary rewards.\n\nPETs provide the possibility to remotely audit the enforcement of these terms and conditions at the online service providers and merchants (assurance), allow users to log, archive and look up past transfers of their personal data, including what data has been transferred, when, to whom and under what conditions, and facilitate the use of their legal rights of data inspection, correction and deletion.\n\nExamples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are:\n\nExamples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed include limited disclosure technology, anonymous credentials such as online car rental, negotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions, and data transaction log. Limited disclosure technology provides a way of protecting individuals' privacy by allowing them to share only enough personal information with service providers to complete an interaction or transaction. This technology is also designed to limit tracking and correlation of users’ interactions with these third parties. Limited disclosure uses cryptographic techniques and allows users to retrieve data that is vetted by a provider, to transmit that data to a relying party, and have these relying parties trust the authenticity and integrity of the data. Anonymous credentials are asserted properties or rights of the credential holder that don't reveal the true identity of the holder; the only information revealed is what the holder of the credential is willing to disclose. The assertion can be issued by the user himself/herself, by the provider of the online service or by a third party (another service provider, a government agency, etc.). For example:\n\nOnline car rental. The car rental agency doesn't need to know the true identity of the customer. It only needs to make sure that the customer is over 23 (as an example), that the customer has a drivers license, health insurance (i.e. for accidents, etc.), and that the customer is paying. Thus there is no real need to know the customers name nor their address or any other personal information. Anonymous credentials allow both parties to be comfortable: they allow the customer to only reveal so much data which the car rental agency needs for providing its service (data minimization), and they allow the car rental agency to verify their requirements and get their money. When ordering a car online, the user, instead of providing the classical name, address and credit card number, provides the following credentials, all issued to pseudonyms (i.e. not to the real name of the customer):\nNegotiation and enforcement of data handling conditions. Before ordering a product or service online, the user and the online service provider or merchant negotiate the type of personal data that is to be transferred to the service provider. This includes the conditions that shall apply to the handling of the personal data, such as whether or not it may be sent to third parties (profile selling) and under what conditions (e.g. only while informing the user), or at what time in the future it shall be deleted (if at all). After the transfer of personal data took place, the agreed upon data handling conditions are technically enforced by the infrastructure of the service provider, which is capable of managing and processing and data handling obligations. Moreover, this enforcement can be remotely audited by the user, for example by verifying chains of certification based on Trusted computing modules or by verifying privacy seals/labels that were issued by third party auditing organisations (e.g. data protection agencies). Thus instead of the user having to rely on the mere promises of service providers not to abuse personal data, users will be more confident about the service provider adhering to the negotiated data handling conditions Lastly, the data transaction log allows users the ability to log the personal data they send to service provider(s), the time in which they do it, and under what conditions. These logs are stored and allow users to determine what data they have sent to whom, or they can establish the type of data that is in possession by a specific service provider. This leads to more transparency, which is a pre-requisite of being in control.\n\n\nPETs in general:\nAnonymous credentials:\nPrivacy policy negotiation:\n"}
{"id": "14551660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14551660", "title": "Religious stratification", "text": "Religious stratification\n\nReligious stratification is the division of a society into hierarchical layers on the basis of religious beliefs, affiliation, or faith practices. \n\nAccording to Kingsley Davis and Wilbert E. Moore, \"[t]he reason why religion is necessary is apparently to be found in the fact that human society achieves its unity primarily through the possession by its members of certain ultimate values and ends in common\". Furthermore, Davis and Moore contend that it is \"the role of religious belief and ritual to supply and reinforce this appearance of reality\" that these \"certain ultimate values\" have. This is one possible explanation for why religion is one of the underlying factors which links various forms of inequality into a chain of stratification.\n\nBroadly defined, social stratification is constituted by the division of a society into hierarchical layers of wealth, power, and prestige. These layers, or strata, have been related to a variety of social categories, such as:\n\n\nSociologists have paid attention to stratification based on race, class, gender, and ethnicity. Religion is closely tied to ethnic affiliation. Research suggests that religious stratification deserves more attention than it usually gets. It is a common development in religiously diverse societies. Once it becomes embedded in societies' laws, customs, and ideologies, it tends to persist. It also has societal consequences. Thus, it is important in its own right, but also in relation to other forms of stratification.\n\nSociologists James D. Davidson and Ralph E. Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification emerged during America's colonial period, as a result of religious ethnocentrism, religious competition, and unequal resources. They show that Anglicans, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians were over-represented among the economic, political, and educational elites. Other Protestant groups, Catholics, Jews, and people with no religious preference ranked much lower in status. \n\nThe ranking of religious groups has changed in some ways over the course of U.S. history (Davidson and Pyle 2011, Pyle 1996). Most notably, Jews have risen into the upper stratum, while Catholics have climbed into the upper-middle stratum. However, religious stratification persists. For example, Anglicans (now Episcopalians), Congregationalists (now United Church of Christ), and Presbyterians remain in the upper stratum, and other Protestants groups such as Baptists (who ranked low in the colonial period) still have not experienced much upward mobility. \n\nThese developments are linked to inter-religious power struggles related to membership size, organizational capacity, and resources. The struggles affect societal laws, ideologies, and customs. In the colonial period, religious stratification was justified by law: Congregationalists were the \"established\" church in New England colonies; Anglicans were the \"established\" church in southern colonies. The First and Fourteenth Amendments, along with other civil rights laws, have knocked the legal foundation out from under religious stratification. The pro-Protestant ideology that emerged in the colonial period has been tempered somewhat by multiculturalism, but it remains an integral part of American culture. Religious groups that have adapted most to this ideology have experienced more mobility than other groups. Colonial elites also have developed a number of customs, such as church-sponsored preparatory schools, private colleges, universities, and legacy admissions that have perpetuated their prominence (Coe and Davidson 2011). Another custom has been the tendency to appoint other religious elites to political office (Davidson, Kraus, and Morrissey 2005). Jews and Catholics have developed customs of their own, such as parochial schools and business ownership, that have contributed to improvements in their social status.\n\nContrary to Davis and Moore's argument that stratification is functional for society, Davidson and Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification destabilizes society. It produces social problems, like religious hate crimes, that would not otherwise exist.\n\nAccording to Evelyn L. Lehrer religion has a significant impact on marital stability, the choice of marital partner, fertility, women's work at home and in the labor market, education, wages and wealth, and the timing of entry into first union and the choice of whether to cohabit. In her research there are many instances in which stratification is the byproduct of religious faith practices. Stratification based on religion is evident specifically in the realm of economics.\nOne case in point is the presence of women in the work force. Lehrer explains \"The Mormon and conservative Protestant faiths make a sharp distinction between male and female social and economic roles, encouraging the traditional division of labor within the household when young children are present\" (713). Depending on the socioeconomic class of the family, the expectation of the woman to adhere to these traditional social roles could be a factor by which the economic advancement of the family is limited. \nCited within Lehrer's book are studies which examine levels of education, wages, and wealth among different religious faiths. Lehrer writes in her book, \"A conservative Protestant upbringing may be associated with an authoritarian approach to knowledge and a rejection of critical inquiry and unconventional modes of thinking, implying lower levels of certain types of home investments in child quality\" (716). This was derived from the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1999. Also based on the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1997, is Lehrer's assertion that conservative Protestant parents \"often discourage their children from taking college preparatory courses, out of a concern that such courses may be harmful to them\" (716). Lehrer, as a result, contends that children raised by conservative Protestant parents \"often acquire less human capital in their formative years and may thus be less able to benefit from college\" (716). So, as the topic is quite well developed, educational inequality is well researched and there is much evidence concerning the impact that an individual's level of education can have in terms of the hierarchy of stratification. It seems however that there can be seen another factor which should be allowed for in terms of determining the lines of stratification. Perhaps the significant impact that education plays in inequality can be even better understood when religion is controlled for. \n\nOther works which have investigated religious stratification include that of Gaetano Mosca whose research was published in his The Ruling Class. Although this work was published in the late 1930s the concept that is brought forth is interesting to note and is perhaps still quite relevant in contemporary times. Mosca states that \"In societies in which religious beliefs are strong and ministers of the faith form a special class a priestly aristocracy almost always arises and gains possession of a more or less important share of the wealth and the political power.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40543215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40543215", "title": "Rendezvous hashing", "text": "Rendezvous hashing\n\nRendezvous or highest random weight (HRW) hashing is an algorithm that allows clients to achieve distributed agreement on a set of \"k\" options out of a possible set of \"n\" options. A typical application is when clients need to agree on which sites (or proxies) objects are assigned to. When \"k\" is 1, it subsumes the goals of consistent hashing, using an entirely different method.\n\nRendezvous hashing was invented in 1996 by David Thaler and Chinya Ravishankar at the University of Michigan. Consistent hashing appears to have been devised around the same time at MIT. One of the first applications of rendezvous hashing was to enable multicast clients on the Internet (in contexts such as the MBONE) to identify multicast rendezvous points in a distributed fashion. It was used in 1998 by Microsoft's Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) for distributed cache coordination and routing. Some Protocol Independent Multicast routing protocols use rendezvous hashing to pick a rendezvous point.\n\nGiven its simplicity and generality, rendezvous hashing has been applied in a wide variety of applications, including mobile caching, router design, secure key establishment, and sharding and distributed databases.\n\nRendezvous hashing solves the distributed hash table problem: How can a set of clients, given an object \"O\", agree on where in a set of \"n\" sites (servers, say) to place \"O\"? Each client is to select a site independently, but all clients must end up picking the same site. This is non-trivial if we add a \"minimal disruption\" constraint, and require that only objects mapping to a removed site may be reassigned to other sites.\n\nThe basic idea is to give each site \"S\" a score (a \"weight\") for each object \"O\", and assign the object to the highest scoring site. All clients first agree on a hash function \"h()\". For object \"O\", the site \"S\" is defined to have weight \"w = h(O, S)\". HRW assigns \"O\" to the site \"S\" whose weight \"w\" is the largest. Since \"h()\" is agreed upon, each client can independently compute the weights \"w, w, ..., w\" and pick the largest. If the goal is distributed \"k\"-agreement, the clients can independently pick the sites with the \"k\" largest hash values.\n\nIf a site \"S\" is added or removed, only the objects mapping to \"S\" are remapped to different sites, satisfying the minimal disruption constraint above. The HRW assignment can be computed independently by any client, since it depends only on the identifiers for the set of sites \"S, S, ..., S\" and the object being assigned.\n\nHRW easily accommodates different capacities among sites. If site \"S\" has twice the capacity of the other sites, we simply represent \"S\" twice in the list, say, as \"S\" and \"S\". Clearly, twice as many objects will now map to \"S\" as to the other sites.\n\nIt might first appear sufficient to treat the \"n\" sites as buckets in a hash table and hash the object name \"O\" into this table. However, if any of the sites fails or is unreachable, the hash table size changes, requiring all objects to be remapped. This massive disruption makes such direct hashing unworkable. Under rendezvous hashing, however, clients handle site failures by picking the site that yields the next largest weight. Remapping is required only for objects currently mapped to the failed site, and as proved in, disruption is minimal. Rendezvous hashing has the following properties.\n\nConsistent hashing operates by mapping sites uniformly and randomly to points on a unit circle called tokens. Objects are also mapped to the unit circle and placed in the site whose token is the first encountered traveling clockwise from the object's location. When a site is removed, the objects it owns are transferred to the site owning the next token encountered moving clockwise. Provided each site is mapped to a large number (100-200, say) of tokens this will reassign objects in a relatively uniform fashion among the remaining sites.\n\nIf sites are mapped to points on the circle randomly by hashing 200 variants of the site ID, say, the assignment of any object requires storing or recalculating 200 hash values for each site. However, the tokens associated with a given site can be precomputed and stored in a sorted list, requiring only a single application of the hash function to the object, and a binary search to compute the assignment. Even with many tokens per site, however, the basic version of consistent hashing may not balance objects uniformly over sites, since when a site is removed each object assigned to it is distributed only over as many other sites as the site has tokens (say 100-200). Variants of consistent hashing (such as Amazon's Dynamo) that use more complex logic to distribute tokens on the unit circle offer better load balancing than basic consistent hashing, reduce the overhead of adding new sites, and reduce metadata overhead and offer other benefits. Such methods, however, are even more complex than basic consistent hashing.\n\nIn contrast, rendezvous hashing (HRW) is much simpler both conceptually and in practice. It also distributes objects uniformly over all sites, given a uniform hash function. Unlike consistent hashing, HRW requires no precomputing or storage of tokens. An object \"O\" is placed into one of \"n\" sites \"S, ..., S\" by computing the \"n\" hash values \"h(O,S)\" and picking the site \"S\" that yields the highest hash value. If a new site \"S\" is added, new object placements or requests will compute \"n+1\" hash values, and pick the largest of these. If an object already in the system at \"S\" maps to this new site \"S\", it will be fetched afresh and cached at \"S\". All clients will henceforth obtain it from this site, and the old cached copy at \"S\" will ultimately be replaced by the local cache management algorithm. If \"S\" is taken offline, its objects will be remapped uniformly to the remaining \"n-1\" sites.\n\nVariants of the HRW algorithm, such as the use of a skeleton (see below), can reduce the \"O(n)\" time for object location to \"O(log(n))\", at the cost of less global uniformity of placement. When \"n\" is not too large, however, the \"O(n)\" placement cost of basic HRW is not likely to be a problem. HRW completely avoids all the overhead and complexity associated with correctly handling multiple tokens for each site and associated metadata.\n\nRendezvous hashing also has the great advantage that it provides simple solutions to other important problems, such as distributed \"k\"-agreement.\n\nConsistent hashing can be reduced to an instance of HRW by an appropriate choice of a two-place hash function. From the site identifier formula_1 the simplest version of consistent hashing computes a list of token positions, e.g., formula_2 where formula_3 hashes values to locations on the unit circle. Define the two place hash function formula_4 to be formula_5 where formula_6 denotes the distance along the unit circle from formula_7 to formula_8 (since formula_6 has some minimal non-zero value there is no problem translating this value to a unique integer in some bounded range). This will duplicate exactly the assignment produced by consistent hashing.\n\nIt is not possible, however, to reduce HRW to consistent hashing (assuming the number of tokens per site is bounded), since HRW potentially reassigns the objects from a removed site to an unbounded number of other sites.\n\nImplementation is straightforward once a hash function \"h()\" is chosen (the original work on the HRW method makes a hash function recommendation). Each client only needs to compute a hash value for each of the \"n\" sites, and then pick the largest. This algorithm runs in \"O(n)\" time. If the hash function is efficient, the \"O(n)\" running time is not a problem, unless \"n\" is very large.\n\nIn the standard implementation of rendezvous hashing, every node receives a statically equal proportion of the keys. This behavior, however, is undesirable when the nodes have different capacities for processing or holding their assigned keys. For example, if one of the nodes had twice the storage capacity as the others, it would be beneficial if the algorithm could take this into account such that this more powerful node would receive twice the number of keys as each of the others.\n\nA straightforward mechanism to handle this case is to assign two virtual locations to this node, so that if either of that larger node's virtual locations has the highest hash, that node receives the key. But this strategy does not work when the relative weights are not integer multiples. For example, if one node had 42% more storage capacity, it would require adding many virtual nodes in different proportions, leading to greatly reduced performance. Several modifications to rendezvous hashing have been proposed to overcome this limitation.\n\nThe Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP) is a 1998 IETF draft that describes a method for computing \"load factors\" which can be multiplied by each node's hash score to yield an arbitrary level of precision for weighting nodes differently. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that when any node's weight is changed, or when any node is added or removed, all the load factors must be re-computed and relatively scaled. When the load factors change relative to one another, it triggers movement of keys between nodes whose weight was not changed, but whose load factor did change relative to other nodes in the system. This results in excess movement of keys.\n\nControlled replication under scalable hashing or CRUSH is an extension to RUSH that improves upon rendezvous hashing by constructing a tree where a pseudo-random function (hash) is used to navigate down the tree to find which node is ultimately responsible for a given key. It permits perfect stability for adding nodes however it is not perfectly stable when removing or re-weighting nodes, with the excess movement of keys being proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nThe CRUSH algorithm is used by the ceph data storage system to map data objects to the nodes responsible for storing them.\n\nIn 2005, Christian Schindelhauer and Gunnar Schomaker described a \"logarithmic method\" for re-weighting hash scores in a way that does not require relative scaling of load factors when a node's weight changes or when nodes are added or removed. This enables the dual benefits of perfect precision when weighting nodes, along with perfect stability—only a minimum number of keys must be remapped to new nodes upon any weight change.\n\nA similar logarithmic based hashing strategy is used to assign data to storage nodes in Cleversafe's data storage system, now IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nPython code implementing a weighted rendezvous hash:\n\nExample outputs of wrh:\n\nWhen \"n\" is extremely large, the following variant can improve running time. This approach creates a virtual hierarchical structure (called a \"skeleton\"), and achieves \"O(log n)\" running time by applying HRW at each level while descending the hierarchy. The idea is to first choose some constant \"m\" and organize the \"n\" sites into \"c =\" ceiling\"(n/m)\" clusters \"C = {S, S, ... ,S}, C = {S, S, ... ,S}, ...\" Next, build a virtual hierarchy by choosing a constant \"f\" and imagining these \"c\" clusters placed at the leaves of a tree \"T\" of virtual nodes, each with fanout \"f\".\n\nIn the accompanying diagram, the cluster size is \"m = 4\", and the skeleton fanout is \"f = 3\". Assuming 108 sites (real nodes) for convenience, we get a three-tier virtual hierarchy. Since \"f = 3\", each virtual node has a natural numbering in octal. Thus, the 27 virtual nodes at the lowest tier would be numbered 000, 001, 002, ..., 221, 222, in octal. (We can, of course, vary the fanout at each level. In that case, each node will be identified with the corresponding mixed-radix number.)\n\nInstead of applying HRW to all 108 real nodes, we can first apply HRW to the 27 lowest-tier virtual nodes, selecting one. We then apply HRW to the four real nodes in its cluster, and choose the winning site. We only need 27 + 4 = 31 hashes, rather than 108. If we apply this method starting one level higher in the hierarchy, we would need 9 + 3 + 4 = 16 hashes to get to the winning site. The figure shows how, if we proceed starting from the root of the skeleton, we may successively choose the virtual nodes (2), (20), and (200), and finally end up with site 74.\n\nWe can start at any level in the virtual hierarchy, not just at the root. Starting lower in the hierarchy requires more hashes, but may improve load distribution in the case of failures. Also, the virtual hierarchy need not be stored, but can be created on demand, since the virtual nodes names are simply prefixes of base-\"f\" (or mixed-radix) representations. We can easily create appropriately sorted strings from the digits, as required. In the example, we would be working with the strings 0, 1, 2 (at tier 1), 20, 21, 22 (at tier 2), and 200, 201, 202 (at tier 3). Clearly, \"T\" has height \"h = O (log c) = O (log n)\", since \"m\" and \"f\" are both constants. The work done at each level is \"O (1)\", since \"f\" is a constant.\n\nFor any given object \"O\", it is clear that the method chooses each cluster, and hence each of the \"n\" sites, with equal probability. If the site finally selected is unavailable, we can select a different site within the same cluster, in the usual manner. Alternatively, we could go up one or more tiers in the skeleton and select an alternate from among the sibling virtual nodes at that tier, and once again descend the hierarchy to the real nodes, as above.\n\nThe value of \"m\" can be chosen based upon such factors as the anticipated failure rate and the degree of load balancing desired. A higher value of \"m\" leads to less load skew in the event of failure, at the cost of somewhat higher search overhead.\n\nThe choice \"m = n\" is equivalent to non-hierarchical rendezvous hashing. In practice, the hash \"h()\" is very cheap, so \"m = n\" can work quite well unless \"n\" is very high.\n"}

{"id": "58875000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58875000", "title": "Scandinavian law", "text": "Scandinavian law\n\nScandinavian law, alternatively known as Nordic Law is the law of the five Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It is generally regarded as a subgroup of civil law or as an individual legal body in itself. Prior to the 19th century, the European countries were independent in their administering and legality. However, in 1872, the Nordic countries organised legislative cooperation. Especially in areas of contracts and commerce, as well as those concerned with family, nationality and extradition, the five states have obtained uniform legislation.\n\nPrior to the establishment of Scandinavian states in the 9th century, the numerous regions were independent in their administration and legal matters. Initially, the legal system had no written laws; rather, it consisted of customary law that was developed and reformed by the citizens themselves at meetings known as “things”. Customary laws were recorded in writing between the 11th and 13th centuries. These include, the Gulathing’s law (11th century, Norwegian); the law of Jutland (1241, Danish); and the laws of Uppland (1296, Swedish) and Götaland (13th century, Swedish).\n\nThe early laws were not formatted as they are in modern-day legal systems, rather they used codes. These included private law, namely criminal law, family law, succession, property law, contract law, constitutional and administrative law. Laws relating to the Church were usually treated separate to laws of the states and people. The codes represented customary laws and usually, foreign influences were neglected. Mutual with Germanic laws, the provincial laws abided by externalities and thus, were more advanced. King Magnus’ Swedish code (1350) abolished the concepts of vengeance, stating that the king’s officials should be the necessary authorities in administering criminal proceedings and hold punishment for those who went against the law. Further, presumably by influence of the Christian religion, the legal system was introduced for the benefit of peasants and the helpless class.\n\nAlthough in 1380 Norway and Denmark were ruled by a common king – Olav IV, the two states maintained laws separate to one another. Before the acquisition by Frederick III in 1660, supplementary laws were introduced. During the rule of Christain V, a thorough process of codification took place, with the earlier laws being replaced by Christain V’s Danish Law (1683) and Norwegian Law (1687). These new laws were predominantly based on the existing laws of the two counties with influences of Germanic and Roman laws being fairly minor. Similar to the earlier laws, these new laws consisted of both public and private law. At the time of their drafting, these codes read well and reflected individual human rights and the ideologies of equality. Further, in comparison to the laws of other European countries, the criminal law provisions were fair, humane and reflected individual rights. \n\nIn Sweden, the laws issued by King Christopher in 1442 were affirmed by Charles IX in 1608. However, following the Danish-Norwegian reforms, a royal commission was assembled to draft a modern new code. The result being, “the Law of 1734”, declared by Frederick I. Held by Sweden in the 13th century, Finland followed the Swedish law of 1734, which was translated in Finnish as “Law of the Realm of Finland”.\n\nIn most of the five Nordic States, the old codes have developed by parliamentary statutes. However, in Sweden, the law of 1734 is still regarded as a formal framework. In the other countries, codes are no longer of importance, rather, comprehensive codification of public and private law holds importance. \n\nWhile the historic codes still hold significance in Scandinavia today, the developments in modern Scandinavia has led to growth in Scandinavian civil law by way of statutes. Although the five Nordic countries follow similar legal theories, they have developed their own legal standards. Nonetheless, the countries follow an agreement to cooperate on legislative matters. \n\nSince 1872 when the agreement was entered into, the organised legislative cooperation in Scandinavian law has progressively increased in significance. As such, the Nordic states have achieved uniform legislation, in fields of contracts, commerce, family, nation and extradition. \n\nScandinavian legal systems adopted their civil law conceptions through the influence of law schools and commercial and corporations law are similar to European laws. Further, modern social welfare and human rights legislation has strong connections with the international laws. Scandinavian law, with a foundation of its customary laws, is pliable and less authoritarian than other European legal systems as it is relatively less restrictive. The laws focus greatly on rules, principles and precedents that have developed in practice, especially in courts. Further, most laws are judge-made, and as the principle of stare decisis does not apply, the courts are open to reflect the ever-changing social conditions.\n\nAlthough each Nordic state follows either a common or civil law system, it is proclaimed that these Scandinavian countries have adopted jurisprudence that falls neither in the civil law system nor the common law system.\n\nAll five of the Nordic states have their own respective Constitutions upon which their legislative framework is based upon. Whilst these Constitutions are all separate in nature, due to the legal cooperation between the Scandinavian states, the Constitutions are similar in their aims and contribute to the laws holistically.\n\nNorway’s legal system is a civil law system. Therefore, legislation is the predominant source of law, however not the sole one. According to legal scholar and author Torstein Eckhoff, there are seven sources of Norwegian law, including:\n\n1. Legislation;\n2. Legislative history;\n3. Case law;\n4. Administrative practice;\n5. Customary law;\n6. Legal literature; and\n7. Equity\n\nDue to the Nordic legal cooperation, this list is not exhaustive. Laws are informed and correspond to the other Scandinavian states. The three distinctive sections of Norwegian law are the Constitution, then ordinary statutes and followed by the regulations derived from statutes \nNorway adopted its Constitution in 1814 and holds the position of the second oldest hand-written Constitution in the world which is still in use. The Constitution consists of a set of Norwegian laws based upon the legal principles of sovereignty, the separation and division of powers and universal human rights. \n\nThe Constitution forms three distinctive branches of government, including:\n\n1. Legislative power vested in the Storting;\n2. Executive power vested in the King in Council, Regjeringen; and\n3. Judicial power vested in the Supreme Court, the subsidiary courts and in the Court of Impeachment.\n\nArticle 49 and 75 of the Constitution highlight the principles of sovereignty whereby it states that the people of Norway issue laws, make decisions regarding the states’ funds, impose taxes and supervise authorities, including the Government, by way of the Storting.\n\nStated within Article 3 of the Constitution, the executive power is held by the King, or the Queen. However, according to Article 27, Royal laws are adopted by the King in Council. Such laws are validated by the Prime Minister, the political leadership upon which the constitutional and senatorial responsibility is bestowed. \n\nPublished by the Faculty of Law in Oslo and Fagbokforlaget, Norges Lover Norway’s most comprehensive code of law. It consists of one volume published annually and used by law students, legal professional and officers of the court. The code contains the Constitution, legislation in force, adopted legislation yet to take effect and also pre-1814 legislation which is still valid and in force. \n\nAs the Storting only passes entirely new Acts and abolishes the old Acts, amendments to legislation are integrated in the existing statutes. The Norges Lover follows a chronological order by date of enactment, excluding the Constitution, which is placed at the front of the code.\n\nSwedish law is a civil law system manifested on statutory laws. \n\nSweden’s Constitution consists of the four “fundamental laws”, consisting of:\n\n1. The Instrument of Government (1974);\n2. The Act of Succession (1810);\n3. The Freedom of the Press Act (1949); and\n4. The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991)\n\nFurther to the above, there is also the Riksdag Act which translates to the Parliament Act (1974), however this is not classified as a law fundamental to the state. \n\nThe fundamental laws take precedence over all other laws. The written Constitution regulates the Riksdag – the Swedish Parliament, the appointing of Government officials and it sets out the key ways in which Sweden’s authorities shall function. \n\nThe Swedish Code of Statutes is Sweden’s official compilation of all laws enacted by the Riksdag and regulations issued by the Government. \n\nThis Code is enacted into statutory law, however it forms its own unified legal code containing all of the laws passed by the Government, including civil and criminal law, procedure, regulations, legal information and all other legal articles pertinent to Sweden. Although Sweden follows a civil law system, this Code of Statutes combines both statutory and civil law. The Code is amended frequently and amendments are integrated to the existing statutes. Similar to Norway, Sweden’s Constitution is placed at the front of its Code of Statutes.\n\nFinnish laws and legal traditions are influenced by Swedish law and holistically also the Scandinavian and German legal families. Based on civil law tradition, the law of Finland consists mostly of statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Finland. Finland’s Constitution takes supreme authority and sets out the procedures and guidelines for the application of legislation. Similar to other civil law systems, judicial decisions are generally not authoritative in nature and there is often not many judge-made laws. Further, Supreme Court decisions may be cited, however they are not actually binding. \n\nBeing a member of the European Union, Finland enacts many European Union laws and implements the European Union directives in its national laws. \nFinland’s Constitution came into force in 2000 and aims to regulate legislation and the manner in which government power is exercised. It specifies the primary rules, values and principles of the Finnish government and democracy. Furthermore, it details the significance of the relationship between the citizen and the government. In relation to the government, the Constitution governs the use of government power, the government organisation and the authorities and organs of the government.\n\nThe Danish legal system is a combination of public and civil law. This mix of law suggests that Danish law focuses on societal interests and also that the states organs are vested with greater authority than the courts in applying legal frameworks. \n\nThe legal system primarily consists of statutory regulation, principles and laws. Similar to the other Nordic states, although the courts have authority to create laws, the statutory law is supplemented by customary law and case law. Alike all other Scandinavian countries, the Constitution of Denmark is at the top of the legal hierarchy.\n\nAdopted in 1953, the principle aim of Denmark’s Constitution was to abolish monarchy by limiting the King’s power and introduce a system of democracy. It establishes the framework for governance by way of structure, procedure, power and the duties bestowed on the Danish Parliament. \n\nThe Danish Parliament known is not permitted to make laws which may invalidate or contradict the Constitutional Act. Although Denmark does not have a court to try constitutional matters, laws can be declared unconstitutional and void by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Denmark. \n\nIceland has a civil law system and therefore its main sources of law include the Constitution, statutory legislation and regulatory statutes. Complementing sources include precedent and customary laws followed by Scandinavia. \n\nThe most recent Constitution of Iceland is of 1999. It is regarded as the supreme law of Iceland and highlights the leadership structures of the country and preserves the human rights of its citizens.\n\nApart from the Constitution from which it is influenced and regulated, legislation in Iceland takes primacy as a source of law. The increasing propensity of social, economic and political trends has resulted in a greater significance of laws by way of new general acts targeting niche sectors such as customs, respect of children, banking, communication and corporations’ laws. \n\nThe Stockholm Institute for Scandinavian Law (SISL) proclaims that as all of the Nordic states follow the civil law system, Scandinavian law as a whole should be classified as civil law as opposed to common law. Due to the fact that common law has taken little precedence in the development of law in the Nordic countries and additionally that all legal concepts presently adopted in Scandinavian law have been derived from the civil Germanic law, the SISL views Scandinavian law as a civil law system.\n"}

It is primarily used by the Serbs of Croatia. The Croatian Constitution, Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights, Law on Education in language and script of national minorities and Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities define the public co-official usage of Serbian in Croatia. Serbian and Croatian are two standardized varieties of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language. Majority of Serbs of Croatia use Ijekavian pronunciation of Proto-Slavic vowel jat except in the Podunavlje region in Vukovar-Srijem and Osijek-Baranja Counties where local Serb population use Ekavian pronunciation. Post-World War II and Croatian War of Independence settlers in Podunavlje which have come from Bosnia, Dalmatia or Western Slavonia either use their original Ijekavian pronunciation, adopted Ekavian pronunciation or both of them depending on context. In 2011 Census majority of Serbs of Croatia declared Croatian standardized variety as their first language with Ijekavian pronunciation always being required standard form in Croatian. While Serbian variety recognizes both pronunciations as standard Ekavian is the more common one as it is the dominant one in Serbia, with Ijekavian being mostly limited to Republika Srpska in Bosnia, Montenegro and Croatia.\n\nThe Orthodox liturgical book Varaždin Apostol from 1454 represents the oldest preserved text in Cyrillic from the territory of today's Croatia. Croatian Constitutional law on national minorities rights, one of only two constitutional laws in country, entered into force on 23 December 2002.\n\nIn April 2015 the United Nations Human Rights Committee urged the Croatian government to ensure the right of minorities to use their language and alphabet. The report noted the use of Serbian Cyrillic in Vukovar and municipalities concerned. Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dačić said that his country welcomes the UN Human Rights Committee's report.\n\nMost schools with instruction in Serbian are located in Vukovar-Srijem and Osijek-Baranja County in the area of former Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia where rights on education in minority languages were provided during the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium based on the Erdut Agreement. Today with those schools there is also Kantakuzina Katarina Branković Serbian Orthodox Secondary School in Zagreb.\n\nIn the school year 2010-2011, 3.742 students attended kindergartens, primary and secondary schools in Serbian. 59 educational institutions offered Serbian language education that year and 561 educators and teachers worked in them. In school year 2011-2012 the total number of students was 4.059 in 63 educational institutions and 563 educators and teachers worked in them. Number of classes or groups in this period increased from 322 to 353.\n\nAs a chair at the Department of South Slavic languages, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Zagreb has a The Chair of Serbian and Montenegrin literature. Among the others, lecturers of Serbian literature at the university over the time included Antun Barac, Đuro Šurmin and Armin Pavić.\n\nVarious minority organizations use Serbian in their work. One of them, Association for Serbian language and literature in Croatia from Vukovar is a nonprofit professional organization that brings together scientists and technical workers in the Republic of Croatia engaged in studying and teaching of Serbian language and literature.\n\nThe Law on Use of Languages and Scripts of National Minorities provides for a mandatory co-official use of minority languages in municipalities of Croatia with at least one third of members of ethnic minoritiy. Municipalities Dvor, Gvozd, Jagodnjak, Šodolovci, Borovo, Trpinja, Markušica, Negoslavci, Biskupija, Ervenik, Kistanje, Gračac, Udbina, Vrbovsko, Donji Kukuruzari, Erdut and Vukovar, according to the provisions of law, are obliged to grant equal co-official use of Serbian language and Serbian Cyrillic alphabet. Law enforcement is facing great resistance in the part of the majority population, most notably in the case of Vukovar where it led to 2013 Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia.\n\n"}
{"id": "3791975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3791975", "title": "Social role valorization", "text": "Social role valorization\n\nIn psychology, education and social work practice, social role valorization (SRV) is the name given to an analysis of human relationships and human services, formulated in 1983 by Wolf Wolfensberger, as the successor to his earlier formulation of the principle of normalization which is attributed to Nirje, Wolfensberger, and Bank-Mikkelsen worldwide (Lemay, 1995; Wolfensberger, 1972). The theory is based on the idea that society tends to identify groups of people as fundamentally 'different', and of less value than everyone else. It catalogs the methods of this 'devaluation' and analyzes its effects. It may be used by those seeking to counteract these methods and effects. A recent compilation of normalization and social role valorization was by Flynn and LeMay (1999); their work remains important today in Europe, New Zealand and Australia among other countries.\n\nAlthough normalization and the initial versions of SRV were described as an 'Ideology', the most recent formulation explicitly denies that SRV is about what \"should\" be done, and reinforces that SRV is intended to be a tool for analysis of the process and effects of Societal Devaluation. Wolfensberger's most recent (1999) definition of SRV is: \"the application of what science can tell us about the enablement, establishment, enhancement, maintenance, and/or defence of valued social roles for people\" (Susan Thomas and Wolf Wolfensberger in Flynn and Lemay 1999, p. 125). Susan Thomas, long time professional educator with Wolfensberger, continues to teach through the Institute at Syracuse University as of 2012. University students and training institute colleagues can be found worldwide with many internationally seeking collaborative projects with the Wolfensberger (e.g., now Rannveig Traustadottir, now Gender and Disability Chair at the University of Iceland).\n\nSocial role valorization (SRV) is a relationship theory of empirical knowledge for the design and rendering of formal and informal services and relationships to people with any need or condition, especially those who are devalued or are at risk. Social role valorization is intended to address the social and psychological wounds that are inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on those who are close to them.\n\nSRV does not in itself propose a 'goal'. However a person who has a goal of improving the lives of devalued people may choose to use insights gained from SRV to cause change. They may do so by attempting to create or support socially valued roles for people in their society, because if a person holds valued social roles, a person is highly likely to receive from society those good things in life that are available or at least the opportunities for obtaining them. In other words, all sorts of good things that other people are able to convey are almost automatically apt to be accorded to a person who holds societally valued roles, at least within the resources and norms of his/her society.\n\nSocial role valorization identifies social devaluation as a critical human experience that has long-term effects on the individual. SRV is designed to raise consciousness about the fate of socially devalued persons. SRV holds that the human being is vulnerable to the regard of others for both the heights of edification and the depths of degradation.\n\nAn understanding of social role valorization can lead to ideas about how to improve the lives of people who are devalued by society. These can be seen to have two themes – firstly, removing devaluing features (for instance people being segregated from society in a building along with others perceived to belong to the same group), and secondly taking action that leads to people being valued. On one the approaches of SRV involves socially valued persons allying themselves with socially devalued persons. This alliance will unify people, broaden acceptance of differences, and encourage coexistence.\n\nSRV is a realistic if not pessimistic sense of human behaviour, holding that human beings are imperfect and capable of great evils even if they are occasionally saintly, heroic or kind.\n\nSocial role valorization is designed to address the social and psychological wounds that get inflicted on vulnerable people because they are devalued, that so often come to define their lives, and that in some instances wreak lifelong havoc on them and those who are close and committed to them.\n\nSRV is a description of how societally differentiated people are devalued, assigned low-value roles, and treated poorly, often to the extent of risk to their own lives. This poor treatment is given to members of any group that is given low value by powerful forces in society.\n\nSRV considers only those things that can be known from a scientific perspective. In itself it does not subscribe to a particular ideology – it does not say what should be done and it does not say what is morally correct.\n\nHowever, SRV does understand that human interaction is impossible without a moral code and so SRV can be used to suggest what is desirable given the spoken or unspoken moral code of a particular society or individual. Consequently, it is necessary to understand what sort of moral code and societal expectations might be around the implementation of any application of SRV. A consideration of the concepts of humanity and morality place SRV in an appropriate context.\n\nAny particular human society will have a set of written and unwritten rules about who is a member of that society and about how members of that society should act, and what treatment is due to non-members of that society. These rules are often set down in codes of law and in religious texts. Every society has such a moral code.\n\nSupport for SRV can be found throughout the human sciences. Biology, evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology all lend strands to SRV. Even history and geography have ideas to contribute. Although SRV is not in itself a science, it is based on empirically produced disciplines.\n\nPsychology and philosophy tell us that there is considerable doubt about the common sense idea that we have total free will; what we do is often societally or physically caused by unconscious mechanisms.\n\nScience tells us that people do not often act as completely free-thinking individuals, but in fact occupy particular social strata and roles that organize and simplify their social communication. Particular people may be forced into a negative role which they do not desire.\n\nScience tells us that individuals and groups will place positive and negative values onto other individuals and groups. This assignation of value may lead to a process of devaluation.\n\nComplex societal forces mediate the exercise of power and social control in a society. These forces are often not well understood by individuals in that society.\n\nIndividuals in a society are very aware of similarities and differences between members of that society. This is societal differentiation.\n\nSuch difference groups may include people with the following differences from the valued norm:\n\nPsychology shows us that perception and interpretation are complex subjects, highly reliant on beliefs and prejudices. Human perception and interpretation is complicated and often not in accord with what 'common sense' tells us that it is.\n\nLearning and particularly imitation are the natural modes of behavior formation and are important in developing useful as well as damaging performances.\n\nImage and image transfer are important subjects when considering how people interpret each other and their own surroundings.\n\nPerformance, reputation and grouping determine how people are seen and interpreted.\n\nSo, we may summarise: people who differ in any way from societal expectations or desirability, where this difference is negatively valued, will be badly treated by that society.\n\nPowerful groups in society will:\n\n\nSRV suggests that role messages are largely conveyed by image, whether of the individual or of their surroundings (including accompanying people). A person's potential roles may be limited or assigned by the company they keep, the surroundings in which they live, or the activities they engage in.\n\nSRV suggests that Role Occupancy is dependent on apparent competency in that role. So the availability of roles may be limited or assigned by the person's ability (or, more importantly, the lack of ability) to perform the necessary role requirements for the effective performance of that role.\n\nPeople cast into such negative roles will be denied the good things in life:\n\nThe good things in life:\n\nFurther, such groups will be damaged in the following ways:\n\n'Wounds' or bad things which happen to devalued persons:\n\n\nAdditional mental and behavioral response patterns that are evidence of disturbed interactions with the world, and that are engendered by certain wounds and wound clusters, are:\n\n\nThe coping mechanism is to avoid negative roles and outcomes:\n\nIn order to ensure that positive roles are available to persons who have been devalued by society, it is necessary to consider actions at multiple levels:\n\n\nSRV suggests that by these means, people who have been devalued by society may be rescued (or may rescue themselves) from the effects of devaluation, and may manage to live their lives occupying Valued Roles and become seen as valued by society. Other theories regarding \"mentally handicapped\" individuals include consciousness raising and implications for normalization from the women's movement, related self-advocacy movements in special education and rehabilitation, and now the new movement to community inclusion as represented at the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006).\n\nThis criticism appears unjust in that Wolfensberger is an early proponent of the rights of people with mental retardation to marry, while other professionals placed the same individuals in institutional abuse and confinement. His doctoral students hold leadership positions in gender and disability, and he is associated with liberals in his own academic department who support actions in that context to address entrenched societal discrimination.\nIt can be suggested that all constructed attempts to re-valorize the roles and raise the social status of marginalised individuals and groups are hollow as they are artificial, but of course, government is responsible to provide minimum wage laws, to increase worker benefits, to maintain entitlements, to provide quality housing and beneficial and affordable health care. \nIn other words, the person providing the re-valorization efforts such as a social worker or supported employment worker is paid to do his or her job, and is not helping the marginalised person out of genuine interpersonal motivation such as friendship, attraction or emotional attachment, and people are well aware of this monetary role in professions in human services. Therefore, any re-valorized role is viewed by those outside the relationship as non-genuine, unstable, though new evidence and theory (e.g., theories of social acceptance, versus deviance) suggests that beneficence and social acceptance are active and result in positive life outcomes. Thus, paid roles (sometimes preferred in modern life) would tend to negate the security-giving benefits that valued, familial and friendship roles would normally provide.\n\nSome criticism of social role valorization is said by its advocates to be because of misconceptions about it. Such misconceptions include:\n\nThe theory of social role valorization is best understood as referring primarily to extreme devaluation (such that few people care much about what happens to an individual or group, or even actively look for their eradication) not more subtle (but still damaging) devaluation such as occurs between different social classes or between genders.\n\nSocial role valorization (SRV), similar to normalization, is a foundational theory with roots in intellectual and developmental disabilities, often termed learning disabilities in Europe. It is a revolutionary concept which took roots in the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements of the 1970s and 1980s which aligned themselves with its broad concepts and goals more so than with the specifics of the theory, goals and formulations itself. SRV and normalization adherents, in contrast, are committed first to the specific theories and have tended to be reluctant to engage in academic theoretical discussions with related theorists (e.g., independent and supportive living; support and empowerment paradigms; user-and-family directed services; self-determination and choice theories). In addition, other giants in community development such as Gunnar Dybwad, advisors to Presidents in the US, Brandeis University professor, friend of the Center on Human Policy, and former Arc-US director, often are missed in contrasting theory formulations.\n\nSRV is supportive of the development of community paradigms (e.g., Schwartz, McKnight, O'Brien, Taylor, Racino, Wehman, Roberts, Towell, Lakin, Bruininks, Braddock, Hemp, Rogan, Anthony, Carling, Seekins, Condeluci & Gretz-Lasky) which were necessary to replace the institutional paradigms of the pre-expose era, however, with community paradigms taking over 20 years to become the mainstream academic publications. Today, new goals of integration, a basic principle of normalization, involve the integration of family studies to include families with a disability family member, integration of financing (e.g., housing and homes), long-term services and supports development (e.g., personal assistance, support aides for homes and families), and modernization to areas such as green and sustainability.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53884873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53884873", "title": "Stanley Pearl", "text": "Stanley Pearl\n\nAustralian Stanley Keith Pearl was a sapper with the First Australian Imperial Force during World War I. His exact dates of birth and death are unclear. After enlisting at the town of Ulverstone in Tasmania on 9 November 1915 at twenty-one years of age, Pearl, in August 1916, became a sapper with the Australian 5 Field Company Engineers. He performed this role for the duration of the war. Many details on Pearl himself remain a mystery. A consideration of the phenomenal trench art collection that he produced, however, helps to piece together essential information about him.\n\nPearl was a joiner by trade whose father was Charles Pearl of Ulverstone, Tasmania. Pearl was Anglican. He embarked from Sydney to Alexandria and then the Western Front (World War I) in France aboard HMAT \"Orsova\" on 11 March 1916. He undertook a brief stint with the 8 Field Company Engineers (Reinforcement 4) before joining the 5 Field Company Engineers. Pearl’s Victory Medal (United Kingdom) and British War Medal are held in the Australian War Memorial’s collection.\n\nPearl produced a phenomenal collection of trench art between 1916 and 1919. Pearl donated his trench art objects to the Australian War Memorial but whether this reflects the full extent of that which he produced in the context of war remains a mystery. A total of fifteen of Pearl’s oeuvre are held in the Australian War Memorial’s Military Heraldry collection. Military shell cases, other parts of shells, badges and buttons were just some of the war-related materials used by Pearl to assemble everyday objects such as a clock, a map of Tasmania and a hat pin stand, as is evidenced by the accessibility and digitisation of his work on the War Memorial’s online collection (see external links for selection of images). One can become more familiar with Pearl’s work through such a collection as it displays images of the objects together with Pearl’s own field notes. The accompanying field notes that Pearl documented alongside each piece are fascinating as this was not a feature typically associated with First World War trench art. Pearl used matter-of-fact language where tales of death became mere descriptions. Pearl’s field notes and his details on the First World War embarkation roll are useful additional primary sources for historians, art historians and anthropologists.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Pearl is survived by anyone, nor have any photographs of him been discovered. He is an \"enigma.\" It is therefore Pearl’s material existence in the form of trench art that survives, the power of which is subsequently elevated. The creative and artistic vision of Pearl to contribute to the material culture of World War I, of which trench art is a fascinating example, has meant that his name lives on through these well-crafted, striking objects. Pearl was unconsciously engaging with features of material culture such as bricolage and recyclia in producing trench art. The fact that he was a joiner pre-war also speaks to this refined, craftsmanship-like quality to his pieces.\n\nPearl survived World War I. During March of 1919, Pearl returned to Tasmania, although soon relocated to Canberra. He began working for the Australian War Memorial in 1941, the year that it opened, and continued to do so until he retired. He worked as a carpenter and senior tradesman at the War Memorial. The electoral roll details Pearl’s exact position at the War Memorial as an ‘installation manager.’ Such hands-on employment echoes his pre-war occupation as a joiner.\n\nA recent exhibition entitled \"Sappers & Shrapnel: Contemporary Art and the Art of the Trenches\" at the Art Gallery of South Australia showcased Pearl’s trench art. The exhibition presented Pearl’s pieces alongside other First World War trench art objects and more recent works of art that reflected on war today. Such a display, in bringing together the historical and the contemporary, was the first opportunity whereby the trench art of Pearl was exposed to a wider audience. It is evidence that Pearl and his trench art collection hold an important relevance today and will continue to do so in the future, especially in studies of history, art history and anthropology.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19186813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19186813", "title": "Stoning", "text": "Stoning\n\nStoning, or lapidation, is a method of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until the subject dies. No individual among the group can be identified as the one who kills the subject. This is in contrast to the case of a judicial executioner. Often slower than other forms of execution, stoning within the context of contemporary Western culture is considered a form of execution by torture.\n\nStoning is called \"rajm\" (Arabic: ) in Islamic literature, and is a legal or customary punishment found in the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Qatar, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, northern Nigeria, Aceh Province of Indonesia, Afghanistan, and tribal parts of Pakistan, including northwest Kurram Valley and the northwest Khwezai-Baezai region. In some countries, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, stoning has been declared illegal by the state, but is practiced extrajudicially. In several others, people have been sentenced to death by stoning, but the sentence has not been carried out. In modern times, allegations of stoning are politically sensitive; the government of Iran, for example, describes allegations of stoning as political propaganda.\n\nThe Jewish Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) serves as a common religious reference for Judaism. Stoning is the method of execution mentioned most frequently in the Torah. (Murder is not mentioned as an offense punishable by stoning, but it seems that a member of the victim's family was allowed to kill the murderer; see avenger of blood.) The crimes punishable by stoning were the following:\n\n\nDescribing the stoning of those who entice others to apostates from Judaism, the Torah states:\nA case noted in the Bible, not falling into any of the above categories, was that of Achan, stoned to death together with his sheep, other livestock and his children for having pillaged valuables from Jericho during Joshua's Conquest of Canaan.\n\nThe Talmud describes four methods of execution: stoning, pouring molten lead down the throat of the condemned person, beheading, and strangulation (see Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism). The Mishna gives the following list of persons who should be stoned.\n\n\"To the following sinners stoning applies – אלו הן הנסקלין\n\nAs God alone was deemed to be the only arbiter in the use of capital punishment, not fallible people, the Sanhedrin made stoning a hypothetical upper limit on the severity of punishment.\n\nPrior to early Christianity, particularly in the Mishnah, doubts were growing in Jewish society about the effectiveness of capital punishment in general (and stoning in particular) in acting as a useful deterrent. Subsequently, its use was dissuaded by the central legislators. The Mishnah states:\n\nA Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says that this extends to a Sanhedrin that puts a man to death even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: Had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel.\n\nIn the following centuries the leading Jewish sages imposed so many restrictions on the implementation of capital punishment as to make it \"de facto\" illegal. The restrictions were to prevent execution of the innocent, and included many conditions for a testimony to be admissible that were difficult to fulfill.\n\nPhilosopher Moses Maimonides wrote, \"It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.\" He was concerned that the law guard its public perception, to preserve its majesty and retain the people's respect. He saw errors of commission as much more threatening to the integrity of law than errors of omission.\n\nIn rabbinic law, capital punishment may only be inflicted by the verdict of a regularly constituted court of twenty-three qualified members. There must be the most trustworthy and convincing testimony of at least two qualified eyewitnesses to the crime, who must also depose that the culprit had been forewarned of the criminality and the consequences of his project. The culprit must be a person of legal age and of sound mind, and the crime must be proved to have been committed of the culprit's free will and without the aid of others.\n\nOn the day the verdict is pronounced, the convict is led forth to execution. The Torah law (Leviticus 19:18) prescribes, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\"; and the Rabbis maintain that this love must be extended beyond the limits of social intercourse in life, and applied even to the convicted criminal who, \"though a sinner, is still thy brother\" (Mak. 3:15; Sanh. 44a): \"The spirit of love must be manifested by according him a decent death\" (Sanh. 45a, 52a). Torah law provides (Deut. 24:16), \"The parents shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the parents; every man shall be put to death for his own sins\", and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. A sentence is not attended by confiscation of the convict's goods; the person's possessions descend to their legal heirs.\n\nThe Talmud limits the use of the death penalty to Jewish criminals who:\n\n\nIn theory, the Talmudic method of how stoning is to be carried out differs from mob stoning. According to the Jewish oral law, after the Jewish criminal has been determined as guilty before the Great Sanhedrin, the two valid witnesses and the sentenced criminal go to the edge of a two-story building. From there the two witnesses are to push the criminal off the roof of a two-story building. The two-story height is chosen as this height is estimated by the Talmud to effect a quick and painless demise but is not so high that the body will become dismembered. After the criminal has fallen, the two witnesses are to drop a large boulder onto the criminal – requiring both of the witnesses to lift the boulder together. If the criminal did not die from the fall or from the crushing of the large boulder, then any people in the surrounding area are to quickly cause him to die by stoning with whatever rocks they can find.\n\nIslamic sharia law is based on the Quran and the hadith as primary sources.\n\nThe Qur'an does not mention the act of stoning (Rajm) for any crime.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the punishment for Adultery (Zina) in the Quran is not stoning to death but flogging with a 100 lashes (if the accuser can provide 4 witnesses to the act). If the accuser cannot produce 4 witnesses, he himself will be punished by flogging with 80 lashes. \n\nHadith refers to orally transmitted reports of statements or actions attributed to Muhammad. It was forbidden to record any Hadith on paper by Muhammad himself, the first 4 righteous Caliphs after the death of Muhammed and the later Caliphs. They believed the Quran was clear, fully detailed, complete, perfect and sufficient. There were fears that people would confuse hadith with the Qur'an, influence would seep in from other creeds, fear for fabrications by heretics,for personal or political gain. The first Hadith (that have survived) were recorded 200 years after the prophets death. There were tens of thousands Muhaddiths who had each memorised at least 400,000 narrations along with the chain of narrators for each narration. Out of the hundreds of thousands of Hadith only a very, very small percentage were declared authentic (Sahih) by Hadith Scholars. Hadith Scholars used a number of methods of evaluation to determine the veracity of the recorded oral reports. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, the individual narrators involved in its transmission and cross-referincing the reports.\n\nMuslims vary in degrees of acceptance of the Hadith. To many Sunnite and Shiite Muslims (different collections of) the hadith are almost on par with the Quran itself. To others the Quran is the word of Allah but the Hadith are the words and deeds of a human (the prophet Muhammed) transmitted down by the 200 years old fallible memory of men. Useful but not completely reliable. Some Muslims give little to no credence to the Hadith. Then there are also the different sets of Hadith accepted by different branches of Islam (Temporary Marriage or Female Genital Mutilation) who consider each other's Hadith fake.\n\nStoning in the Sunnah mainly follows on the Jewish stoning rules of the Torah. A few hadiths refer to Muhammad ordering the stoning of a married Jewish man and a married woman committing an illegal sexual act after consulting the Torah.\n\nIn a few others, a Bedouin man is lashed, while a Jewish woman is stoned to death, for having sex outside marriage.\n\nStoning is described as punishment in multiple hadiths. Shia and Sunni hadith collections differ because scholars from the two traditions differ as to the reliability of the narrators and transmitters and the Imamah. Shi'a sayings related to stoning can be found in Kitab al-Kafi, and Sunni sayings related to stoning can be found in the Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Based on these hadiths, in some Muslim countries, married adulterers are sentenced to death, while consensual sex between unmarried people results in 100 lashes.\n\nHadiths describe stoning as punishment under sharia. In others stoning is prescribed as punishment for illegal sex between man and woman, illegal sex by a slave girl, as well as anyone involved in any homosexual relations. In some sunnah, the method of stoning, by first digging a pit and partly burying the person's lower half in it, is described.\n\nStoning (Arabic: رجم \"Rajm\", sometimes spelled as \"Rajam\") has been extensively discussed in the texts of early, medieval and modern era Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh).\n\nAccording to traditional jurisprudence, zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, bestiality, and rape. Classification of homosexual intercourse as zina differs according to legal school. Although stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of hadith that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is \"muhsan\" (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later. The Maliki legal school also allows an unmarried woman's pregnancy to be used as evidence, but the punishment can be averted by a number of legal \"semblances\" (\"shubuhat\"), such as existence of an invalid marriage contract. These requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice. Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called \"qadhf\" (القذف), which is itself a \"hadd\" crime liable to a punishment of 80 lashes and to be unacceptable as witnesses unless they repent and reform.\n\nAccording to the Islamic concept of \"Li'an\", the testimony of a man who accuses his own wife without any other witnesses may be accepted if he swears by God four times that he is telling the truth with a fifth oath to incur God's condemnation if they be lying. In this case, if his wife counter swears, no punishment will be enforced.\nOne of the widely followed Islamic legal commentaries, \"Al-Muwatta\" by Malik ibn Anas, state that contested pregnancy is sufficient proof of adultery and the woman must be stoned to death.\n\nHanafi jurists have held that the accused must be a \"muhsan\" at the time of religiously disallowed sex, to be punished by \"Rajm\" (stoning). A \"Muhsan\" is an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony, regardless of whether the marriage still exists. In other words, stoning does not apply to someone who was never married in his or her life (only lashing in public is the mandatory punishment in such cases).\n\nFor evidence, Hanafi fiqh accepts the following: self-confession, or testimony of four male witnesses (female witness is not acceptable). Hanafi Islamic law literature specifies two types of stoning. One, when the punishment is based on \"bayyina\", or concrete evidence (four male witnesses). In this case the person is bound, a pit dug, the bound person placed and partially buried inside the pit so that he or she may not escape, thereafter the public stoning punishment is executed. A woman sentenced to stoning must be partially buried up to her chest. The first stones are thrown by the witnesses and the accuser, thereafter the Muslim community present, stated Abū Ḥanīfa and other Hanafi scholars. In second type of stoning, when the punishment is based on self-confession, the stoning is to be performed without digging a pit or partially burying the person. In this case, the qadi (judge) should throw the first stone before other Muslims join in. Further, if the person flees, the person is allowed to leave.\n\nHanafi scholars specify the stone size to be used for \"Rajm\", to be the size of one's hand. It should not be too large to cause death too quickly, nor too small to extend only pain.\n\nHanafis have traditionally held that the witnesses should throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by witnesses, and the \"qadi\" must throw the first stones in case the conviction was brought about by a confession.\n\nThe Shafii school literature has the same Islamic law analysis as the Hanafi. However, it recommends, that the first stone be thrown by the Imam or his deputy in all cases, followed by the Muslim community witnessing the stoning punishment.\n\nHanbali jurist Ibn Qudamah states, \"Muslim jurists are unanimous on the fact that stoning to death is a specified punishment for the married adulterer and adulteress. The punishment is recorded in number of traditions and the practice of Muhammad stands as an authentic source supporting it. This is the view held by all Companions, Successors and other Muslim scholars with the exception of Kharijites.\"\n\nHanbali Islamic law sentences all forms of consensual but religiously illegal sex as punishable with \"Rajm\".\n\nMaliki school of jurisprudence (fiqh) holds that stoning is the required punishment for illegal sex by a married or widowed person, as well as for any form of homosexual relations among men. Malik ibn Anas, founded of Maliki fiqh, considered pregnancy in an unmarried woman as a conclusive proof of zina. He also stated that contested pregnancy is also sufficient proof of adultery and any Muslim woman who is pregnant by a man who she is not married to, at the time of getting pregnant, must be stoned to death. Later Maliki Muslim scholars admitted the concept of \"sleeping embryo\", where a divorced woman could escape the stoning punishment, if she remained unmarried and became pregnant anytime within five years of her divorce, and it was assumed that she was impregnated by her previous husband but the embryo remained dormant for five years.\n\nStoning appears to have been practiced by the Aztecs.\nAs of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Yemen and some predominantly Muslim states in northern Nigeria as punishment for Zina (\"adultery by married persons\").\n\nStoning is illegal in Afghanistan, but is sometimes carried out by tribal leaders and Taliban insurgents extrajudicially in certain parts of the country. Before the Taliban government, most areas of Afghanistan, aside from the capital, Kabul, were controlled by warlords or tribal leaders. The Afghan legal system depended highly on an individual community's local culture and the political or religious ideology of its leaders. Stoning also occurred in lawless areas, where vigilantes committed the act for political purposes. Once the Taliban took over, it became a form of punishment for certain serious crimes or adultery. After the fall of the Taliban government, the Karzai administration re-enforced the 1976 penal code which made no provision for the use of stoning as a punishment. In 2013, the Ministry of Justice proposed public stoning as punishment for adultery. However, the government had to back down from the proposal after it was leaked and triggered international outcry. While stoning is officially banned in Afghanistan, it has continued to be reported occasionally as a crime.\n\nIn October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced that stoning, along with flogging and amputations, would be added to the country's laws in accordance with sharia law.\n\nOn 14 September 2009, the outgoing Aceh Legislative Council passed a bylaw that called for the stoning of married adulterers. However, then governor Irwandi Yusuf refused to sign the bylaw, thereby keeping it a law without legal force and, in some views, therefore still a law \"draft\", rather than actual law. In March 2013, the Aceh government removed the stoning provision from its own draft of a new criminal code.\n\nThe Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning in 2002; however, in 2007, the Iranian judiciary confirmed that a man who had been convicted of adultery 10 years earlier, was stoned to death in Qazvin province. In 2008, the judiciary tried to eliminate the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval. In 2009, two people were stoned to death in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan Province as punishment for the crime of adultery. In early 2013, a spokesman for judicial committee of Iran's parliament stated that stoning is no longer mentioned in Iran's legislation, but that punishment will remain the same as it is in Islamic law. He questioned Western enmity against Iran, and termed the campaign to remove \"rajm\" as noise against the implementation of Islamic law in Iran. Legal scholars concur that while certain stoning-related passages have been removed from Iran's new penal code, other passages in the new code refer to stoning, and stoning remains a possible form of punishment under the new Iranian penal code. The most known case in Iran was the stoning of Soraya Manutchehri in 1986.\n\n\nIn the 2008 version of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran detailed how stoning punishments are to be carried out for adultery, and even hints in some contexts that the punishment may allow for its victims to avoid death:\n\nArticle 102 – An adulterous man shall be buried in a ditch up to near his waist and an adulterous woman up to near her chest and then stoned to death.\nArticle 103 – In case the person sentenced to stoning escapes the ditch in which they are buried, then if the adultery is proven by testimony then they will be returned for the punishment but if it is proven by their own confession then they will not be returned.\nArticle 104 – The size of the stone used in stoning shall not be too large to kill the convict by one or two throws and at the same time shall not be too small to be called a stone.\n\nDepending upon the details of the case, the stoning may be initiated by the judge overseeing the matter or by one of the original witnesses to the adultery. Certain religious procedures may also need to be followed both before and after the implementation of a stoning execution, such as wrapping the person being stoned in traditional burial dress before the procedure.\n\nThe method of stoning set out in the 2008 code was similar to that in a 1999 version of Iran's penal code. Iran revised its penal code in 2013. The new code does not include the above passages, but does include stoning as a hadd punishment. For example, Book I, Part III, Chapter 5, Article 132 of the new Islamic Penal Code (IPC) of 2013 in the Islamic Republic of Iran states, \"If a man and a woman commit zina together more than one time, if the death penalty and flogging or stoning and flogging are imposed, only the death penalty or stoning, whichever is applicable, shall be executed\". Book 2, Part II, Chapter 1, Article 225 of the Iran's IPC released in 2013 states, \"the hadd punishment for zina of a man and a woman who meet the conditions of ihsan shall be stoning to death\".\n\nIn 2007, Du'a Khalil Aswad, a Yazidi girl, was stoned by her fellow tribesmen in northern Iraq for dating a Muslim boy.\n\nIn 2012 at least 14 youths were stoned to death in Baghdad, apparently as part of a Shi'ite militant campaign against Western-style \"emo\" fashion.\n\nAn Iraqi man was stoned to death, in August 2014, in the northern city of Mosul after one Sunni Islamic court sentenced him to die for the crime of adultery.\n\nSince the sharia legal system was introduced in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria in 2000, more than a dozen Nigerian Muslims have been sentenced to death by stoning for sexual offences ranging from adultery to homosexuality. However, none of these sentences has actually been carried out. They have either been thrown out on appeal or commuted to prison terms as a result of pressure from human rights groups.\n\nAs part of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization measures, stoning to death (\"rajm\") at a public place was introduced into law via the 1979 Hudood Ordinances as punishment for adultery (\"zina\") and rape (\"zina-bil-jabr\") when committed by a married person. However, stoning has never been officially utilized since the law came into effect and all judicial executions occur by hanging. The first conviction and sentence of stoning (of Fehmida and Allah-Bakhsh) in September 1981 was overturned under national and international pressure. A conviction for adultery of Safia Bibi, a 13-year-old blind girl who alleged that she was raped by her employer and his son, was reversed and the conviction was set aside on appeal after bitter public criticism. Another conviction for adultery and sentence of stoning (of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar) in early 1988 sparked outrage and led to a retrial and acquittal by the Federal Sharia Court. In this case the trial court took the view that notice of divorce by Shahida's former husband, Khushi Muhammad, should have been given to the Chairman of the local council, as stipulated under Section-7(3) of the \"Muslim Family Laws Ordinance\", 1961. This section states that any man who divorces his wife must register it with the Union Council. Otherwise, the court concluded that the divorce stood invalidated and the couple became liable to conviction under the Adultery ordinance. In 2006, the ordinances providing for stoning in the case of adultery or rape were legislatively demoted from overriding status.\n\nExtrajudicial stonings in Pakistan have been known to happen in recent times. In March 2013, Pakistani soldier Anwar Din, stationed in Parachinar, was publicly stoned to death for allegedly having a love affair with a girl from a village in the country's north western Kurram Agency. On 11 July 2013, Arifa Bibi, a young mother of two, was sentenced by a tribal court in Dera Ghazi Khan District, in Punjab, to be stoned to death for possessing a cell phone. Members of her family were ordered to execute her sentence and her body was buried in the desert far away from her village.\n\nIn February 2014, a couple in a remote area of Baluchistan province was stoned to death after being accused of an adulterous relationship. On 27 May 2014, Farzana Parveen, a 25-year-old married woman who was three months pregnant, was killed by being attacked with batons and bricks by nearly 20 members of her family outside the high court of Lahore in front of \"a crowd of onlookers\" according to a statement by a police investigator. The assailants, who allegedly included her father and brothers, attacked Farzana and her husband Mohammad Iqbal with batons and bricks. Her father Mohammad Azeem, who was arrested for murder, reportedly called the murder an \"honor killing\" and said \"I killed my daughter as she had insulted all of our family by marrying a man without our consent.\" The man whose second wife Farzana had become, Iqbal, told a news agency that he had strangled his previous wife in order to marry Farzana, and police said that he had been released for killing his first wife because a \"compromise\" had been reached with his family.\n\nLegal stoning sentences have been reported in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn May 2012, a Sudanese court convicted Intisar Sharif Abdallah of adultery and sentenced her to death; the charges were appealed and dropped two months later. In July 2012, a criminal court in Khartoum, Sudan, sentenced 23-year-old Layla Ibrahim Issa Jumul to death by stoning for adultery. Amnesty International reported that she was denied legal counsel during the trial and was convicted only on the basis of her confession. The organization designated her a prisoner of conscience, \"held in detention solely for consensual sexual relations\", and lobbied for her release. In September, Article 126 of the 1991 Sudan Criminal Law, which provided for death by stoning for apostasy, was amended to provide for death by hanging.\n\nIn October 2008, a girl, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was buried up to her neck at a Somalian football stadium, then stoned to death in front of more than 1,000 people. The stoning occurred after she had allegedly pleaded guilty to adultery in a sharia court in Kismayo, a city that was controlled by Islamist insurgents. According to the insurgents she had stated that she wanted sharia law to apply. However, other sources state that the victim had been crying, had begged for mercy and had to be forced into the hole before being buried up to her neck in the ground. Amnesty International later learned that the girl was in fact 13 years old and had been arrested by al-Shabab militia after she had reported being gang-raped by three men.\n\nIn December 2009, another instance of stoning was publicised after Mohamed Abukar Ibrahim was accused of adultery by the Hizbul Islam militant group.\n\nIn September 2014, Somali al Shabaab militants stoned a woman to death, after she was declared guilty of adultery by an informal court.\n\nStoning is a legal form of judicial punishment in UAE. In 2006, an expatriate was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery. Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning. In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi.\n\nSeveral adultery executions by stoning committed by IS have been reported in the autumn of 2014. The Islamic State's magazine, Dabiq, documented the stoning of a woman in Raqqa as a punishment for adultery.\n\nIn October 2014, IS released a video appearing to show a Syrian man stone his daughter to death for alleged adultery.\n\nThe late American Calvinist and Christian Reconstructionist cleric Rousas John (R. J.) Rushdoony, his son Mark and his son-in-law Gary North, supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence by stoning would include homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one's virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case.\n\nA survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2013 found varying support in the global Muslim population for stoning as a punishment for adultery (sex between people where at least one person is married; when both participants are unmarried they get 100 lashes). Highest support for stoning is found in Muslims of the Middle East-North Africa region and South-Asian countries while generally less support is found in Muslims living in the Mediterranean and Central Asian countries. Support is consistently higher in Muslims who want Sharia to be the law of the land than in Muslims who do not want Sharia. Support for stoning in various countries is as follows:\n\nSouth Asia:\n\nPakistan (86% in all Muslims, 89% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Afghanistan (84% in all Muslims, 85% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Bangladesh (54% in all Muslims, 55% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land)\nMiddle East-North Africa:\n\nPalestinian territories (81% in all Muslims, 84% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Egypt (80% in all Muslims, 81% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Jordan (65% in all Muslims, 67% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Iraq (57% in all Muslims, 58% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land)\n\nSoutheast Asia:\n\nMalaysia (54% in all Muslims, 60% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Indonesia (42% in all Muslims, 48% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Thailand (44% in all Muslims, 51% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land)\nSub-Saharan Africa:\n\nNiger (70% in all Muslims), Djibouti (67%), Mali (58%), Senegal (58%), Guinea Bissau (54%), Tanzania (45%), Ghana (42%), DR Congo (39%), Cameroon (36%), Nigeria (33%)\n\nCentral Asia:\n\nKyrgyzstan (26% in all Muslims, 39% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Tajikistan (25% in all Muslims, 51% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Azerbaijan (16%), Turkey (9% in all Muslims, 29% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land)\nSouthern and Eastern Europe:\n\nRussia (13% in all Muslims, 26% in Muslims who say sharia should be the law of the land), Kosovo (9% in all Muslims, 25% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Albania (6% in all Muslims, 25% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land), Bosnia (6% in all Muslims, 21% in Muslims who say Sharia should be the law of the land)\n\nPlaces where substantial numbers of Muslims did not answer the survey's question or are undecided about whether they support stoning for adultery include Malaysia (19% of all Muslims), Kosovo (18%), Iraq (14%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (12%) and Tajikistan (10%).\n\nStoning has been condemned by several human rights organizations. Some groups, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, oppose all capital punishment, including stoning. Other groups, such as RAWA (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan), or the International Committee against Stoning (ICAS), oppose stoning \"per se\" as an especially cruel practice.\n\nSpecific sentences of stoning, such as the Amina Lawal case, have often generated international protest. Groups such as Human Rights Watch, while in sympathy with these protests, have raised a concern that the Western focus on stoning as an especially \"exotic\" or \"barbaric\" act distracts from what they view as the larger problems of capital punishment. They argue that the \"more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system.\"\n\nIn Iran, the Stop Stoning Forever Campaign was formed by various women's rights activists after a man and a woman were stoned to death in Mashhad in May 2006. The campaign's main goal is to legally abolish stoning as a form of punishment for adultery in Iran.\n\nStoning is condemned by human rights groups as a form of cruel and unusual punishment and torture, and a serious violation of human rights.\n\nStoning has been condemned as a violation of women's rights and a form of discrimination against women. Although stoning is also applied to men, the vast majority of the victims are reported to be women.\nAccording to the international group Women Living Under Muslim Laws stoning \"is one of the most brutal forms of violence perpetrated against women in order to control and punish their sexuality and basic freedoms\".\n\nAmnesty International has argued that the reasons for which women suffer disproportionately from stoning include the fact that women are not treated equally and fairly by the courts; the fact that, being more likely to be illiterate than men, women are more likely to sign confessions to crimes which they did not commit; and the fact that general discrimination against women in other life aspects leaves them at higher risk of convictions for adultery.\n\nStoning also targets homosexuals and others who have same-sex relations in certain jurisdictions. In Mauritania, northern Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen, the legal punishment for sodomy is death by stoning.\n\nHuman rights organizations argue that many acts targeted by stoning should not be illegal in the first place, as outlawing them interferes with people's right to a private life. Amnesty International said that stoning deals with \"acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults, and choosing one’s religion\".\n\n\n\n\nIn the Tanakh (Old Testament):\n\nIn the New Testament:\nIn the Talmud\n\n\nIn the Tanakh and Old Testament:\n\nIn the New Testament:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "363628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363628", "title": "Tensor algebra", "text": "Tensor algebra\n\nIn mathematics, the tensor algebra of a vector space \"V\", denoted \"T\"(\"V\") or \"T\"(\"V\"), is the algebra of tensors on \"V\" (of any rank) with multiplication being the tensor product. It is the free algebra on \"V\", in the sense of being left adjoint to the forgetful functor from algebras to vector spaces: it is the \"most general\" algebra containing \"V\", in the sense of the corresponding universal property (see below).\n\nThe tensor algebra is important because many other algebras arise as quotient algebras of \"T\"(\"V\"). These include the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, Clifford algebras, the Weyl algebra and universal enveloping algebras.\n\nThe tensor algebra also has two coalgebra structures; one simple one, which does not make it a bialgebra, but does lead to the concept of a cofree coalgebra, and a more complicated one, which yields a bialgebra, and can be extended by giving an antipode to create a Hopf algebra structure.\n\n\"Note\": In this article, all algebras are assumed to be unital and associative. The unit is explicitly required to define the coproduct.\n\nLet \"V\" be a vector space over a field \"K\". For any nonnegative integer \"k\", we define the \"k\"th tensor power of \"V\" to be the tensor product of \"V\" with itself \"k\" times:\nThat is, \"T\"\"V\" consists of all tensors on \"V\" of order \"k\". By convention \"T\"\"V\" is the ground field \"K\" (as a one-dimensional vector space over itself).\n\nWe then construct \"T\"(\"V\") as the direct sum of \"T\"\"V\" for \"k\" = 0,1,2,…\nThe multiplication in \"T\"(\"V\") is determined by the canonical isomorphism\ngiven by the tensor product, which is then extended by linearity to all of \"T\"(\"V\"). This multiplication rule implies that the tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\") is naturally a graded algebra with \"T\"\"V\" serving as the grade-\"k\" subspace. This grading can be extended to a Z grading by appending subspaces formula_4 for negative integers \"k\".\n\nThe construction generalizes in straightforward manner to the tensor algebra of any module \"M\" over a \"commutative\" ring. If \"R\" is a non-commutative ring, one can still perform the construction for any \"R\"-\"R\" bimodule \"M\". (It does not work for ordinary \"R\"-modules because the iterated tensor products cannot be formed.)\n\nThe tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\") is also called the free algebra on the vector space \"V\", and is functorial. As with other free constructions, the functor \"T\" is left adjoint to some forgetful functor. In this case, it's the functor which sends each \"K\"-algebra to its underlying vector space.\n\nExplicitly, the tensor algebra satisfies the following universal property, which formally expresses the statement that it is the most general algebra containing \"V\":\n\nHere \"i\" is the canonical inclusion of \"V\" into \"T\"(\"V\") (the unit of the adjunction). One can, in fact, define the tensor algebra \"T\"(\"V\") as the unique algebra satisfying this property (specifically, it is unique up to a unique isomorphism), but one must still prove that an object satisfying this property exists.\n\nThe above universal property shows that the construction of the tensor algebra is \"functorial\" in nature. That is, \"T\" is a functor from K\"-Vect, the category of vector spaces over \"K\", to K\"-Alg, the category of \"K\"-algebras. The functoriality of \"T\" means that any linear map from \"V\" to \"W\" extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism from \"T\"(\"V\") to \"T\"(\"W\").\n\nIf \"V\" has finite dimension \"n\", another way of looking at the tensor algebra is as the \"algebra of polynomials over \"K\" in \"n\" non-commuting variables\". If we take basis vectors for \"V\", those become non-commuting variables (or \"indeterminates\") in \"T\"(\"V\"), subject to no constraints beyond associativity, the distributive law and \"K\"-linearity.\n\nNote that the algebra of polynomials on \"V\" is not formula_5, but rather formula_6: a (homogeneous) linear function on \"V\" is an element of formula_7 for example coordinates formula_8 on a vector space are covectors, as they take in a vector and give out a scalar (the given coordinate of the vector).\n\nBecause of the generality of the tensor algebra, many other algebras of interest can be constructed by starting with the tensor algebra and then imposing certain relations on the generators, i.e. by constructing certain quotient algebras of \"T\"(\"V\"). Examples of this are the exterior algebra, the symmetric algebra, Clifford algebras, the Weyl algebra and universal enveloping algebras.\n\nThe tensor algebra has two different coalgebra structures. One is compatible with the tensor product, and thus can be extended to a bialgebra, and can be further be extended with an antipode to a Hopf algebra structure. The other structure, although simpler, cannot be extended to a bialgebra. The first structure is developed immediately below; the second structure is given in the section on the cofree coalgebra, further down.\n\nThe development provided below can be equally well applied to the exterior algebra, using the wedge symbol formula_9 in place of the tensor symbol formula_10; a sign must also be kept track of, when permuting elements of the exterior algebra. This correspondence also lasts through the definition of the bialgebra, and on to the definition of a Hopf algebra. That is, the exterior algebra can also be given a Hopf algebra structure.\n\nSimilarly, the symmetric algebra can also be given the structure of a Hopf algebra, in exactly the same fashion, by replacing everywhere the tensor product formula_10 by the symmetrized tensor product formula_12, i.e. that product where formula_13\n\nIn each case, this is possible because the alternating product formula_9 and the symmetric product formula_12 obey the required consistency conditions for the definition of a bialgebra and Hopf algebra; this can be explicitly checked in the manner below. Whenever one has a product obeying these consistency conditions, the construction goes thorough; insofar as such a product gave rise to a quotient space, the quotient space inherits the Hopf algebra structure.\n\nIn the language of category theory, one says that there is a functor from the category of -vector spaces to the category of -associate algebras. But there is also a functor taking vector spaces to the category of exterior algebras, and a functor taking vector spaces to symmetric algebras. There is a natural map from to each of these. Verifying that quotienting preserves the Hopf algebra structure is the same as verifying that the maps are indeed natural.\n\nThe coalgebra is obtained by defining a coproduct or diagonal operator\n\nHere, formula_17 is used as a short-hand for formula_5 to avoid an explosion of parenthesis. The formula_19 symbol is used to denote the \"external\" tensor product, needed for the definition of a coalgebra. It is being used to distinguish it from the \"internal\" tensor product formula_10, which is already \"taken\" and being used to denote multiplication in the tensor algebra (see the section \"Multiplication\", below, for further clarification on this issue). In order to avoid confusion between these two symbols, most texts will replace formula_10 by a plain dot, or even drop it altogether, with the understanding that it is implied from context. This then allows the otimes symbol to be used in place of the boxtimes symbol. This is not done below, and the two symbols are used independently and explicitly, so as to show the proper location of each. The result is a bit more verbose, but should be easier to comprehend.\n\nThe definition of the operator formula_22 is most easily built up in stages, first by defining it for elements formula_23 and then by homomorphically extending it to the whole algebra. A suitable choice for the coproduct is then\n\nand\n\nwhere formula_26 is the unit of the field formula_27. By linearity, one obviously has\n\nfor all formula_29 It is straight-forward to verify that this definition satisfies the axioms of a coalgebra: that is, that\n\nwhere formula_31 is the identity map on formula_17. Indeed, one gets\nand likewise for the other side. At this point, one could invoke a lemma, and say that formula_22 extends trivially, by linearity, to all of formula_17, because formula_17 is a free object and formula_37 is a generator of the free algebra, and formula_22 is a homomorphism. However, it is insightful to provide explicit expressions. So, for formula_39, one has (by definition) the homomorphism\n\nExpanding, one has\n\nIn the above expansion, there is no need to ever write formula_42 as this is just plain-old scalar multiplication in the algebra; that is, one trivially has that formula_43\n\nThe extension above preserves the algebra grading. That is,\n\nContinuing in this fashion, one can obtain an explicit expression for the coproduct acting on a homogenous element of order \"m\":\nwhere the formula_46 symbol, which should appear as ш, the sha, denotes the shuffle product. This is expressed in the second summation, which is taken over all (p,m-p+1)-shuffles. The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write formula_47, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles. The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements formula_48 is \"preserved\" in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right. Any one given shuffle obeys\n\nAs before, the algebra grading is preserved:\n\nThe counit formula_51 is given by the projection of the field component out from the algebra. This can be written as formula_52 for formula_53 and formula_54 for formula_55. By homomorphism under the tensor product formula_10, this extends to \nfor all formula_58\nIt is a straight-forward matter to verify that this counit satisfies the needed axiom for the coalgebra:\nWorking this explicitly, one has\nwhere, for the last step, one has made use of the isomorphism formula_61, as is appropriate for the defining axiom of the counit.\n\nA bialgebra defines both multiplication, and comultiplication, and requires them to be compatible.\n\nMultiplication is given by an operator\nwhich, in this case, was already given as the \"internal\" tensor product. That is,\nThat is, formula_64 The above should make it clear why the formula_19 symbol needs to be used: the formula_10 was actually one and the same thing as formula_67; and notational sloppiness here would lead to utter chaos. To strengthen this: the tensor product formula_10 of the tensor algebra corresponds to the multiplication formula_67 used in the definition of an algebra, whereas the tensor product formula_19 is the one required in the definition of comultiplication in a coalgebra. These two tensor products are \"not\" the same thing!\n\nThe unit for the algebra\nis just the embedding, so that\nThat the unit is compatible with the tensor product formula_10 is \"trivial\": it is just part of the standard definition of the tensor product of vector spaces. That is, formula_74 for field element \"k\" and any formula_75 More verbosely, the axioms for an associative algebra require the two homomorphisms (or commuting diagrams):\non formula_77, and that symmetrically, on formula_78, that\nwhere the right-hand side of these equations should be understood as the scalar product.\n\nThe unit and counit, and multiplication and comultiplication, all have to satisfy compatibility conditions. It is straightforward to see that \nSimilarly, the unit is compatible with comultiplication:\nThe above requires the use of the isomorphism formula_82 in order to work; without this, one loses linearity. Component-wise,\nwith the right-hand side making use of the isomorphism.\n\nMultiplication and the counit are compatible:\nwhenever \"x\" or \"y\" are not elements of formula_27, and otherwise, one has scalar multiplication on the field: formula_86 The most difficult to verify is the compatibility of multiplication and comultiplication:\nwhere formula_88 exchanges elements. The compatibility condition only needs to be verified on formula_89; the full compatibility follows as a homomorphic extension to all of formula_90 The verification is verbose but straight-forward; it is not given here, except for the final result:\nFor formula_92 an explicit expression for this was given in the coalgebra section, above.\n\nThe Hopf algebra adds an antipode to the bialgebra axioms. The antipode formula_93 on formula_55 is given by\nThis is sometimes called the \"anti-identity\". The antipode on formula_96 is given by\nand on formula_98 by\nThis extends homomorphically to\n\nCompatibility of the antipode with multiplication and comultiplication requires that\nThis is straight-forward to verify componentwise on formula_102:\nSimilarly, on formula_53:\nRecall that\nand that \nfor any formula_108 that is \"not\" in formula_109\n\nOne may proceed in a similar manner, by homomorphism, verifying that the antipode inserts the appropriate cancellative signs in the shuffle, starting with the compatibility condition on formula_110 and proceeding by induction.\n\nOne may define a different coproduct on the tensor algebra, simpler than the one given above. It is given by\n\nHere, as before, one uses the notational trick formula_112 (recalling that formula_113 trivially).\n\nThis coproduct gives rise to a coalgebra. It describes a coalgebra that is dual to the algebra structure on \"T\"(\"V\"), where \"V\" denotes the dual vector space of linear maps \"V\" → F. In the same way that the tensor algebra is a free algebra, the corresponding coalgebra is termed (conilpotent) co-free. With the usual product this is not a bialgebra. It \"can\" be turned into a bialgebra with the product formula_114 where \"(i,j)\" denotes the binomial coefficient for formula_115. This bialgebra is known as the divided power Hopf algebra.\n\nThe difference between this, and the other coalgebra is most easily seen in the formula_110 term. Here, one has that\nfor formula_118, which is clearly missing a shuffled term, as compared to before.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "202722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202722", "title": "Tensor contraction", "text": "Tensor contraction\n\nIn multilinear algebra, a tensor contraction is an operation on a tensor that arises from the natural pairing of a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual. In components, it is expressed as a sum of products of scalar components of the tensor(s) caused by applying the summation convention to a pair of dummy indices that are bound to each other in an expression. The contraction of a single mixed tensor occurs when a pair of literal indices (one a subscript, the other a superscript) of the tensor are set equal to each other and summed over. In the Einstein notation this summation is built into the notation. The result is another tensor with order reduced by 2.\n\nTensor contraction can be seen as a generalization of the trace.\n\nLet \"V\" be a vector space over a field \"k\". The core of the contraction operation, and the simplest case, is the natural pairing of \"V\" with its dual vector space \"V\". The pairing is the linear transformation from the of these two spaces to the field \"k\":\n\ncorresponding to the bilinear form\n\nwhere \"f\" is in \"V\" and \"v\" is in \"V\". The map \"C\" defines the contraction operation on a tensor of type , which is an element of formula_3. Note that the result is a scalar (an element of \"k\"). Using the natural isomorphism between formula_3 and the space of linear transformations from \"V\" to \"V\", one obtains a basis-free definition of the trace.\n\nIn general, a tensor of type (with and ) is an element of the vector space\n\n(where there are \"m\" factors \"V\" and \"n\" factors \"V\"). Applying the natural pairing to the \"k\"th \"V\" factor and the \"l\"th \"V\" factor, and using the identity on all other factors, defines the (\"k\", \"l\") contraction operation, which is a linear map which yields a tensor of type . By analogy with the case, the general contraction operation is sometimes called the trace.\n\nIn tensor index notation, the basic contraction of a vector and a dual vector is denoted by\n\nwhich is shorthand for the explicit coordinate summation\n\n(where are the components of in a particular basis and are the components of in the corresponding dual basis).\n\nSince a general mixed dyadic tensor is a linear combination of decomposable tensors of the form formula_8, the explicit formula for the dyadic case follows: let\n\nbe a mixed dyadic tensor. Then its contraction is\n\nA general contraction is denoted by labeling one covariant index and one contravariant index with the same letter, summation over that index being implied by the summation convention. The resulting contracted tensor inherits the remaining indices of the original tensor. For example, contracting a tensor \"T\" of type (2,2) on the second and third indices to create a new tensor \"U\" of type (1,1) is written as\n\nBy contrast, let\n\nbe an unmixed dyadic tensor. This tensor does not contract; if its base vectors are dotted the result is the contravariant metric tensor,\n\nwhose rank is 2.\n\nAs in the previous example, contraction on a pair of indices that are either both contravariant or both covariant is not possible in general. However, in the presence of an inner product (also known as a metric) \"g\", such contractions are possible. One uses the metric to raise or lower one of the indices, as needed, and then one uses the usual operation of contraction. The combined operation is known as \"metric contraction\".\n\nContraction is often applied to tensor fields over spaces (e.g. Euclidean space, manifolds, or schemes). Since contraction is a purely algebraic operation, it can be applied pointwise to a tensor field, e.g. if \"T\" is a (1,1) tensor field on Euclidean space, then in any coordinates, its contraction (a scalar field) \"U\" at a point \"x\" is given by\n\nSince the role of \"x\" is not complicated here, it is often suppressed, and the notation for tensor fields becomes identical to that for purely algebraic tensors.\n\nOver a Riemannian manifold, a metric (field of inner products) is available, and both metric and non-metric contractions are crucial to the theory. For example, the Ricci tensor is a non-metric contraction of the Riemann curvature tensor, and the scalar curvature is the unique metric contraction of the Ricci tensor.\n\nOne can also view contraction of a tensor field in the context of modules over an appropriate ring of functions on the manifold or the context of sheaves of modules over the structure sheaf; see the discussion at the end of this article.\n\nAs an application of the contraction of a tensor field, let \"V\" be a vector field on a Riemannian manifold (for example, Euclidean space). Let formula_15 be the covariant derivative of \"V\" (in some choice of coordinates). In the case of Cartesian coordinates in Euclidean space, one can write\n\nThen changing index β to α causes the pair of indices to become bound to each other, so that the derivative contracts with itself to obtain the following sum:\n\nwhich is the divergence div \"V\". Then\n\nis a continuity equation for \"V\".\n\nIn general, one can define various divergence operations on higher-rank tensor fields, as follows. If \"T\" is a tensor field with at least one contravariant index, taking the covariant differential and contracting the chosen contravariant index with the new covariant index corresponding to the differential results in a new tensor of rank one lower than that of \"T\".\n\nOne can generalize the core contraction operation (vector with dual vector) in a slightly different way, by considering a pair of tensors \"T\" and \"U\". The tensor product formula_19 is a new tensor, which, if it has at least one covariant and one contravariant index, can be contracted. The case where \"T\" is a vector and \"U\" is a dual vector is exactly the core operation introduced first in this article.\n\nIn tensor index notation, to contract two tensors with each other, one places them side by side (juxtaposed) as factors of the same term. This implements the tensor product, yielding a composite tensor. Contracting two indices in this composite tensor implements the desired contraction of the two tensors.\n\nFor example, matrices can be represented as tensors of type (1,1) with the first index being contravariant and the second index being covariant. Let formula_20 be the components of one matrix and let formula_21 be the components of a second matrix. Then their multiplication is given by the following contraction, an example of the contraction of a pair of tensors:\n\nAlso, the interior product of a vector with a differential form is a special case of the contraction of two tensors with each other.\n\nLet \"R\" be a commutative ring and let \"M\" be a finite free module over \"R\". Then contraction operates on the full (mixed) tensor algebra of \"M\" in exactly the same way as it does in the case of vector spaces over a field. (The key fact is that the natural pairing is still perfect in this case.)\n\nMore generally, let \"O\" be a sheaf of commutative rings over a topological space \"X\", e.g. \"O\" could be the structure sheaf of a complex manifold, analytic space, or scheme. Let \"M\" be a locally free sheaf of modules over \"O\" of finite rank. Then the dual of \"M\" is still well-behaved and contraction operations make sense in this context.\n\n\n"}

Lynching in the United States—extrajudicial killing by a mob, which often served as a means of racial terrorism—frequently involved public torture of the victim or victims, and was in many instances followed by human trophy collecting, too.

{"id": "14808522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14808522", "title": "Triadic closure", "text": "Triadic closure\n\nTriadic closure is a concept in social network theory, first suggested by German sociologist Georg Simmel in his 1908 book \"Soziologie\" [\"Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation\"]. Triadic closure is the property among three nodes A, B, and C, such that if a strong tie exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C. This property is too extreme to hold true across very large, complex networks, but it is a useful simplification of reality that can be used to understand and predict networks.\n\nTriadic closure was made popular by Mark Granovetter in his 1973 article \"The Strength of Weak Ties\". There he synthesized the theory of cognitive balance first introduced by Fritz Heider in 1946 with a Simmelian understanding of social networks. In general terms, cognitive balance refers to the propensity of two individuals to want to feel the same way about an object. If the triad of three individuals is not closed, then the person connected to both of the individuals will want to close this triad in order to achieve closure in the relationship network.\n\nThe two most common measures of triadic closure for a graph are (in no particular order) the clustering coefficient and transitivity for that graph.\n\nOne measure for the presence of triadic closure is clustering coefficient, as follows:\n\nLet formula_1 be an undirected simple graph (i.e., a graph having no self-loops or multiple edges) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. Also, let formula_2 and formula_3 denote the number of vertices and edges in G, respectively, and let formula_4 be the degree of vertex i.\n\nThen we can define a triangle among the triple of vertices formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 to be a set with the following three edges: {(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}. Then we can define the number of triangles that vertex formula_5 is involved in as formula_9 and, as each triangle is counted three times, we can express the number of triangles in G as formula_10. Assuming that triadic closure holds, only two strong edges are required for a triple to form and the number of triples of vertex i is formula_11, assuming formula_12. Thus we can express formula_13.\n\nNow, for a vertex formula_5 with formula_12, the clustering coefficient formula_16 of vertex formula_5 is the fraction of triples for vertex formula_5 that are closed, and can be measured as formula_19. Thus, the clustering coefficient formula_20 of graph formula_21 is given by formula_22, where formula_23 is the number of nodes with degree at least 2.\n\nAnother measure for the presence of triadic closure is transitivity, defined as formula_24.\n\nIn a trust network, triadic closure is likely to develop due to the transitive property. If a node A trusts node B, and node B trusts node C, node A will have the basis to trust node C. In a social network, strong triadic closure occurs because there is increased opportunity for nodes A and C with common neighbor B to meet and therefore create at least weak ties. Node B also has the incentive to bring A and C together to decrease the latent stress in two separate relationships.\n\nNetworks that stay true to this principle become highly interconnected and have very high clustering coefficients. However, networks that do not follow this principle turn out to be poorly connected and may suffer from instability once negative relations are included.\n\nTriadic closure is a good model for how networks will evolve over time. While simple graph theory tends to analyze networks at one point in time, applying the triadic closure principle can predict the development of ties within a network and show the progression of connectivity.\n\nIn social networks, triadic closure facilitates cooperative behavior, but when new connections are made via\nreferrals from existing connections the average global fraction of cooperators is less than when individuals choose new connections randomly from the population at large. Two possible effects for this are by the structural and informational construction. The structural construction arises from the propensity toward high clusterability. The informational construction comes from the assumption that an individual knows something about a friend's friend, as opposed to a random stranger.\n\nStrong Triadic Closure Property is that if a node has strong ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a weak tie between them. A local bridge occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a gatekeeper between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie.\n\nLet node B be a local bridge between nodes A and C such that there is no weak tie between the nodes involved. Therefore, B has a strong tie to both A and C. By the definition of Strong Triadic Closure, a weak tie would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus at least one of the nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie to prevent triadic closure from occurring.\n"}

It is a scaffold-like construction of poles on which heads and skulls were placed after holes had been made in them. Many have been documented throughout Mesoamerica, and range from the Epiclassic (ca. 600–900 CE) through early Post-Classic (ca. 900–1250 CE). In 2017 archeologists announced the discovery of the Huey Tzompantli, with more than 650 skulls, in the archeological zone of the Templo Mayor in Mexico city.\n\nThe name comes from the Classical Nahuatl language of the Aztecs but is also commonly applied to similar structures depicted in other civilizations. Its precise etymology is uncertain although its general interpretation is \"skull rack,\" \"wall of skulls,\" or \"skull banner.\" It's most likely a compound of the Nahuatl words \"tzontecomatl\" (\"skull\"; from \"tzontli\" or \"tzom-\" \"hair\", \"scalp\" and \"tecomatl\" (\"gourd\" or \"container\"), and \"pamitl\" (\"banner\"). That derivation has been ascribed to explain the depictions in several codices that associate these with banners; however, Nahuatl linguist Frances Karttunen has proposed that \"pantli\" means merely \"row\" or \"wall.\"\n\nIt was most commonly erected as a linearly-arranged series of vertical posts connected by a series of horizontal crossbeams. The skulls were pierced or threaded laterally along these horizontal stakes. An alternate arrangement, more common in the Maya regions, was for the skulls to be impaled on top of one another along the vertical posts.\n\n\"Tzompantli\" are known chiefly from their depiction in Late Postclassic (13th to 16th centuries) and post-Conquest (mid-16th to 17th centuries) codices, contemporary accounts of the conquistadores, and several other inscriptions. However, a \"tzompantli\"-like structure, thought to be the first instance of such structures, has been excavated from the Proto-Classic Zapotec civilization at the La Coyotera, Oaxaca site, dated from c. 2nd century BCE to 3rd century CE. The Zapotecs called this structure a \"\"yàgabetoo\",\" and it displayed 61 skulls.\n\n\"Tzompantli\" are also noted in other Mesoamerican pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Toltec and Mixtec.\n\nAt the Toltec capital of Tula exists the first indications in Central Mexico of a real fascination with skulls and skeletons. Tula flourished from the ninth until the thirteenth century. The site includes the decimated remains of a tzompantli. The tzompantli at Tula displayed multiple rows of stone carved skulls adorning the sides of a broad platform upon which the actual skulls of sacrificial victims were exhibited. The tzompantli appeared during the final phases of civilization at Tula, which was destroyed around 1200.\n\nOther examples are indicated from Maya civilization sites such as Uxmal and other Puuc region sites of the Yucatán, dating from around the late 9th-century decline of the Maya Classical Era. A particularly fine and intact inscription example survives at the extensive Chichen Itza site.\nHuman sacrifice on a large scale was introduced to the Maya by the Toltecs from the appearances of the tzompantli by the Chichen Itza ball courts. Six ball court reliefs at Chichen Itza depict the decapitation of a ball player; it seems that the losers would be beheaded and would have their skulls placed on the Tzompantli.\n\nThe word \"tzompantli\" is Nahuatl and was used by the Aztecs to refer to the skull-racks found in many Aztec cities; The first and most prominent example is the Huey Tzompantli (Great Skull-rack) located the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan and described by the early conquistadors. There were at least five more skull racks in Tenochtitlan but by all accounts they were much smaller. \n\nAccording to Bernal Díaz del Castillo's eye-witness account, the \"Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España\", written several decades after the event, after Cortes' expedition was forced to make their initial retreat from Tenochtitlan, the Aztecs erected a makeshift tzompantli to display the severed heads of men and horses they had captured from the invaders. This \"tzompantli\" is depicted in the twelfth book of the Florentine Codex. This taunting is also depicted in an Aztec codex which relates the story, and the subsequent battles which led to the eventual capture of the city by the Spanish forces and their allies.\n\nDuring the stay of Cortes' expedition in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (initially as guest-captives of the Emperor Moctezuma II, before the battle which would lead to the conquest), they reported a wooden \"tzompantli\" altar adorned with the skulls from recent sacrifices. Within the complex of the Templo Mayor itself, a relief in stucco depicted these sacrifices; the remains of this relief have survived and may now be seen in the ruins in the Zócalo of present-day Mexico City. \n\nExcavations at Templo Mayor in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan have revealed many skulls belonging to women and children, in addition to those of men, a demonstration of the diversity of the human sacrifices in Aztec culture. After displaying severed heads, many scholars have determined that limbs of Aztec victims would be cannibalized Fray Diego Durán confirms this, stating that skulls were delivered to temples after \"the flesh had been eaten\".\n\nDurán notes that the \"tzompantli\" were periodically renovated. Regarding this, Durán states\"When [the skulls] become old and deteriorated, they fell in pieces. When the palisade become old, however, it was renovated, and on its removal many [skulls] broke. Others were removed to make room for more, so that there would be a place for those were to be killed later\"Archeologist Eduardo Contreras believes that the tissue attached to skulls was removed prior to a \"tzompantli\" pole being inserted through the side of the skulls. He bases these assumptions off of excavations of the Plaza de las Tres Culturas at Tlatelolco, Mexico City between 1960 and 1965. \n\nThe Huey Tzompantli was the central \"tzompantli\" found in Tenochtitlan. The skull rack here served as a reminder of the Aztec's ongoing Flowery Wars. An important aspect of Aztec warfare was the capture of enemy warriors to serve as sacrificial victims, which is evident from the number of warriors found sacrificed around Aztec structures. One conquistador, Andrés de Tapia, was given the task of counting the skulls on the \"tzompantli\" at Tenochtitlan and estimated that there were 136,000 skulls on it. However, based on numbers given by Taipa and Fray Diego Durán, Bernard Ortiz de Montellano has calculated that there were at most 60,000 skulls on the \"Hueyi Tzompantli\" (Great Skullrack) of Tenochtitlan. The \"Hueyi Tzompantli\" consisted of a massive masonry platform composed of “thirty long steps” measuring fully 60 meters in length by 30 meters wide at its summit. Atop of the aforementioned platform was erected an equally formidable wooden palisade and scaffolding consisting of between 60 and 70 massive uprights or timbers woven together with an impressive constellation of horizontal cross beams upon which were suspended the tens of thousands of decapitated human heads once impaled thereon. Regarding, this Bernal Díaz de Castillo states \"I remember that they had in a plaza, where there were some shrines, so many places of dead skulls, which could be counted, according to the concert as they were set, that when they appeared they would be more than one hundred thousand; and I say again about one hundred thousand. And in another part of the square were as many rowers of bones without meat, bones of dead, that could not be counted; and they had in many beams many heads hanging from one part to another. And  keeping those bones and skulls were three priests, who, as we understood, wherein charge of them.  Of which we had to look more after we entered the land well: in all the villages they were that way, and also in Tascala.\"Various scholarly interpretations of the cosmological importance of Huey Tzompantli's placement have emerged. Matos Monteczum claims that a central \"tzompantli\" was placed north of the Templo Mayor. Monteczuma notes that no corresponding shrine was found south. Monteczuma also notes that Mexica views of the universe, which divide the universe into a horizontal and vertical plane, claim that the northern sector of the horizontal plane corresponds to Mictlampa, or the land of the dead. On the other hand, Rubén G. Mendoza contends that the Huey Tzompantli was placed on an east-west axis between the Templo Mayor and a principal ball court. The Huey Tzompantli would have been aligned with the marker within the Templo Mayor dividing one half for Tlaloc and the other half for Huitzilopochtli. Mendoza argues that as the sun traveled through the sky, it would have ascended into the \"vault of the heavens,\" represented by the Huey Tzompantli. \n\nModern archeological evidence has found that this large palisade was flanked by two circular towers made out of skulls and mortar. \n\nThere are numerous depictions of \"tzompantli\" in Aztec codices, dating from around the time or shortly after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, such as the \"Durán Codex\", \"Ramírez Codex\", and \"Codex Borgia\". The Codex Mendoza contains multiple depictions of \"tzompantli.\" The Frontispiece of the Codex Mendoza depicts a \"tzompantli\" holding single skull next to an eagle perched on a cactus. A similar depiction of a \"tzompantli is\" used to represent the town of Tzompanco in the Codex Mendoza. Folio 45v of the Codex Borgia depicts a platform adorned with skulls. \n\nArchaeologists affilitated with the National Institute of Anthropology and History have partaken in a series of excavations since 2015 that have resulted in the finding of \"tzompantli.\" These excavations took place near the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and resulted in the finding of one \"tzompantli\" tower. These excavations have revealed that women and children were sacrificed, despite men making up 75% of sacrificial victims. \n\nApart from their use to display the skulls of ritualistically-executed war captives, \"tzompantli\" often occur in the contexts of Mesoamerican ball courts, which were widespread throughout the region's civilizations and sites. The game was 'played for keeps' ending with the losing team being sacrificed. The captain of the winning team was tasked with taking the head of the losing team's captain to be displayed on a tzompantli. In these contexts it appears that the tzompantli was used to display the losers' heads of this often highly ritualised game. Not all games resulted in this outcome, however, and for those that did it is surmised that these participants were often notable captives. An alternative theory is that it was the captain of the winning team who lost his head, but there is little evidence that this was the case. Still, it is acknowledged that in Mesoamerican culture to be sacrificed was to be honored with feeding the gods.\nTula, the former Toltec capital, has a well-preserved \"tzompantli\" inscription on its ball court.\n\nThe association with ball courts is also reflected in the \"Popol Vuh\", the famous religious, mythological and cultural account of the K'iche' Maya. When Hun Hunahpu, father of the Maya Hero Twins, was killed by the lords of the Underworld (Xibalba), his head was hung in a gourd tree next to a ball court. The gourd tree is a clear representation of a \"tzompantli\", and the image of skulls in trees as if they were fruits is also a common indicator of a tzompantli and the associations with some of the game's metaphorical interpretations.\n\n\"Tzompantli\" have been the subject of multiple artworks made by during the twentieth century. Jose Chavez Morado depicted \"tzompantli\" in a 1961 painting. George O. Jackson, as part of his Essence of Mexico project, photographed various representations of skulls, which he refers to as \"calaveras.\" Jackson refers to groups of these pictures as \"tzompantli.\" \"Tzompantli\" were also the subject of murals created for the festival Mextonia, which celebrates Mexican culture and occurs in Estonia, by the art collective Nueve Arte Urbano. The Museo de Arte de Querétaro featured an exhibit titled \"Tzompantli,\" which featured works made by various artists depicting skulls. \n\n\n"}

Together with the Hahn–Banach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.\n\nThe theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.\n\nTheorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle). Let \"X\" and \"Y\" be Banach spaces. Suppose that \"F\" is a collection of continuous linear operators from \"X\" to \"Y\". If for all \"x\" in \"X\" one has\n\nthen\n\nThe completeness of \"X\" enables the following short proof, using the Baire category theorem.\n\nProof. Suppose that for every \"x\" in the Banach space \"X\", one has:\n\nFor every integer formula_4, let\n\nThe set formula_6 is a closed set and by the assumption,\n\nBy the Baire category theorem for the non-empty complete metric space \"X\", there exists \"m\" such that \nformula_8 has non-empty interior, \"i.e.\", there exist formula_9 and such that\n\nLet \"u\" ∈ \"X\" with and . One has that:\n\nTaking the supremum over \"u\" in the unit ball of \"X\" and over formula_12, it follows that\n\nThere are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem .\n\nCorollary. If a sequence of bounded operators (\"T\") converges pointwise, that is, the limit of {\"T\"(\"x\")} exists for all \"x\" in \"X\", then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator \"T\".\n\nNote it is not claimed above that \"T\" converges to \"T\" in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since {\"T\"} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator \"T\" is continuous, a standard \"3-ε\" estimate shows that \"T\" converges to \"T\" uniformly on \"compact\" sets.)\n\nCorollary. Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.\"\n\nIndeed, the elements of \"S\" define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space \"X\" = \"Y*\", continuous dual of \"Y\". By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of \"S\", as functionals on \"X\", that is, norms in the second dual \"Y**\", are bounded. But for every \"s\" in \"S\", the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in \"Y\", by a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.\n\nLet \"L\"(\"X\", \"Y\") denote the continuous operators from \"X\" to \"Y\", with the operator norm. If the collection \"F\" is unbounded in \"L\"(\"X\", \"Y\"), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have:\n\nIn fact, \"R\" is dense in \"X\". The complement of \"R\" in \"X\" is the countable union of closed sets ∪\"X\". By the argument used in proving the theorem, each \"X\" is nowhere dense, i.e. the subset ∪\"X\" is \"of first category\". Therefore \"R\" is the complement of a subset of first category in a Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called \"residual sets\") are dense. Such reasoning leads to the principle of condensation of singularities, which can be formulated as follows:\n\nTheorem. Let \"X\" be a Banach space, {\"Y\"} a sequence of normed vector spaces, and \"F\" a unbounded family in \"L\"(\"X\", \"Y\"). Then the set\n\nis of second category, and thus dense in \"X\".\n\nProof. The complement of \"R\" is the countable union\n\nof sets of first category. Therefore its residual set \"R\" is dense.\n\nLet formula_17 be the circle, and let formula_18 be the Banach space of continuous functions on formula_17, with the uniform norm. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in formula_18 for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise.\n\nFor formula_21, its Fourier series is defined by\n\nand the \"N\"-th symmetric partial sum is\n\nwhere \"D\" is the \"N\"-th Dirichlet kernel. Fix formula_24 and consider the convergence of {\"S\"(\"f\")(\"x\")}. The functional φ : formula_25 defined by\n\nis bounded. The norm of φ, in the dual of formula_18, is the norm of the signed measure (2π)\"D\"(\"x\"−\"t\") d\"t\", namely\n\nOne can verify that\n\nSo the collection {φ} is unbounded in formula_30, the dual of formula_18. Therefore by the uniform boundedness principle, for any formula_24, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at \"x\" is dense in formula_18.\n\nMore can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let {\"x\"} be a dense sequence in formula_17. Define φ in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each \"x\" is dense in formula_18 (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function \"f\" converges to \"f\"(\"x\") for almost every formula_24, by Carleson's theorem).\n\nThe least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a barrelled space where the following generalised version of the theorem holds :\n\nTheorem. Given a barrelled space \"X\" and a locally convex space \"Y\", then any family of pointwise bounded continuous linear mappings from \"X\" to \"Y\" is equicontinuous (even uniformly equicontinuous).\n\nAlternatively, the statement also holds whenever \"X\" is a Baire space and \"Y\" is a locally convex space .\n\nTheorem. Let \"X\" be a Fréchet space, \"Y\" a normed space, and \"H\" a set of continuous linear mappings of \"X\" into \"Y\". If for every \"x\" in \"X\"\nthen the family \"H\" is equicontinuous.\n\n\n"}
