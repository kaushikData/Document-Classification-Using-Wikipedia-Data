The winning team was composed by four girls from St Marylebone School.\n\nThe programme also profiled several women that are currently in the industry to showcase the variety of careers available within transport.\n\nIn November 2015, the campaign celebrated 100 years since the first female bus conductor, Ms G. Duncan, started to work in London on 1 November 1915.\n\n"}
{"id": "233013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233013", "title": "Absurdism", "text": "Absurdism\n\nIn philosophy, \"the Absurd\" refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any in a purposeless, meaningless or chaotic and irrational universe. The universe and the human mind do not each separately cause the Absurd, but rather, the Absurd arises by the contradictory nature of the two existing simultaneously. \n\nAs a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.\n\nAbsurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with existentialism and nihilism. It has its origins in the work of the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who chose to confront the crisis that humans face with the Absurd by developing his own existentialist philosophy. Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought and published his essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". The aftermath of World War II provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of France.\n\nIn absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, \"The Sickness Unto Death\" (1849) and \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" (1942), respectively:\n\n\nAbsurdism originated from (as well as alongside) the 20th-century strains of existentialism and nihilism; it shares some prominent starting points with both, though also entails conclusions that are uniquely distinct from these other schools of thought. All three arose from the human experience of anguish and confusion stemming from the Absurd: the apparent meaninglessness in a world in which humans, nevertheless, are compelled to find or create meaning. The three schools of thought diverge from there. Existentialists have generally advocated the individual's construction of his or her own meaning in life as well as the free will of the individual. Nihilists, on the contrary, contend that \"it is futile to seek or to affirm meaning where none can be found.\" Absurdists, following Camus's formulation, hesitantly allow the possibility for some meaning or value in life, but are neither as certain as existentialists are about the value of one's own constructed meaning nor as nihilists are about the total inability to create meaning. Absurdists following Camus also devalue or outright reject free will, encouraging merely that the individual live defiantly and authentically \"in spite of\" the psychological tension of the Absurd.\n\nCamus himself passionately worked to counter nihilism, as he explained in his essay \"The Rebel,\" while he also categorically rejected the label of \"existentialist\" in his essay \"Enigma\" and in the compilation \"The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus\", though he was, and still is, often broadly characterized by others as an existentialist. Both existentialism and absurdism entail consideration of the practical applications of becoming conscious of the truth of existential nihilism: i.e., how a driven seeker of meaning should act when suddenly confronted with the seeming concealment, or downright absence, of meaning in the universe. Camus's own understanding of the world (e.g., \"a benign indifference\", in \"The Stranger\"), and every vision he had for its progress, however, sets him apart from the general existentialist trend.\n\nSuch a chart represents some of the overlap and tensions between existentialist and absurdist approaches to meaning. While absurdism can be seen as a kind of response to existentialism, it can be debated exactly how substantively the two positions differ from each other. The existentialist, after all, doesn't deny the reality of death. But the absurdist seems to reaffirm the way in which death ultimately nullifies our meaning-making activities, a conclusion the existentialists seem to resist through various notions of posterity or, in Sartre's case, participation in a grand humanist project.\n\nA century before Camus, the 19th century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard wrote extensively about the absurdity of the world. In his journals, Kierkegaard writes about the absurd:\n\nHere is another example of the Absurd from his writings: \n\nHow can this absurdity be held or believed? Kierkegaard says: \n\nKierkegaard provides an example in \"Fear and Trembling\" (1843), which was published under the pseudonym \"Johannes de Silentio\". In the story of Abraham in the Book of Genesis, Abraham is told by God to kill his son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue of the absurd, Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties (\"you cannot act\"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith (\"where I have to act\").\n\nAnother instance of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in \"The Sickness Unto Death\", which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym \"Anti-Climacus\". Exploring the forms of despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced at the beginning of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.\n\nAccording to Kierkegaard in his autobiography \"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\", most of his pseudonymous writings are not necessarily reflective of his own opinions. Nevertheless, his work anticipated many absurdist themes and provided its theoretical background.\n\nThough the notion of the 'absurd' pervades all Albert Camus's writing, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" is his chief work on the subject. In it, Camus considers absurdity as a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict or a \"divorce\" between two ideals. Specifically, he defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand – and the silent, cold universe on the other. He continues that there are specific human experiences evoking notions of absurdity. Such a realization or encounter with the absurd leaves the individual with a choice: suicide, a leap of faith, or recognition. He concludes that recognition is the only defensible option.\n\nFor Camus, suicide is a \"confession\" that life is not worth living; it is a choice that implicitly declares that life is \"too much.\" Suicide offers the most basic \"way out\" of absurdity: the immediate termination of the self and its place in the universe.\n\nThe absurd encounter can also arouse a \"leap of faith,\" a term derived from one of Kierkegaard's early pseudonyms, \"Johannes de Silentio\" (although the term was not used by Kierkegaard himself), where one believes that there is more than the rational life (aesthetic or ethical). To take a \"leap of faith,\" one must act with the \"virtue of the absurd\" (as \"Johannes de Silentio\" put it), where a suspension of the ethical may need to exist. This faith has no expectations, but is a flexible power initiated by a recognition of the absurd. (Although at some point, one recognizes or encounters the existence of the Absurd and, in response, actively ignores it.) However, Camus states that because the leap of faith escapes rationality and defers to abstraction over personal experience, the leap of faith is not absurd. Camus considers the leap of faith as \"philosophical suicide,\" rejecting both this and physical suicide.\n\nLastly, a person can choose to embrace the absurd condition. According to Camus, one's freedom – and the opportunity to give life meaning – lies in the recognition of absurdity. If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes, then we as individuals are truly free. \"To live without appeal,\" as he puts it, is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively, rather than objectively. The freedom of humans is thus established in a human's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose; to decide (or think) for him- or herself. The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence, representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right. In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.\n\nCamus states in \"The Myth of Sisyphus\": \"Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death, and I refuse suicide.\" \"Revolt\" here refers to the refusal of suicide and search for meaning despite the revelation of the Absurd; \"Freedom\" refers to the lack of imprisonment by religious devotion or others' moral codes; \"Passion\" refers to the most wholehearted experiencing of life, since hope has been rejected, and so he concludes that every moment must be lived fully.\n\nAccording to absurdism, humans historically attempt to find meaning in their lives. Traditionally, this search results in one of two conclusions: either that life is meaningless, or life contains within it a purpose set forth by a higher power—a belief in God, or adherence to some religion or other abstract concept. \n\nCamus perceives filling the void with some invented belief or meaning as a mere \"act of eluding\"—that is, avoiding or escaping rather than acknowledging and embracing the Absurd. To Camus, elusion is a fundamental flaw in religion, existentialism, and various other schools of thought. If the individual eludes the Absurd, then he or she can never confront it.\nCamus also concedes that elusion is the most common.\n\nEven with a spiritual power as the answer to meaning, another question arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? Kierkegaard believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to \"deny one of the terms of the contradiction\" between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd but what he calls \"philosophical suicide\"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God. Camus notes, \"I did not say 'excludes God', which would still amount to asserting\".\n\nFor Camus, the beauty people encounter in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning in their own lives, which may not be the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.\n\nFreedom cannot be achieved beyond what the absurdity of existence permits; however, the closest one can come to being absolutely free is through acceptance of the Absurd. Camus introduced the idea of \"acceptance without resignation\" as a way of dealing with the recognition of absurdity, asking whether or not man can \"live without appeal\", while defining a \"conscious revolt\" against the avoidance of absurdity of the world. In a world devoid of higher meaning or judicial afterlife, the human nature becomes as close to absolutely free as is humanly possible.\n\nThe rejection of hope, in absurdism, denotes the refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, has nothing to do with despair (meaning that the two terms are not opposites). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so \"without\" hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method of evading the Absurd, and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest. In the words of Nikos Kazantzakis's epitaph: \"I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.\"\n\nThe absurdist is not guided by morality, but rather, by their own integrity. The absurdist is, in fact, amoral (though not necessarily immoral). The Absurdist's view of morality implies an unwavering sense of definite right and wrong at all times, while integrity implies honesty with one's self and consistency in the motivations of one's actions and decisions.\n\n\n"}

The ACL was constructed by Harrison G. Gough and Alfred B. Heilbrun, Jr. with the goal to assess psychological traits of an individual. The ACL measures 37 scales within 5 categories: modus operandi (4 scales), need (15 scales), topical (9 scales), transactional analysis (5 scales), and origence-intellectence (4 scales). To complete the ACL, respondents select the adjectives that they believe describe themselves (or someone else). Any number of items may be selected from the list of adjectives. In this way, the results are customized to include only those adjectives salient to the individual being assessed. The ACL takes between 10-15 minutes to complete and may be administered to individuals, groups, or used by researchers to describe study participants. The ACL is protected by copyright law, published by Consulting Psychologists Press, and distributed by Mind Garden, Inc.\n\nThe ACL was first developed in the early days of the Institute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California, Berkeley. It has been used since 1952 by many psychologists worldwide and is one of the 100 most frequently used and cited tests in psychology.\n\n\"The ACL offers several advantages. It is self-administering, may be completed in 10 to 15 minutes, arouses little resistance or anxiety, and has proved useful in studies of highly effective persons in occupations other than politics such as architecture, mathematics, law, medicine, and management.\n\n\"Further, as a multidimensional instrument, which taps several domains of personality, the ACL affords an appraisal of positive as well as negative factors in human behavior, thus avoiding the frequently found preoccupation with psychopathological bases of political activity. Additionally, as an established standardized, and quantitative assessment procedure, the ACL reduces the problems of reliability and comparability entailed in studies relying on interviews or on ad hoc, limited use or abbreviated personality measures” (Constantini & Craik, 1980, p. 645).\n\n\"We propose that the Gough-Heilbrun Adjective Check List is another broad-range instrument with considerable promise as a general cross-cultural research tool. The argument is based on: the nature of the task, which seems appropriate in many cultural settings; the versatility of the method in addressing a variety of research questions; the fact that the instrument has been translated into many different languages; and the successful use of the method in recent cross-cultural studies\" (Williams & Best, 1983, p. 164).\n\nThe ACL scales were realigned in 2012 by Rob Devine in consultation with Gough to highlight how collections of characteristics, skills, and competencies impact success at work. This realignment, called Success Factors at Work, uses 30 of the original 37 ACL scales and assigns each to one of six Work Success Factors which have proven to be central and important to success at work.

These were identified as important in Henry A. Murray's Need-Press Theory of Personality.\n\nThe Topical Scales assess a diverse set of attributes, potentialities, and role characteristics.\n\nThe Transactional Analysis Scales - an Egogram - assess components of ego functioning. These were identified as important by Eric Berne's Transactional Analysis theory of personality.\n\nThe Origence-Intellectence Scales assess the balance between preferences for affective-emotional and rational-realistic models of functioning.

Leibniz introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work \"Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce\"; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern attention, by which an object is apprehended as \"not-self\" and yet in relation to the self.\n\nImmanuel Kant distinguished transcendental apperception from empirical apperception. The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject--\"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience.\" The second is \"the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states\", the so-called \"inner sense.\" (Otto F. Kraushaar in \"Runes\"). Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved. See \"Kantianism\".\n\nThe German philosopher Theodor Lipps distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, \"Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken\". Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object. \n\nIn psychology, apperception is \"the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole.\" In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of Herbert Spencer, Hermann Lotze, and Wilhelm Wundt. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived.\n\nAccording to Johann Friedrich Herbart apperception is that process by which an aggregate or \"mass\" of presentations becomes systematized (\"apperceptions-system\") by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind. He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience. Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows.\n\nApperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process.\n\nA rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they \"apperceive\" the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.|Christopher Ott\nIn epistemology, apperception is \"the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "337044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337044", "title": "Audi alteram partem", "text": "Audi alteram partem\n\n' (or ') is a Latin phrase meaning \"listen to the other side\", or \"let the other side be heard as well\". It is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against them.\n\n\"Audi alteram partem\" is considered to be a principle of fundamental justice or equity or the principle of natural justice in most legal systems. This principle includes the rights of a party or his lawyers to confront the witnesses against him, to have a fair opportunity to challenge the evidence presented by the other party, to summon one's own witnesses and to present evidence, and to have counsel, if necessary at public expense, in order to make one's case properly.\n\nThe phrase has come to be used as the motto for various political and judicial organisations, and is also the origin of the name of the German carmaker Audi.\n\nAs a general principle of rationality in reaching conclusions in disputed matters, \"Hear both sides\" was treated as part of common wisdom by the ancient Greek dramatists. A similar principle can also be found in Islamic law, based on a hadith indicating that in litigation, both parties must be heard. The principle was referred to by the International Court of Justice in the \"Nuclear Tests\" case, referring to France's non-appearance at judgment. Modern legal systems differ on whether individuals can be convicted \"in absentia\". The principle is used in labour law matters in countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Political Interest Society of the University of Melbourne uses the phrase as its motto. The All-Campus Judicial Council of the University of Rochester has used the phrase as its motto since 2001.\n\nThe phrase is also the origin of the name of German carmaker Audi. Founder August Horch had left his previous company, Motorwagenwerke, after a dispute with partners and founded a new company on 16 July 1909, initially named the \"August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH\". His former partners sued him for trademark infringement, and the German Reichsgericht (Supreme Court) ruled that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. Horch therefore called a meeting with close business friends Paul and Franz Fikentscher, to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, \"Father – \"audiatur et altera pars\"... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it \"audi\" instead of \"horch\"?\" \"Horch!\" in German means \"Hark!\" or \"hear\", which is \"Audi\" in the singular imperative form of \"audire\" – \"to listen\" – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting, and the company was registered as \"Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau\" in 1910.\n\n"}

The book models the animal world in a minimalistic and constructive way, from simple reactive behaviours (like phototaxis) through the simplest vehicles, to the formation of concepts, spatial behaviour, and generation of ideas.\n\nFor the simplest vehicles, the motion of the vehicle is directly controlled by some sensors (for example photo cells). Yet the resulting behaviour may appear complex or even intelligent.\n\nA Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors. In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.\n\nDepending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented). This means that, depending on the sensor-motor wiring, it appears to strive to achieve certain situations and to avoid others, changing course when the situation changes.\n\nThe connections between sensors and actuators for the simplest vehicles (2 and 3) can be ipsilateral or contralateral, and excitatory or inhibitory, producing four combinations with different behaviours named fear, aggression, liking, and love. These correspond to biological positive and negative taxes present in many animals species.\n\nThe following examples are some of Braitenberg's simplest vehicles.\n\nThe first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle moves ideally in one dimension only and can stand still or move forward at varying speed depending on the sensed temperature. When forces like asymmetric friction come into play, the vehicle could deviate from its straight line motion in unpredictable ways akin to Brownian motion.\n\nThis behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement. The low velocity in regions of low temperature might be interpreted as a preference for cold areas.\n\nA slightly more complex agent has two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors) each stimulating a wheel on the same side of the body. This vehicle represents a model of negative animal tropotaxis. It obeys the following rule:\nThis is more efficient as a behavior to escape from the light source, since the creature can move in different directions, and tends to orient towards the direction from which least light comes.\n\nIn another variation, the connections are negative or inhibitory: more light → slower movement. In this case, the agents move away from the dark and towards the light.\n\nThe agent has the same two (left and right) symmetric sensors (e.g. light detectors), but each one stimulating a wheel on the other side of the body. It obeys the following rule:\nAs a result, the robot follows the light; it moves to be closer to the light.\n\nIn a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.\n\nDepending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.\n\nThis behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any information processing or other apparently cognitive processes.\n\nOften, BEAM robotics implements these sorts of behaviors.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24104095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24104095", "title": "Cartesian product", "text": "Cartesian product\n\nIn set theory (and, usually, in other parts of mathematics), a Cartesian product is a mathematical operation that returns a set (or product set or simply product) from multiple sets. That is, for sets \"A\" and \"B\", the Cartesian product is the set of all ordered pairs where and . Products can be specified using set-builder notation, e.g.\n\nA table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form .\n\nMore generally, a Cartesian product of \"n\" sets, also known as an \"n\"-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an array of \"n\" dimensions, where each element is an \"n\"-tuple. An ordered pair is a 2-tuple or couple.\n\nThe Cartesian product is named after René Descartes, whose formulation of analytic geometry gave rise to the concept, which is further generalized in terms of direct product.\n\nAn illustrative example is the standard 52-card deck. The standard playing card ranks {A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} form a 13-element set. The card suits form a four-element set. The Cartesian product of these sets returns a 52-element set consisting of 52 ordered pairs, which correspond to all 52 possible playing cards. \n\nBoth sets are distinct, even disjoint.\n\nThe main historical example is the Cartesian plane in analytic geometry. In order to represent geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extract numerical information from shapes' numerical representations, René Descartes assigned to each point in the plane a pair of real numbers, called its coordinates. Usually, such a pair's first and second components are called its \"x\" and \"y\" coordinates, respectively (see picture). The set of all such pairs (i.e. the Cartesian product with ℝ denoting the real numbers) is thus assigned to the set of all points in the plane.\n\nA formal definition of the Cartesian product from set-theoretical principles follows from a definition of ordered pair. The most common definition of ordered pairs, the Kuratowski definition, is formula_2. Under this definition, formula_3 is an element of formula_4, and formula_5 is a subset of that set, where formula_6 represents the power set operator. Therefore, the existence of the Cartesian product of any two sets in ZFC follows from the axioms of pairing, union, power set, and specification. Since functions are usually defined as a special case of relations, and relations are usually defined as subsets of the Cartesian product, the definition of the two-set Cartesian product is necessarily prior to most other definitions.\n\nLet \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\" be sets.\n\nThe Cartesian product is not commutative,\nbecause the ordered pairs are reversed unless at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\nFor example:\n\nStrictly speaking, the Cartesian product is not associative (unless one of the involved sets is empty).\nIf for example \"A\" = {1}, then (\"A\" × \"A\") × \"A\" = { ((1,1),1) } ≠ { (1,(1,1)) } = \"A\" × (\"A\" × \"A\").\n\nThe Cartesian product behaves nicely with respect to intersections (see leftmost picture).\n\nIn most cases the above statement is not true if we replace intersection with union (see middle picture).\n\nIn fact, we have that:\n\nFor the set difference we also have the following identity:\n\nHere are some rules demonstrating distributivity with other operators (see rightmost picture):\nwhere formula_17 denotes the absolute complement of \"A\".\n\nOther properties related with subsets are:\n\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements of the set. For example, defining two sets: } and Both set \"A\" and set \"B\" consist of two elements each. Their Cartesian product, written as , results in a new set which has the following elements:\n\nEach element of \"A\" is paired with each element of \"B\". Each pair makes up one element of the output set.\nThe number of values in each element of the resulting set is equal to the number of sets whose cartesian product is being taken; 2 in this case.\nThe cardinality of the output set is equal to the product of the cardinalities of all the input sets.

If tuples are defined as nested ordered pairs, it can be identified with . If a tuple is defined as a function on that takes its value at \"i\" to be the \"i\"th element of the tuple, then the Cartesian product \"X\"×...×\"X\" is the set of functions\n\nThe Cartesian square of a set \"X\" is the Cartesian product .\nAn example is the 2-dimensional plane where R is the set of real numbers: R is the set of all points where \"x\" and \"y\" are real numbers (see the Cartesian coordinate system).\n\nThe \"n\"-ary Cartesian power of a set \"X\" can be defined as\n\nAn example of this is , with R again the set of real numbers, and more generally R.\n\nThe \"n\"-ary cartesian power of a set \"X\" is isomorphic to the space of functions from an \"n\"-element set to \"X\". As a special case, the 0-ary cartesian power of \"X\" may be taken to be a singleton set, corresponding to the empty function with codomain \"X\".\n\nIt is possible to define the Cartesian product of an arbitrary (possibly infinite) indexed family of sets. If \"I\" is any index set, and formula_23 is a family of sets indexed by \"I\", then the Cartesian product of the sets in \"X\" is defined to be \n\nthat is, the set of all functions defined on the index set such that the value of the function at a particular index \"i\" is an element of \"X\". Even if each of the \"X\" is nonempty, the Cartesian product may be empty if the axiom of choice (which is equivalent to the statement that every such product is nonempty) is not assumed.\n\nFor each \"j\" in \"I\", the function \ndefined by formula_26 is called the \"j\"th projection map.\n\nCartesian power is a Cartesian product where all the factors \"X\" are the same set \"X\". In this case, \nis the set of all functions from \"I\" to \"X\", and is frequently denoted \"X\". This case is important in the study of cardinal exponentiation. An important special case is when the index set is formula_28, the natural numbers: this Cartesian product is the set of all infinite sequences with the \"i\"th term in its corresponding set \"X\". For example, each element of \ncan be visualized as a vector with countably infinite real number components. This set is frequently denoted formula_30, or formula_31.\n\nIf several sets are being multiplied together, e.g. \"X\", \"X\", \"X\", …, then some authors choose to abbreviate the Cartesian product as simply ×\"X\".\n\nIf \"f\" is a function from \"A\" to \"B\" and \"g\" is a function from \"X\" to \"Y\", their Cartesian product is a function from to with\n\nThis can be extended to tuples and infinite collections of functions.\nThis is different from the standard cartesian product of functions considered as sets.\n\nLet formula_33 be a set and formula_34. Then the \"cylinder\" of formula_35 with respect to formula_33 is the Cartesian product formula_37 of formula_35 and formula_33. \n\nNormally, formula_33 is considered to be the universe of the context and is left away. For example, if formula_35 is a subset of the natural numbers formula_28, then the cylinder of formula_35 is formula_44.\n\nAlthough the Cartesian product is traditionally applied to sets, category theory provides a more general interpretation of the product of mathematical structures. This is distinct from, although related to, the notion of a Cartesian square in category theory, which is a generalization of the fiber product.\n\nExponentiation is the right adjoint of the Cartesian product; thus any category with a Cartesian product (and a final object) is a Cartesian closed category.\n\nIn graph theory the Cartesian product of two graphs \"G\" and \"H\" is the graph denoted by whose vertex set is the (ordinary) Cartesian product and such that two vertices (\"u\",\"v\") and (\"u\"′,\"v\"′) are adjacent in if and only if and \"v\" is adjacent with \"v\"′ in \"H\", \"or\" and \"u\" is adjacent with \"u\"′ in \"G\". The Cartesian product of graphs is not a product in the sense of category theory. Instead, the categorical product is known as the tensor product of graphs.\n\n\n"}

It ceased to exist in 1996.\n\nIn the years prior to the scandal, levels of reported child abuse in the Cleveland area were consistent with those of other parts of the United Kingdom. However, in 1987, during the period of February to July, many children living in Cleveland were removed from their homes by social service agencies and diagnosed as sexually abused. The 121 diagnoses were made by two paediatricians at a Middlesbrough hospital, Marietta Higgs and Geoffrey Wyatt, using the later-discredited diagnostic of reflex anal dilation. When there were not enough foster homes in which to place the allegedly abused children, social services began to house the children in a ward at the local hospital. \n\nLater, the test being used to establish child abuse was contested by the area police surgeon, and cooperation between the social workers, police and hospital doctors involved in diagnosis began to disintegrate. In addition, there was public concern regarding the practices being used by the local social service agency, such as the removal of children from their homes in the middle of the night. In May 1987, parents marched from the hospital where their children were being held to the local newspaper. The resulting media coverage caused the social service agency's practices to receive public scrutiny and criticism. In response, the Butler-Sloss report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Social Services in July 1987 and published in 1988. The report was led by Elizabeth Butler-Sloss and it concluded that most of the diagnoses were incorrect. As a result, 94 of the 121 children were returned to their homes.\n\nOn 14 October 1991, the Children Act 1989 was implemented in full as a result of the Cleveland child abuse scandal and other child related events that preceded it. A television documentary called \"The Death of Childhood\" was broadcast in 1997 and alleged that \"independent experts under the guidance of the Department of Health later found that at least 70 per cent of the diagnoses\" were correct. According to the documentary, two years after the scandal a number of children were again referred to social services and determined to be at risk for child abuse. In February 2007, the Chief Medical Officer, who was the regional medical officer at the time of the scandal, said that \"mistakes were made\" A few days later, two of the children who had been the focus of the scandal asked the Middlesbrough police for an investigation of their 1987 experience.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "389579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=389579", "title": "Cognitive neuropsychology", "text": "Cognitive neuropsychology\n\nCognitive neuropsychology is a branch of cognitive psychology that aims to understand how the structure and function of the brain relates to specific psychological processes. Cognitive psychology is the science that looks at how mental processes are responsible for our cognitive abilities to store and produce new memories, produce language, recognize people and objects, as well as our ability to reason and problem solve. Cognitive neuropsychology places a particular emphasis on studying the cognitive effects of brain injury or neurological illness with a view to inferring models of normal cognitive functioning. Evidence is based on case studies of individual brain damaged patients who show deficits in brain areas and from patients who exhibit double dissociations. Double dissociations involve two patients and two tasks. One patient is impaired at one task but normal on the other, while the other patient is normal on the first task and impaired on the other. For example, patient A would be poor at reading printed words while still being normal at understanding spoken words, while the patient B would be normal at understanding written words and be poor at understanding spoken words. Scientists can interpret this information to explain how there is a single cognitive module for word comprehension. From studies like these, researchers infer that different areas of the brain are highly specialised. Cognitive neuropsychology can be distinguished from cognitive neuroscience, which is also interested in brain damaged patients, but is particularly focused on uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes.\n\nCognitive neuropsychology has its roots in the diagram making approach to language disorder that started in the second half of the 19th century. The discovery that aphasia took different forms depending on the location of brain damage provided a powerful framework for understanding brain function.\n\nIn 1861 Paul Broca, reported a post mortem study of an aphasic patient who was speechless apart from a single nonsense word: \"Tan\". Broca showed that an area of the left frontal lobe was damaged. As Tan was unable to produce speech but could still understand it, Broca argued that this area might be specialised for speech production and that language skills might be localized to this cortical area. Broca did a similar study on another patient, Lelong, a few weeks later. Lelong, like Tan, could understand speech but could only repeat the same 5 words. After examining his brain, Broca noticed that Lelong had a lesion in approximately the same area as his patient Tan. He also noticed that in the more than 25 patients he examined with aphasia, they all had lesions to the left frontal lobe but there was no damage to the right hemisphere of the brain. From this he concluded that the function of speech was probably localized in the inferior frontal gyrus of the left hemisphere of the brain, an area now known as Broca's area.\n\nKarl Wernicke subsequently reported patients with damage further back in the temporal lobe who could speak but were unable to understand what was said to them, providing evidence for two potentially interconnected language centres. These clinical descriptions were integrated into a theory of language organisation by Lichtheim. Subsequently, these models were used and developed to inform Dejerine's account of reading, Liepmann's theory of action and Lissauer's 1890 account of object recognition and Lewandowsky and Stadelmann's 1908 account of calculation.\n\nHowever, the early 20th century saw a reaction to the overly-precise accounts of the diagram making neurologists. Pierre Marie challenged conclusions against previous evidence of Broca's areas in 1906 and Henry Head attacked the whole field of cerebral localisation 1926.\n\nThe modern science of cognitive neuropsychology emerged during the 1960s stimulated by the insights of the neurologist Norman Geschwind who demonstrated that the insights of Broca and Wernicke were still clinically relevant. The other stimulus to the discipline was the \"Cognitive Revolution\" and the growing science of cognitive psychology which had emerged as a reaction to behaviorism in the mid 20th century.\nPsychologists in the mid-1950s acknowledged that the structure of mental information-processing systems could be investigated in scientifically acceptable ways. They developed and applied new cognitive processing models to explain experimental data from not only studies of speech and language but also those of selective attention. Cognitive psychologists and clinical neuropsychologists developed more research collaborations to gain a better understanding of these disorders. The rebirth of neuropsychology was marked by the publishing of two seminal collaborative papers from Marshall & Newcombe (1966) on reading and Warrington & Shallice (1969) on memory. Subsequently, work by pioneers such as Elizabeth Warrington, Brenda Milner, Tim Shallice, Alan Baddeley and Lawrence Weiskrantz demonstrated that neurological patients were an important source of data for cognitive psychologists.\n\nIt took less than one decade for neuropsychology to be fully re-established. More achievements in neuropsychology were recognized: the establishment of the first major book discussing neuropsychology using a cognitive approach, \"Deep Dyslexia\", in 1980 after a scientific meeting about the topic in Oxford in 1977, the birth of the \"Cognitive Neuropsychology\" journal in 1984, and the publishing of the first textbook of neuropsychology, \"Human Cognitive Neuropsychology\" in 1988.\n\nA particular area of interest was memory. Patients with amnesia caused by injuries to the hippocampus in the temporal cortex and midbrain areas (especially the mamillary bodies were of early interest. A patient with severe case of amnesia will not be able to remember meeting the examiner if they leave the room and return, let alone events of the previous day (episodic memory), but they will still be able to learn how to tie their shoes (procedural memory), remember a series of numbers for a few seconds (short term memory or working memory) and be able to recall historical events they have learned in school (semantic memory). By contrast, patients may lose their short term memory abilities while retaining their long term memory functions. Many other studies like this have been done in the field of neuropsychology examining lesions and the effect they have on certain areas of the brain and their functions.\nStudies on the amnesic patient Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., are commonly cited as some of the precursors, if not the beginning of modern cognitive neuropsychology. Molaison had parts of his medial temporal lobes surgically removed to treat intractable epilepsy in 1953. Much of the hippocampus was also removed along with the medial temporal lobes. The treatment proved successful in reducing his dangerous seizures, but left him with a profound but selective amnesia. After the surgery, Molaison was able to remember some big events from before the surgery, such as the stock market crash in 1929, but was confused about many others and could no longer form new memories. This accidental experiment showed scientists how the brain processes different types of memory. Because Molaison's impairment was caused by surgery, the damaged parts of his brain were known, information which was usually not knowable in a time before accurate neuroimaging became widespread. Scientists concluded that while the hippocampus is needed in the creation of new memories, it is not needed in the retrieval of old ones; they are two separate processes. They also realized that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobes, both of the areas removed from Molaison, are the areas responsible for converting short term memory to long term memory.\n\nMuch of the early work of cognitive neuropsychology was carried out with limited reference to the detailed localisation of brain pathology. Neuroimaging was relatively imprecise and other anatomically based techniques were also limited. The emphasis of many researchers as late as 1990 was on the analysis of patterns of cognitive deficit rather than on where the injury was located. Despite the lack of detailed anatomical data, studies of reading, language and memory had a number of important implications. The first is that certain cognitive processes (such as language) could be damaged separately from others, and so might be handled by distinct and independent cognitive (and neural) processes. (For more on the cognitive neuropsychological approach to language, see Eleanor Saffran, among others.) The second is that such processes might be localized to specific areas of the brain. Whilst both of these claims are still controversial to some degree, the influence led to a focus on brain injury as a potentially fruitful way of understanding the relationship between psychology and neuroscience.\n\nA key approach within cognitive neuropsychology has been to use single case studies and dissociation as a means of testing theories of cognitive function. For example, if a theory states that reading and writing are simply different skills stemming from a single cognitive process, it should not be possible to find a person who, after brain injury, can write but not read or read but not write. This selective breakdown in skills suggests that different parts of the brain are specialized for the different processes and so the cognitive systems are separable.\n\nThe philosopher Jerry Fodor has been particularly influential in cognitive neuropsychology, particularly with the idea that the mind, or at least certain parts of it, may be organised into independent modules. Evidence that cognitive skills may be damaged independently seem to support this theory to some degree, although it is clear that some aspects of mind (such as belief for example) are unlikely to be modular. Fodor, a strict functionalist, rejects the idea that the neurological properties of the brain have any bearing on its cognitive properties and doubts the whole discipline of cognitive neuropsychology.\n\nWith improved neuroimaging techniques, it has been possible to correlate patterns of impairment with a knowledge of exactly which parts of the nervous system are damaged, allowing previously undiscovered functional relationships to be explored (the \"lesion method\"). Contemporary cognitive neuropsychology uses many of the same techniques and technologies from the wider science of neuropsychology and fields such as cognitive neuroscience. These may include neuroimaging, electrophysiology and neuropsychological tests to measure either brain function or psychological performance. Useful technology in cognitive neuropsychology includes positron-emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques make it possible to identify the areas of the brain responsible for performing certain cognitive tasks by measuring blood flow in the brain. PET scans sense the low-level radiation in the brain and produce 3-D images, whereas an fMRI works on a magnetic signal and is used to “map the brain”. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical activity and can identify changes that occur over milliseconds. EEG is often used in patients with epilepsy to detect seizure activity.\n\nThe principles of cognitive neuropsychology have recently been applied to mental illness, with a view to understanding, for example, what the study of delusions may tell us about the function of normal belief. This relatively young field is known as cognitive neuropsychiatry.\n"}

Because their main job qualification was fluency in Russian, crown rabbis were typically considered agents of the state by members of their own communities, not true rabbis, and they often had no education in or knowledge of Jewish law.\n\nThe origins of the crown rabbinate in Imperial Russia date to the early 19th century and administrative requirements by the tsar that the Jewish community maintain and provide civil records to the Imperial government in the Russian language.\n\nThe Russian government viewed all permissible religions as agents of the state. Russian Orthodox priests, Mennonite ministers, Catholics as well as Jewish rabbiswere all required to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, deaths, and marriages, as well as other duties. The Russians found this arrangement useful, and employed designated members of these religious communities at a tiny salary (which could be augmented by bribes by the ambitious) to perform these official functions.\n\nUkases by Tsar Alexander I (reigned 18011825) required the rabbis to maintain civil information in Russian as well as Hebrew. Rabbis in the Empire all spoke Hebrew and Yiddish, but few could speak Russian or other languages considered useful by the Empire such as German and Polish. For this reason, the Jewish communities chose an individual familiar with Russian and other required languages to perform this role, and put his name forward. If approved by the governmental administration, they became \"official\" rabbis, in the sense that they acted as the intermediary between their community and the Imperial government for the required civil and other administrative duties the government required of them.\n\nSince rabbis most often did not speak Russian, the men put forth by the community typically were men who were not rabbis, and often they were not even particularly familiar with Jewish law. Because of this, they were looked down upon by their communities as agents or puppets of the government, and not real rabbis, despite the title accorded them by the state.\n\nThis new position became more formalized under Tsar Nicholas I (reigned 18251855). In 1835, new laws established these appointees as employees and officials of the Imperial government. While continuing their record-keeping duties as before, they were also now given religious authority by the state and were also to maintain loyalty to the state among their community. It was under these new regulations that those occupying these official posts came to be called \"crown rabbis\".\n\nA crown rabbi was either appointed, or elected by members of the Jewish community in which he resided. In Kiev, shortly after Jewish residents were permitted to settle in the city in 1861, a crown rabbi was appointed. But the local community objected, and wished to elect someone with the education and stature that they could respect, and elected their own man, Evsei Tsukkerman, instead. He was then approved by the government, and took up the position of crown rabbi.\n\nThe crown rabbinate evolved, and by mid-century the government opened its own seminaries for training rabbis (supported by taxes on Jewish communities) with a strong secular syllabus promoting the interests of the state. The training was seven years undergraduate, followed by three years training in pedagogy or rabbinical studies. Secular subjects were mandatory; the syllabus did include Rabbinic training (Talmud, halakha) at the graduate level, but was optional and few graduates took it.\n\nThe first graduates emerged in the 1850s, and by the following decade, new laws were passed obliging the Jewish communities to hire these graduates, although there was a lot of resistance to them as they were viewed as poorly or uneducated in Jewish matters important to the community, and a bad influence because of their years of secular indoctrination. Few graduates found positions, and the number of them graduating went down to a trickle. Finally, the government closed the schools down in 1873, realizing that the Jewish community regarded them as unfit for the honored position of rabbi. The position of crown rabbi outlasted the schools, and while the government viewed the crown rabbis as being the only official rabbis, the communities continued to have rabbis schooled in the traditional ways, with the result that many communities had two rabbis, an \"official\" one for dealing with the Tsar, and a \"spiritual\" rabbi for dealing with all the traditional religious and family roles that rabbis usually dealt with. The official rabbis were universally viewed as agents of the state by the Jewish communities.\n\nThe problem of the \"dual rabbinate\" continued until the 20th century and World War I, with debates raging within the community itself about how to view and react to the situation. The Orthodox accepted only their traditional spiritual rabbis as legitimate, while progressive Jews thought that rabbis should also play a role in secular concerns such as social, economic, and intellectual aspects of their communities. Crown rabbis continued to perform their official duties all during this debate, and attended various Russian Rabbinic Congresses, such as the one in 1910.\n\nAt the 1910 Rabinic conference the objective was to get rid of the Crown Rabbinate entirely, but this ran into problems because the Orthodox delegates by and large refused to encourage or require their (legitimate, spiritual, educated) rabbis to take on the administrative tasks fulfilled by the crown rabbis because that would require their learning Russian and to submit to the licensing authority of the Russian state which was far too much in the secular domain for an Orthodox rabbi to go. This caused a split among the delegates among those who saw nothing wrong with learning Russian and even thought it would avoid much of the misery the Jews had undergone, however this resulted in a stalemate and no new decisions were taken about it.\n\nVarious men who became well known in the Jewish community initially served as a crown rabbi.\n\n\n"}

The original lyricist and the composer are unknown, though the most popular version was rendered by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in 1842.\n\nThe idea represented in the title—that thoughts are free—was expressed as early as in antiquity and became prominent again in the Middle Ages, when Walther von der Vogelweide (c.1170–1230) wrote: (\"yet still thoughts are free\"). In the 12th century, it is thought that Austrian minnesinger Dietmar von Aist composed the song \"\" (\"only thoughts are free\"). About 1229, Freidank wrote: (\"this band may no one twine, that will my thoughts confine\").\n\nThe text as it first occurred on leaflets about 1780 originally had four strophes, to which a fifth was later added. Today, their order may vary. An early version in the shape of a dialogue between a captive and his beloved was published under the title \"\" (\"Song of the persecuted in the tower. After Swiss songs\") in Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano's circa 1805 folk poetry collection , Vol. III.\n\nThe text and the melody can be found in (songs of the girls from Brienz), printed in Bern, Switzerland, between 1810 and 1820. It was adopted by Hoffmann von Fallersleben in his (Silesian folk songs with melodies) collection published by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1842, who referred to it as \"from Neukirch bei Schönau\".\n\nThe rhyme scheme of the lyrics is a – B / a – B / C – C / d – d where capital letters indicate two-syllable feminine rhymes.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\relative c\" {\n\\addlyrics {\n\\midi {\n</score>\n\nSince the days of the Carlsbad Decrees and the Age of Metternich, \"Die Gedanken sind frei\" was a popular protest song against political repression and censorship, especially among the banned Burschenschaften student fraternities. In the aftermath of the failed 1848 German Revolution the song was banned. The Achim/Brentano text was given a new musical setting for voice and orchestra by Gustav Mahler in his 1898 \"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\" collection.\n\nThe song was important to certain anti-Nazi resistance movements in Germany. In 1942, Sophie Scholl, a member of the White Rose resistance group, played the song on her flute outside the walls of Ulm prison, where her father Robert had been detained for calling the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler a \"scourge of God\". Earlier, in 1935, the guards at the Lichtenburg concentration camp had ordered prisoners to stage a performance in celebration of Hitler's 46th birthday; the imprisoned communist-friendly lawyer Hans Litten recited \"Die Gedanken sind frei\" in response.\n\nThe Weavers recorded the song at a live concert in the 1950s. Pete Seeger also recorded the song, solo, back in the 1950s. The Limeliters recorded the song in 1962 on their \"Folk Matinee\" album. Pete Seeger recorded the song once more in his \"Dangerous Songs!?\" album in 1966. Norwegian composer Alf Cranner translated and recorded it as \"\" in 1985. Parts of the poem were also taken as the basis of a song by the Brazilian Girls on their self-titled 2005 album.\n\n\"Die Gedanken sind frei\" was used as the theme and was sung by the Allied prisoners of war in the 1971 TV movie \"The Birdmen\", which was a fictionalized dramatization of an attempt to escape from the German Oflag IV-C camp at Colditz Castle in World War II. It was featured in the 1998 German movie \"23\" about the hacker Karl Koch. This melody was played by a violinist in the film \"The Book Thief\".\n\nIn Canadian author Jean Little's 1972 book \"From Anna\" the song is used to represent the freedom the titular character's father craves for his children, and as such figures predominantly into the plot at the beginning of the novel.\n\n\"Die Gedanken sind frei\" is a track by the German band Megaherz on their \"Wer Bist Du?\" album.\n\nThe text of \"Die Gedanken sind frei\" has been used in the video game Orwell as a plot device.\n\n"}

It is a popular notion, which may have contributed to the tathagatagarbha doctrine, although the notion of an \"eternal Buddha\" is not explicitly stated in the Lotus Sutra.\n\nThe belief in the Eternal Buddha transcends through time and is commonly associated with Shakyamuni Buddha, but can also refer to both his past and future incarnations. However, no exact definition of the \"Eternal Buddha\" is defined in the Lotus Sutra, which was also revealed by Siddhartha Gautama; thereby making open interpretations to various religious groups.\n\nIn east-Asian Buddhism, the Buddha of the Lotus Sutra is regarded as the eternal Buddha. \"The Tathagata´s Lifespan\" chapter (ch 16) of the Lotus Sutra portrays the Buddha as indicating that he became awakened countless aeons (\"kalpas\") ago. The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase \"eternal Buddha\". \n\nIn China the \"Lotus Sutra\" was associated with the \"Mahaparinirvana Sutra\", which propagates the tathagatagarbha-doctrine, and with the \"Awakening of Faith\". The Mahaparinirvana Sutra presents the Buddha as eternal, and equates him with the Dharmakaya. \n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" itself does hardly seem to accept the tathagatagarbha-teachings. According to Paul Williams, this association may be explained by the systematization of the \"Lotus Sutra\" teachings by the Tiantai school, using teachings from other schools \"to equate the Buddha of the \"Lotus Sutra\" with the ultimate truth and to teach a cosmic Buddha.\"\n\nThe Chinese Tiantai scholar Zhiyi [天台] (538–597) divided the sutra into the \"trace teaching\" about the historical Shakyamuni Buddha (ch 1-14) and the \"origin teaching\" (ch 15-28) revealing the original Buddha of inconceivable life span. \nZhiyi viewed Shakyamuni Buddha of Ch 16 of the Lotus Sutra as a unification of the three Buddha bodies, possessing all three bodies, whereas other sutras are taught from the standpoint of a single Buddha body.\n\nThe Nichiren Shu, Rissho Kosei Kai and Kempon Hokke schools of Nichiren Buddhism revere Shakyamuni of Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra as the eternal Buddha. They also regard Shakyamuni of Ch 16 as a \"Unification of the Three Bodies\", as taught by Tiantai. Other Buddhas, such as Amida of the Pure Land (J. Nembutsu) School, and Mahavairochana of the True Word (J. Shingon) School are seen as provisional manifestations of the Original Buddha Shakyamuni.\n\nIn Shin or Pure Land Buddhism, Amida Buddha is viewed as the eternal Buddha who manifested as Shakyamuni in India and who is the personification of Nirvana itself.\n\nShingon Buddhism sees Vairochana Buddha as the personification of the dharmakaya, and hence as the eternal Buddha.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9855", "title": "Exile", "text": "Exile\n\nTo be in exile means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.\n\nIn Roman law, \"exsilium\" denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.\n\nThe terms diaspora and refugee describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and \"government in exile\" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.\n\nArticle 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"\n\nIn some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.\n\nA wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a \"tax exile\". Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels \"Hotel\" and \"Airport\", and the English rock band the Rolling Stones who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called \"Exile on Main Street\", the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera. In 2012, Eduardo Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's IPO. The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act, which would have forced such wealthy \"tax exiles\" to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.\n\nIn some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for 17 years rather than face prosecution in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company Polly Peck in the United Kingdom.\n\nExamples include:\n\nIt is an alternative theory recently developed by a young anthropologist, Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable exile is a “social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society. Such people are considered “aliens” or internal “others” on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.” \n\nWhen a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or \"diaspora\". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Jews, who were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.\n\nAfter the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like Kościuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russian Empire, Prussia and Austro-Hungary), many Poles have chosen – or been forced – to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of Crimean Tatars (200,000) that remained in their homeland Crimea was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing and collective punishment on false accusations. At Diego Garcia, between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 Chagossian resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.\n\nSince the Cuban Revolution over one million Cubans have left Cuba. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the Cuban Revolution, Cuba only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be Cuban exiles. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.\n\nDuring a foreign occupation or after a coup d'état, a \"government in exile\" of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the Free French Forces government of Charles De Gaulle of the same time, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai Lama.\n\nExile is an early motif in ancient Greek tragedy. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play \"Medea\", written by Euripides in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of Greek mythology. Euripides’ Medea has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.\n\nAfter Medea was abandoned by Jason and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king Aigeus there, and became the stepmother of the hero Theseus. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the Polis and go away into exile. John William Waterhouse (1849–1917), the English Pre-Raphaelite painter’s famous picture \"Jason and Medea\" shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work \"Tristia\" (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.\nAnother, at least in a temporary exile, was Dante.\n\nThe German language writer of novels, Franz Kafka, called \"the Dante of the twentieth century\" by the poet W. H. Auden, describes the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel \"Amerika\".\n\nDuring the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and Anna Seghers. So Germany’s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit. Klaus Mann finished his novel \"\" (\"The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants\") in 1939 describing the German exile scene, \"to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form\", as he wrote in his literary balance sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel \"Das siebte Kreuz\" (\"The Seventh Cross\", published in the United States in 1942).\n\nImportant exile literatures in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott as well as the novelists Edwidge Danticat and Sam Selvon.\n\n\n"}

For smooth manifolds, integration of forms gives a natural homomorphism from the de Rham cohomology to the singular cohomology over .

{"id": "1188453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1188453", "title": "Fate (role-playing game system)", "text": "Fate (role-playing game system)\n\nFate is a generic role-playing game system based on the \"Fudge\" gaming system. It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is customizable. It is designed to offer minimal obstruction to role-playing by assuming players want to make fewer dice rolls.\n\n\"Fate\" was written by Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue; the 1st edition was published in early 2003, and the latest version (4th edition) was published successfully through crowd sourcing Kickstarter in 2013. \"Fate\" gained adherents both for its high level of support, which is unusual for a free game, and for the numerous innovative gaming mechanics.\n\nFate is derived from the \"Fudge\" system, primarily that earlier design's verbal scale and Fudge dice, but most versions of Fate eschew the use of mandatory traits such as Strength and Intelligence. Instead, it uses a long list of skills and assumes that every character is \"mediocre\" in all skills except those that the character is explicitly defined as being good at. Skills may perform one or more of the four actions: attacking, defending, overcoming obstacles (a catch-all for solving problems) or creating an advantage (see below). Exceptional abilities are defined through the use of \"Stunts\" and \"Aspects\".\n\nAn aspect is a free form descriptor of something notable about either the character or the scene. A relevant aspect can be invoked to grant a bonus to a die roll (either adding +2, or allowed a re-roll of the dice); this usually costs the player or GM a fate point. Aspects may also be compelled to influence the setting by offering the person with the aspect a fate point (which they can refuse by spending one of their own) to put them at a disadvantage relevant to the aspect. An example given in the rule book refers to the GM invoking a player character's \"Rivals in the Collegia Arcana\" aspect to have said rivals attack them in the bath so they don't have access to their equipment. Situational aspects describe the scene, and may be created and used by the GM, or by players using the create advantage action with a relevant skill.\n\nStunts are exceptional abilities that grant the character a specific mechanical benefit; these may be drawn from a pre-defined list of stunts included in the rules, or created following guidelines provided by the authors. Aspects, on the other hand, are always defined by the player. For example, a player may choose to give their character an aspect of \"Brawny\" (or \"Muscle Man\" or \"Wiry Strength\"); during play, the player may invoke those aspects to gain a temporary bonus in a relevant situation. Aspects may also relate to a character's possessions, e.g. the character Indiana Jones for example, might have the Aspect \"Whip and Fedora\".\n\nWhen the system was originally published FATE was considered an acronym for “Fudge Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment” and then “Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment”. Most recently \"FATE\" has been simplified to just be \"Fate\" and is no longer an acronym.\n\nWhile there has been concern that \"Fudge\" would restrict its \"open\" license and thus force \"Fate\" to change to a different underlying mechanic, such fears have subsided once \"Fudge\" itself was released under the Open Gaming License. \"Fate\" has an associated Yahoo! Group to discuss the gaming system and share settings and conversions of other role-playing games.\n\nThe 3rd edition of \"Fate\" was no longer a generic RPG like the first two versions, but set in the pulp genre. It is called Spirit of the Century and was nominated in 2007 for an ENnie award for \"Best Rules\". The 3rd edition rules also are used for the \"Dresden Files\" role-playing game. The System Reference Documents for \"Spirit of the Century\" and \"Diaspora\" are also currently available. Several other role-playing games are built on the game mechanics of \"Fate 3.0\".\n\nA new (4th) edition called \"Fate Core\" (again a generic version) was published in 2013, funded by a successful crowdfunding campaign, and released under two free content licenses: CC BY 3.0 and the Open gaming license.\n\nAs a result of the crowd funding effort, Evil Hat Productions released \"Fate Accelerated\", a streamlined version of the rules based on the same core mechanic intended to get players into the game faster. One notable difference is that skills are replaced with six \"approaches\" to solving problems - Careful, Clever, Flashy, Forceful, Quick, and Sneaky. The approaches can each use all four skill actions.\n\nTo release the new version of Fate, Evil Hat Productions ran a Kickstarter campaign that initially asked for $3,000. At the end of the campaign they raised $433,365 and expanded the product line significantly, adding two world books and a system toolkit.\n\nThis list includes implementations of the Fate system as well as RPGs explicitly inspired by it.\n\nIn the 2003 Indie RPG Awards, \"Fate\" won a number of awards:\n\n\nThe Fate roleplaying game has resulted in winning the following ENNIES awards:\n\n"}
{"id": "9164577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9164577", "title": "Free speech fights", "text": "Free speech fights\n\nFree speech fights are struggles over free speech, and especially those struggles which involved the Industrial Workers of the World and their attempts to gain awareness for labor issues by organizing workers and urging them to use their collective voice. During the World War I period in the United States, the IWW members (referred to as Wobblies), engaged in free speech fights over labor issues which were closely connected to the developing industrial world as well as the Socialist Party. The Wobblies, along with other radical groups, were often met with opposition (violent and otherwise) from local governments and especially business leaders, in their free speech fights.\n\nThe IWW organized transient workers (especially in cities in the American West) who worked in highly seasonal jobs—they met on the streets, discussed contemporary issues, and listened to speakers; at the time, it was a very popular method of organization. The events often ended with the police arresting them for participating in street meetings. The most notorious of all of the free speech fights was the San Diego free speech fight, which won a significant amount of public awareness for the IWW as it involved tremendous violence against the labor groups organized by the IWW. which brought the IWW to the greater notice of the American public and was notable for the intensity of violence by anti-labor vigilantes directed at the IWW; this violence included the kidnapping and tarring and feathering of Ben Reitman, who was a physician, and was Emma Goldman's lover.\n\nMore generally, a free speech fight is any incident in which a group is involved in a conflict over its speech. For instance, the Free Speech Movement, which began with a conflict on the Berkeley Campus in California in the 1960s, was a \"free speech fight\".\n\nThe IWW engaged in free speech fights during the period from approximately 1907 to 1916. The \"Wobblies\", as the IWW members were called, relied upon free speech, which in the United States is guaranteed by the First Amendment, to enable them to communicate the concept of One Big Union to other workers. In communities where the authorities saw their interests in avoiding the development of unions, the practice of soapboxing was frequently restricted by ordinance or by police harassment. The IWW employed a variety of creative tactics, including the tactic of flooding the area of a free speech fight with \"footloose rebels\" who would challenge the authorities by flouting the ordinance, intentionally getting arrested in great numbers. With the jails full and a seemingly endless stream of union activists arriving by boxcar and highway, the local communities frequently rescinded their prohibitions on free speech, or came to some other accommodation.\n\nThe Free Speech League, a progressive group which functioned at the same time as (and occasionally together with) the IWW, worked in conjunction with the IWW prior to World War I in many of their free speech fights, which generated a good deal of controversy. The free speech fights of the IWW were highly publicized, as they were designed to garner attention: they frequently started when local communities interjected to attempt to prevent the IWW from occupying street corners from which they would use provocative language to detail their radical beliefs. The free speech fights began occurring in 1906 and drew to a close by 1917—over that period of time, at least 26 communities played host to the IWW's free speech fights, and the years of 1909 to 1913 were particularly active, with at least 21 free speech fights happening.\n\nThe IWW members who engaged in the free speech fights typically cited the First Amendment and the rights guaranteed therein as proof positive of the validity of their cause, thereby highlighting the legal importance of the issues they fought for. That being the case, their struggles did not go unanswered or ignored: local, state, and even the federal government were prompted to respond, while, perhaps more importantly, the American public, due to the national publicity garnered by the free speech fights, were invariably tasked with confronting free speech issues. Practically all realms of American life were impacted by the free speech fights, as members of the press, church officials, school teachers, politicians, anyone involved in the business and labor world, and members of any organization (especially those of the Socialist Party) had a stake in the fights and thus attempted to comment on the issues in contention.\n\nFrom its inception, the IWW was deeply committed to free speech issues, and especially those affiliated with labor groups. The IWW formed in 1905 in response to dissatisfaction with the trade unions promoted by the American Federation of Labor (the AFL). Whereas the AFL promoted the ideals of capitalism by fighting for the rights of workers within the ideological framework of the free market system, the IWW functioned on anarchistic principles. Rather than urging workers to join unions based on craft and skill that were determined to form binding trade agreements with employers, the IWW advocated for the development of broad unions for low-skill workers that would be driven by the workers themselves (and their collective actions) rather than by top-down politics and binding capitalist decisions.\n\nThe primary vehicles of change for the free speech fights of the IWW were spontaneous workplace strikes as well as on-site labor slowdowns in addition to picketing, parades, and demonstrations. Importantly, the IWW engaged in street corner public displays and speaking to raise the public awareness regarding free speech fights. The desire for direct action by laborers was attributed to having grown disaffected with the beliefs of the AFL. They stressed their truly American origins and likened their actions to those of earlier American revolutionaries and activists.\n\nThe free speech fights of the IWW were often quite similar in nature: Wobblies (many of whom travelled across the country to spread their message) would visit a city's downtown and attempt to speak on soapboxes on street corners. Their message and their tactics were particularly provocative, and they were frequently arrested—though, if they were not arrested on one street corner, they would simply pack up and head to another one. \nAmong the offences which they were arrested for were blocking traffic, vagrancy, unlawful assembly, or violating local ordinances such as ones against speaking on the streets.\n\nThough the IWW was successful in many of their free speech fights, they did not always achieve their desired goals. In San Diego, for instance, they were unable to cause the repeal of a restrictive street ordinance while, in Paterson, they failed to gain protection for street picketing and meetings.\n\nThe ideology of the Wobblies who fought for free speech rights across America was deeply indebted to their core beliefs regarding the provenance of the First Amendment rights of the Constitution. In their estimation, they were fighting with the Constitution on their side while those who opposed them, such as city officials, were disregarding the fundamental laws of the country. The Wobblies frequently used phrases such as \"Have you ever read the Constitution?\" and \"What is this, Czarist Russia, or Free America?\"\n\nThe Wobblies held that the free speech rights granted by the First Amendment had been abridged over time, and they felt that it nowhere more evident than it was in the case of the laborers for whom they worked tirelessly—capitalism had conspired with the judicial system in the United States to deny agency and the Constitutionally-granted freedom of speech to American laborers. Not all Wobblies subscribed to such idealistic ideology, though, since some argued the more pessimistic belief that the Constitution had been written by the elites and that free speech was merely an illusion that worked to uphold the power of those same elites.\nBy adopting aggressive tactics which flaunted local ordinances against free speech, the Wobblies courted arrest, which they used as a demonstration of how far the abridgement of free speech had come. The official attempts to silence the IWW in the free speech fights, they argued, were totally opposed to the spirit of the First Amendment.\n\nAccording to the Wobblies, the fact that they even had to fight for free speech rights was evidence of the corrupting effect of capitalism in America and of its legal system. They argued that the Constitution was not being applied to American laborers, just as it had not been applied to slaves in the century prior. Rather than take their fights to the courts, which they felt were substantially corrupted by capitalist influence, they took their fight to the streets and urged other Americans to do the same.\n\nThe publications of the IWW urged people to \"Educate, Agitate, Organize!!!\" which led their opponents to see the fights for free speech as precursors to more insidious desires such as those for unionization and, especially, for the abolition of capitalism.\n\nThe free speech fights of the IWW were an inherently populist in nature. They were met with a variety of different public response and reactions: some supported their efforts and sought to collaborate with them while others engaged in vigilante violence against them (as was especially the case in San Diego). The free speech fights gained mass support from political groups such as labor unions, Socialists, and also the Free Speech League. Notably, few of the groups stood fast with the IWW when it came to their calls for revolution or for the overthrowing of capitalism more generally, and instead focused on the importance of the free speech rights for their own inherent worth to Americans. The AFL, though, opposed the IWW's efforts in the free speech realm from the get go. Other groups and members of the public, too, began to oppose the free speech fights over time because of the aggressive tactics and language among other things.\n\nThe Socialists were the most closely connected allies of the IWW in the free speech fights, as they had suffered through many years of free speech repression already and thus helped to fundraise for the cause and occasional even took part in the fights.\n\nLabor unions also offered significant support to the free speech fight cause since they had a stake in the fights. Important support, still, came from the American public at large.\n\nThe most notable proponent of the free speech fights in the official arena was New York City Police Commissioner Arthur Woods, who argued that all American groups should be granted the right of free speech and assembly. Rather than repress their constitutional rights, Woods felt that it was the duty of the police to protect the demonstrators. His personal philosophy dictated that free speech could be regulated only in ways that protected it through the creation of channels of expression which would not impede the rights of others.\n\nThe reasonable regulation of street speaking was an important issue that arose because of the free speech fights of the IWW. Their soapboxing on downtown street corners proved especially divisive. Whereas IWW supporters held that freedom of expression was especially important in the areas where that expression could actually reach the people (such as laborers) who would benefit the most from their message, opponents argued that their right to free speech did not belong in such public places where their incendiary tactics could be harmful to the public. Public streets were the best means of reaching the workers to whom their free speech fights were addressed, and the Wobblies did not always possess the necessary funds to rent out public assembly halls, for instance, from which they could exercise their right to free speech. \nThe IWW conceded, nonetheless, that reasonable restrictions should be placed on public speaking.\n\nThe struggle over free speech on downtown street corners was regarded as absurd by many people, since there were myriad other areas in the public sphere that allowed outdoor speaking to take place—downtown street corners, though, were outlawed. The fight over the street corners, therefore, became a symbol of the divisive ideology of the IWW—their opponents scornfully argued that the street corners were important to the Wobblies only because they could not reach an audience elsewhere since nobody would willingly attend any of their speeches.\n\nMany of the opponents of free speech fights, thus, were in favor of the establishment of centrally located areas that permitted oration but did not interfere with the city. Others, though, were totally opposed to the right to speak in public.\n\nThe IWW occasionally saw its fight over the regulation of street speaking extend to the judicial realm. More often than not, judges upheld the street ordinances that prevented public speaking. Notably, a judge in San Diego upheld the city's ordinance, and used the language of a similar decision in Los Angeles to explain that \"This ordinance does not attempt to suppress freedom of speech, or seek to interfere with the citizen in the right to express his views upon any subject, political, religious, or otherwise, as is suggested by the petitioner. It simply specifies a certain district within the city wherein no one may do the things prohibited.\"\n\nOne of the key themes of the free speech fights came from the regulation of speaking on the streets and involved discussions over the importance of access to public property and how reasonable limitations could be applied to it. People who debated the free speech fights frequently focused on the distinction between legal speech and illegal action while also detailing the various types of unprotected speech. They also debated what types of criticisms of the government should be protected by free speech.\n\nOne of the primary issues with the debates surrounding the free speech fights was that commentators understood that certain types of speech should be regarded as illegal and were not covered as free speech—sedition, libel, inciting speech, and obscenity fell into this category of speech, yet what some regarded as obscenity or libel, others regarded simply as government criticism that should be protected by the Constitution.\n\nIn \"A History of American Labor\", Joseph G. Rayback has written,\n\n[The Industrial Workers of the World] made its first impression upon the nation through its involvement in the \"free speech\" fight begun in Spokane, Washington, employment center for the casual labor elements of the Pacific Northwest. The fight developed late in 1908 when the I.W.W. launched an extensive speaking campaign with the slogan \"Don't Buy Jobs\" in the streets around the Spokane employment agencies which had become skilled in the art of swindling men who applied for jobs.\n\nThe \"job sharks\" were so closely tied to the crew boss on many job sites that there would be \"one gang coming, one gang working and one gang going.\" The faster the turnover, the greater the fees that could be generated. From time to time the men would ignore the IWW and seek revenge after an employment shark took someone's last dollar for a job that didn't exist. The \"Spokesman-Review\" of January 18, 1909 reported,\n\nHurling rocks and chunks of ice through the windows of the Red Cross Employment Agency, 224 Stevens St., several members of a noisy mob of between 2,000 and 3,000 idle men were about to attempt to wreck the place about 6 o'clock last evening, when James H. Walsh, organizer of the IWW, mounted a chair and pacified the multitude. In the opinion of the police had it not been for the intervention of Walsh, a riot would surely have followed, as the rabble was worked up to such a pitch that its members would have readily attempted violence. Walsh discouraged violence and summoned all members of the IWW to their hall at the rear of 312 Front Ave. The police dispersed the rest... At the hall Walsh warned the crowd against an outbreak. \"There were a lot of hired Pinkertons in that crowd,\" he said. \"All they wanted you fellows to do was to start something and then they would have an excuse for shooting you down or smashing your heads in... You can gain nothing by resorting to mob rule.\"\n\nFor the rest of the summer, IWW street meetings brought more and more working stiffs into the IWW.\n\nThe agencies promptly countered by pressuring the city council to pass an ordinance forbidding street speaking. The I.W.W. obeyed the regulation for nearly a year, until Spokane religious groups, which habitually used the streets, secured a new regulation exempting them from the street-speaking ordinance. Angered by the discrimination on behalf of \"the Christers,\" the Spokane I.W.W. renewed its campaign.\nThe newspaper of the IWW, the \"Industrial Worker\", published the following on October 28: \"Wanted—Men to Fill the Jails of Spokane.\" Then the IWW sent out a notice to all locations, \"Nov. 2, FREE SPEECH DAY—IWW locals will be notified by wire how many men to send if any... Meetings will be orderly and no irregularities of any kind will be tolerated.\"\n\nIn one day 150 men were arrested and crowded into jails that could hardly accommodate them. Reinforcements promptly arrived from the surrounding territory.\n\nThe Spokane City Council arranged for rock-pile work for the prisoners.\n\nAt the end of twenty days four hundred men had been jailed.\n\nOverflowing prisoners were lodged in the Franklin School [then located along Front Street (now Trent)], and the War Department made Fort Wright available for more. Eight editors in succession got out a copy of the \"Industrial Worker\", and then took their turn soapboxing, and went to jail. The IWW's \"rebel girl,\" Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who was fresh out of high school, delayed her arrest by chaining herself to a lamppost. She later charged that the police were using the women's section of the jail as a brothel, with police soliciting customers. When that story was printed in the \"Industrial Worker\" on December 10, the police attempted to destroy all copies. Public sympathy began to favor the strikers. When the prison guards would march the overflowing prisoners through the streets to bathing facilities, crowds would shower the men with apples, oranges, and Cigarettes.\n\nThe effort brought results: the W.F.M. declared a boycott of all goods coming from Spokane, and taxpayers began to protest against the cost of feeding, housing, and policing the prisoners. When Vincent St. John publicly appealed to all Wobblies to come to Spokane to renew the struggle, city officials capitulated.\n\nThe victory for the free speech fight came on March 4. The licenses of 19 of the employment agencies were revoked.\n\nThe I.W.W. was granted freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and the right to distribute its literature.\n\nIn \"Labor's Untold Story\", Boyer and Morais observed,\n\nThe courts became so clogged they could handle little else but free speech cases. The fight for free speech became largely a question of endurance between the lungs and heads of the Wobblies and the stamina of the police. In Missoula and Spokane as in most of the other towns where free speech fights were waged, any citizen could address any assemblage on any street on any subject at any time by the end of 1912.\n\nThe IWW members won a free speech fight in Missoula when, on October 8, 1909, the city council decided to let the union members speak anywhere in the community, so long as they did not impede traffic.\n\nElizabeth Gurley Flynn was \"a striking auburn-haired 19-year-old\" when she arrived in Missoula with her husband, Jack Jones in September 1909. At Higgins Avenue and West Front Street, the Wobblies set up a soapbox. On September 22, Frank Little arrived to assist. Little and Jones were arrested on September 29. A young logger and a civil engineer then spoke, and were likewise arrested. Flynn put out the word, declaring, \"we need volunteers to go to jail.\" Wobblies poured in from the surrounding territory, flooding the jail. They sang IWW songs, and shouted Wobbly slogans.\n\nAccording to Flynn, who also was arrested, the jail was \"a filthy, dirty hole under the firehouse stable, where all the filthy excrement of the place pours down upon the prisoners.\" Yet enough Wobblies submitted themselves to arrest—frequently just before dinner time—that the city was feeling the impact of the Wobbly tactic. After a night in jail, Wobblies were often offered their freedom before breakfast, but many refused to be released, instead demanding a jury trial.\n\nThe Western Montana Apple Show was set to open, and Missoula officials decided to \"wave a white flag.\" The IWW had won the Missoula free speech fight, and all charges were dropped.\n\nOn February 7, 2011, the National Park Service officially recognized Free Speech Corner at Higgens Avenue and West Front Street, adding it to the National Register of Historic Places to commemorate the Missoula free speech fight.\n\nThe free speech fight in San Diego from 1912 to 1913 was among the most prominent free speech fights of the IWW. An ordinance had been passed by the San Diego Common Council which made it much more difficult for the Wobblies to engage in their soapbox orations without being swiftly arrested. The San Diego jails were soon teeming with Wobblies and others who used civil disobedience in the fight for free speech, and, even more alarmingly, contingents of vigilantes arose to fight against those in favor of free speech. The Free Speech League worked in concert with the IWW in San Diego, but, when the fight became judicial, the ordinance was upheld.\n\nSioux City was considered a very strategic town for workers to stage free speech fights in because it was \"a gateway for laborers entering and leaving summer employment in agriculture and construction in the Dakotas.\" Since those employment opportunities for the workers were seasonal, many of them returned to spend the winter in Sioux City, where the Wobblies attempted to provide them incentives to join their Free Speech Fight such as by educating them and helping feed them over the tough winter. \n\nOver a thousand men were unemployed in Sioux City at the time during the winter of 1915. There had been a real push to get workers to come to Sioux City by business leaders there, but workers who arrived found that there were barely enough jobs for the local laborers. \nOn the 15th of January, after facing even harsher conditions and struggling with unemployment, roughly 150 of the IWW-associated unemployed stormed the Commercial Club where many business leaders listened to them demand work and watched them take food. \n\nIn response to the direct action of the IWW, Sioux City increased enforcement of vagrancy laws and began arresting more of the IWW members engaged in the Free Speech Fights. Their goal in doing so was to attempt to drive the IWW out of town, but, unsurprisingly, they achieved the opposite. The IWW demanded free speech rights to be granted in the city. They Wobblies were filling the city's jails and forced the hand of the city officials to attempt to strike a deal with them. Ultimately, they won the fight and free speech rights were granted to workers in Sioux City.\n\nThe IWW followed with other free speech fights in Kansas City, Missouri; in Aberdeen and Wenatchee, Washington; and in Fresno, California. Tar and feathers, beatings, clubbings, and forcible deportations were used in addition to incarceration. The San Diego free speech fight was unique in that the IWW did not have a specific organizing campaign at stake. The IWW won all of these free speech fights.\n\nIn early 1913, IWW members in Denver, Colorado fought a lengthy free speech fight. Denver authorities had refused to allow the Wobblies to speak on street corners, so union members filled the jails for months. The union won the right to speak to workers, and within a year had formed two Denver branches.\n\nOther locations of free speech fights by the IWW included Duluth, Minnesota; Portland, Oregon; New Castle, Pennsylvania, and New Bedford, Massachusetts.\n\nThe IWW message was particularly unpopular with the business community. IWW members believed that the capitalist system was corrupt, could not be reformed, and could only be resisted until a better society could be built for all working people. James Walsh's streetcorner speeches were therefore frequently disrupted, particularly by the local Volunteers of America and Salvation Army Bands.\n\nWalsh recruited volunteers to put together a small band, equipped with \"a big booming bass drum,\" in order to get the IWW's message to listeners. The group practiced patriotic and religious tunes of the period, but the Wobblies wrote new words to the songs.\n\n\"To grab the crowd's attention,\" the IWW band often \"hid in a doorway while one member dressed in a bowler hat and carrying a briefcase and umbrella, yelled to the crowd, 'Help! I've been robbed!' The crowd rushed over only to hear, 'I've been robbed by the capitalist system! Fellow workers ...' He then launched into a short speech, and the makeshift band stepped out of the doorway and played their songs.\"\nPrior to television, radio, and film becoming parts of American mass culture, public speaking was a primary medium for entertainment and information. Politicians, religious zealots, and newsboys all pitched their trade on the soapbox. Though not all street speakers were political, soapbox oration was fundamentally a political act. \n\nWith the march of time of the 20th century, police forces and city ordinances began to take away the rights of soapbox orators. As television and radio became more prominent, the very act of street speaking began to seem antiquated and, at the very least, irrelevant. Street speaking represented a threat to upper- and middle-class white Americans who feared that \"inter-ethnoracial, working-class political coalitions\" would achieve influence through the soap box. \n\nThis was especially true in Los Angeles, where class politics was reaching a fever pitch in the early 20th century. A multitude of political groups, such as the IWW, the Socialists, the Communist Party, and the Partido Liberal Mexicano all spoke out for Angelinos to fight for the rights of the underprivileged.\n\nIn the early 20th century, it was the Socialist Party that led the charge in soapbox oration. They were the first group to make effective use of the tactics of public speaking. Over the first ten years of the city, they grew enough to gain significant political clout. In Los Angeles, the party drew in skilled and semi-skilled white workers who worried about their job security. Additionally, they attempted to recruit central Angelinos from more diverse ethnic backgrounds. In this way, Free Speech Fights in Los Angeles served as the battleground between central Los Angeles workers and the rest of the city.\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, street speaking in Los Angeles suffered from increasing escalation of tactics by the LAPD and city ordinances. The Wobblies became the more dominant social group after the Socialists lost power, but the IWW was unable to draw nearly as many people to their soapbox speeches.\n\nThe IWW had a major conflict with the police over public speaking in San Pedro, a harbor community. They organized with striking dockworkers, but were met with extreme repression by the police who even used violent tactics to prevent their protests from being successful. Because of the failures in San Pedro, the IWW lost power in Southern California.\n\n\n\n"}

It is not related to the SOLID design principle.\n\nThe different patterns and principles used in GRASP are controller, creator, indirection, information expert, high cohesion, low coupling, polymorphism, protected variations, and pure fabrication. All these patterns answer some software problem, and these problems are common to almost every software development project. These techniques have not been invented to create new ways of working, but to better document and standardize old, tried-and-tested programming principles in object-oriented design. \n\nComputer scientist Craig Larman states that \"the critical design tool for software development is a mind well educated in design principles. It is not UML or any other technology.\" Thus, GRASP are really a mental toolset, a learning aid to help in the design of object-oriented software.\n\nIn OO design, a pattern is a named description of a problem and solution that can be applied to new contexts; ideally, a pattern advises us on how to apply its solution in varying circumstances and considers the forces and trade-offs. Many patterns, given a specific category of problem, guide the assignment of responsibilities to objects. \n\nThe controller pattern assigns the responsibility of dealing with system events to a non-UI class that represents the overall system or a use case scenario. A controller object is a non-user interface object responsible for receiving or handling a system event.\n\nA use case controller should be used to deal with \"all\" system events of a use case, and may be used for more than one use case (for instance, for use cases \"Create User\" and \"Delete User\", one can have a single class called \"UserController\", instead of two separate use case controllers(This may save some space)).\n\nThe controller is defined as the first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates (\"controls\") a system operation. The controller should delegate the work that needs to be done to other objects; it coordinates or controls the activity. It should not do much work itself. The GRASP Controller can be thought of as being a part of the application/service layer (assuming that the application has made an explicit distinction between the application/service layer and the domain layer) in an object-oriented system with common layers in an information system logical architecture.\n\nCreation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.\nIn general, a class codice_1 should be responsible for creating instances of class codice_2 if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:\n\nHigh cohesion is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, hard to reuse, hard to maintain and averse to change.\n\nInformation expert (also expert or the expert principle) is a principle used to determine where to delegate responsibilities. These responsibilities include methods, computed fields, and so on. \n\nUsing the principle of information expert, a general approach to assigning responsibilities is to look at a given responsibility, determine the information needed to fulfill it, and then determine where that information is stored. \n\nInformation expert will lead to placing the responsibility on the class with the most information required to fulfill it.\n\nCoupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. Low coupling is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities to support\n\nAccording to polymorphism principle, responsibility of defining the variation of behaviors based on type is assigned to the type for which this variation happens. This is achieved using polymorphic operations. The user of the type should use polymorphic operations instead of explicit branching based on type.\n\nThe protected variations pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements (objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an interface and using polymorphism to create various implementations of this interface.\n\nA pure fabrication is a class that does not represent a concept in the problem domain, specially made up to achieve low coupling, high cohesion, and the reuse potential thereof derived (when a solution presented by the \"information expert\" pattern does not). This kind of class is called a \"service\" in domain-driven design.\n\nThe indirection pattern supports low coupling and reuse potential between two elements by assigning the responsibility of mediation between them to an intermediate object. An example of this is the introduction of a controller component for mediation between data(model) and its representation(view) in the model-view control pattern.This ensures that coupling between them remains low.\n"}
{"id": "186322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186322", "title": "Gender feminism", "text": "Gender feminism\n\nGender feminism is a subdivision of feminism based on the view that the gender differences are social constructs perpetrated by men in order to maintain dominance over women.\n\nPrior to the usage of the term \"gender feminism\" Gayle Rubin's essay \"\" (1975) was published. In it she devised the phrase \"sex/gender system\", defining it as \"the set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity, and in which these transformed sexual needs are satisfied.\"\n\nIn the same year Sandra Lee Bartky, founding member of the Society for Women in Philosophy, wrote the essay, \"Toward a Phenomenology of Feminist Consciousness\", in which she said, \"[w]omen have long lamented their condition, but a lament, pure and simple, need not be an expression of feminist consciousness. As long as their situation is apprehended as natural, inevitable, and inescapable, women's consciousness of themselves, no matter how alive to insult and inferiority, is not yet feminist consciousness... The very meaning of what the feminist apprehends is illuminated by the light of what ought to be.\"\n\nIn 1983 the philosopher Alison Jaggar wrote of the need for a new name for the direction that socialist feminism was taking. \"Socialist feminism,\" she said, \"has indicated a new domain for political economy; it has identified the questions that feminist political theory must ask, and it has shown the sorts of answers that are acceptable. However, socialist feminism has not yet provided the answers, in part because of continuing uncertainty about how the redefined domain of political economy should be conceptualized.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s the philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers criticized the attempt to increase the amount of feminist philosophy being taught making reference to what she called \"academic feminism\".\n\nThe term \"gender feminism\" was first used by \"The New York Magazine\" in the early 1990s. In 1994 Sommers used the term to criticize Rubin, Bartky, Jaggar and other feminists in her book, \"Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women\".\n\nRetrospectively Jaggar stated that prior to the publication of \"Who Stole Feminism?\", \"Sommers was establishing her reputation as a defender of so-called traditional family values against those whom she called radical \"gender feminists,\" a term she invented [in her book] to refer to any feminist who had moved beyond the ideas of nineteenth-century philosopher, John Stuart Mill.\"\n\nSubsequent use of the term in the early 1990s by other theorists referencing Sommers work expanded its usage as a pejorative term.\n\nGender feminism has been described as asserting that psychological differences between the sexes have little or nothing to do with evolution, but instead are largely or solely socially constructed. Various theorists have applied both negative and positive connotations to gender feminism.\n\nPhilosopher Martha Nussbaum puts forward a set of questions are raised when considering the future of feminism in America:\n\nComparing the advantages that American women have to women in developing countries, Nussbaum states that Sommers seems to think that women have no urgent complaints to press and she is critical of Sommers for not saying what she thinks about \"legal developments aimed at securing full political and social equality for women ... [e.g.] laws against sexual harassment and marital rape.\" By not stating her views, Nussbaum says, \"it is difficult to tell how close [Sommers] really is to the 'grass-roots constituency' that she claims to be representing.\"\n\nHowever, Nussbaum states that it provides a way of reframing her original set of questions about the future of feminism in America:\nThe first two questions Nussbaum answers with a \"yes\" and the third with a \"no.\"\n\nFeminists have largely dismissed Sommers' claims. They have asserted that Sommers' concept of gender feminism is merely a straw man. They have asserted that many of feminisms and feminist authors grouped together by Sommers are incompatible in their basic philosophical presuppositions. Victoria Davion has asserted that no one believes in gender feminism as Sommers defines it, based on its conceptual incoherence. Specifically, both Alison Jaggar and Marilyn Friedman have both asserted that Sommers severely misrepresented their views.\n\nSommers endorses equity feminism which she equates with first-wave feminism, rooted in the philosophy of liberalism. She distinguishes this perspective from second-wave feminism or gender feminism, which she describes as regarding all women as oppressed by an all-encompassing system of patriarchy. She further describes gender feminists as supporting difference feminism, quoting authors who asserts that standards for good art are gendered. For Sommers, gender or \"political feminism\" is defined in opposition to individualist feminism.\n\nWendy McElroy also defines gender or political feminism in opposition to individualist feminism, and synonymous with radical feminism.\nMcElroy describes gender feminism as rooted in social constructionism. She describes gender feminists as asserting that women lack agency and are solely defined by the social institutions they inhabit, unable to make free choices. Accordingly, McElroy describes the gender feminist agenda as the destruction or transformation of social institutions. McElroy rejects these views as a means of disregarding the free choices of women to support existing institutions and oppose gender feminism.\n\nSteven Pinker, in his book, \"The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature\", elaborating on the dichotomy of Hoff Sommers, states that gender feminism is allied with Marxism, postmodernism, and social constructionism, and as such is based on three claims: gender differences are purely socially constructed and have no biological basis, human behavior is shaped by the single motive of desire for power, and human interactions are best understood not from individual psychology but from the motives of groups responding to groups. Pinker endorses Hoff Sommers' contrast of gender feminism vs. equity feminism, with the latter seen as making a moral claim in favor of legal and social equality without making particular assertions about human behavior or biology. He regards difference feminism as an offshoot of gender feminism.\n\nIt has been used to distinguish perceived radical feminism and liberal feminism. It has also been used in relation to some feminists' arguments that all cognition is gendered and that all knowledge is gendered.\n"}

Each period has seen a progressive decline in morality, to the point that in Kali Yuga quarrel and hypocrisy are norm. In Hinduism, time is cyclic, consisting of cycles or \"kalpas\". Each kalpa lasts 8.64 billion years, which is a period of one full day and night for Brahma, who in turn will live for 311 trillion, 40 billion years. The cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal at the individual level finds its echo in the cosmic order, yet is affected by the vagaries of divine intervention in Vaishnavism. Some Shaivites hold the view that he is incessantly destroying and creating the world.\n\nAfter this larger cycle, all of creation will contract to a singularity and then again will expand from that single point, as the ages continue in a religious fractal pattern.\n\nWithin the current \"kalpa\", there are four \"yugas\", or epochs, that encompass the evolution of this specific cycle. These ages encompass a beginning of complete purity to a descent into total decay.\n\n\nKali Yuga, the last of the four ages, is the one in which we currently reside. This epoch has been foretold to be characterized by impiety, violence, and decay. As written in the Vishnu Purana in 100 BCE:\n\nThe fourth age is ruled over by Kali, not the goddess Kali but the demon Kali. Puranas go on to write that kings in the fourth age will be godless, wanting in tranquility, quick to anger, and dishonest. They will inflict death on women, and children, and will rise and fall to power quickly. Undisciplined barbarians will receive the support of rulers.\n\nFrom the four pillars of dharma—penance, charity, truthfulness, and compassion—charity will be all that remains, although it too will decrease daily. People will commit sin in mind, speech and action. Plague, famine, pestilence and natural calamities will appear. People will not believe one another, falsehoods will win disputes and brothers will become avaricious. As the each age progresses, the human life span decreases, starting from thousands of years in the Krutha Yuga to 100 years in the current Kali Yuga.\n\nSannyasins will wear red. There will be many false religions, and many will profess false knowledge to earn their livelihood. Life will be short and miserable. Marriage will be for pleasure alone. Being dry of water will be the only definition of land, and any hard to reach water will define a pilgrimage destination. People will hide in valleys between mountains, and suffering from cold and exposure, people will wear clothes of tree bark and leaves. People will live less than twenty-three years and the pretense of greatness will be the proof of it. Ultimately, humankind will be destroyed.\n\nAt this time of evil, the final incarnation of Vishnu known as Kalki will appear on a white horse. He will amass an army of those few pious souls remaining. These, together with all the incarnations of the Godhead (avatars) which have appeared throughout human history, will destroy all demons and sins in the world.\n\nAs written in the Gita:<br>\n<poem>:Yadaa Yadaa hi Dharmasya Glaanir bhavati Bhaarata\n\nAditi is the mother of the eight Adityas or solar deities. At the end of creation these eight suns will shine together in the skies. Kalki will amass an army to \"establish righteousness upon the earth\" and leave \"the minds of the people as pure as crystal.\" Those left, transformed by virtue, will be the new seeds for a higher form of humanity, and humanity will begin again.\n\nPuranas write: \n\nAt the completion of Kali Yuga, the next epoch will begin, Satya Yuga, in which everyone will be righteous with the reestablishment of dharma and piety. This, in turn, will be followed cyclically by epochs of Treta Yuga, Dwapara Yuga and again another Kali Yuga. This cycle will repeat till the larger cycle of existence under Brahma returns to the singularity and a new universe is born.\n\nWithin Hinduism, there are more distinguishing scenarios in certain sects. Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi of the Brahma Kumari has written that their prediction of the imminent end of the world is hidden from non-members. Within their tradition, the majority of the planet is predicted to become submerged beneath the ocean, similar to the Ragnarök of Nordic mythology.\n\nSri Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami, wrote 400 years ago in his \"Divya Maha Kala Gnana,\" or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event.\n\n"}

In this process, starting from some initial number, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated.\n\nIterated functions are objects of study in computer science, fractals, dynamical systems, mathematics and renormalization group physics.\n\nThe formal definition of an iterated function on a set \"X\" follows.\n\nLet be a set and be a function.\n\nDefine as the \"n\"-th iterate of , where \"n\" is a non-negative integer, by:\n\nand\n\nwhere is the identity function on and denotes function composition. That is, \nalways associative.\n\nBecause the notation may refer to both iteration (composition) of the function or exponentiation of the function (the latter is commonly used in trigonometry), some mathematicians choose to write for the \"n\"-th iterate of the function .\n\nIn general, the following identity holds for all non-negative integers and ,\n\nThis is structurally identical to the property of exponentiation that , i.e. the special case .\n\nIn general, for arbitrary general (negative, non-integer, etc.) indices and , this relation is called the translation functional equation, cf. Schröder's equation and Abel equation. On a logarithmic scale, this reduces to the nesting property of Chebyshev polynomials, , since .\n\nThe relation also holds, analogous to the property of exponentiation that .\n\nThe sequence of functions is called a Picard sequence, named after Charles Émile Picard.\n\nFor a given in , the sequence of values is called the orbit of .\n\nIf for some integer , the orbit is called a periodic orbit. The smallest such value of for a given is called the period of the orbit. The point itself is called a periodic point. The cycle detection problem in computer science is the algorithmic problem of finding the first periodic point in an orbit, and the period of the orbit.\n\nIf \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" for some \"x\" in \"X\" (that is, the period of the orbit of \"x\" is 1), then \"x\" is called a fixed point of the iterated sequence. The set of fixed points is often denoted as Fix(\"f\" ). There exist a number of fixed-point theorems that guarantee the existence of fixed points in various situations, including the Banach fixed point theorem and the Brouwer fixed point theorem.\n\nThere are several techniques for convergence acceleration of the sequences produced by fixed point iteration. For example, the Aitken method applied to an iterated fixed point is known as Steffensen's method, and produces quadratic convergence.\n\nUpon iteration, one may find that there are sets that shrink and converge towards a single point. In such a case, the point that is converged to is known as an attractive fixed point. Conversely, iteration may give the appearance of points diverging away from a single point; this would be the case for an unstable fixed point. \nWhen the points of the orbit converge to one or more limits, the set of accumulation points of the orbit is known as the limit set or the ω-limit set.\n\nThe ideas of attraction and repulsion generalize similarly; one may categorize iterates into stable sets and unstable sets, according to the behaviour of small neighborhoods under iteration. (Also see Infinite compositions of analytic functions.)\n\nOther limiting behaviours are possible; for example, wandering points are points that move away, and never come back even close to where they started.\n\nIf one considers the evolution of a density distribution, rather than that of individual point dynamics, then the limiting behavior is given by the invariant measure. It can be visualized as the behavior of a point-cloud or dust-cloud under repeated iteration. The invariant measure is a eigenstate of the Ruelle-Frobenius-Perron operator or transfer operator, corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1. Smaller eigenvalues correspond to unstable, decaying states.\n\nIn general, because repeated iteration corresponds to a shift, the transfer operator, and its adjoint, the Koopman operator can both be interpreted as shift operators action on a shift space. The theory of subshifts of finite type provides general insight into many iterated functions, especially those leading to chaos.\n\nIn some instances, fractional iteration of a function can be defined: for instance, a half iterate of a function is a function such that . This function can be written using the index notation as . Similarly, is the function defined such that , while may be defined equal to , and so forth, all based on the principle, mentioned earlier, that . This idea can be generalized so that the iteration count becomes a continuous parameter, a sort of continuous \"time\" of a continuous orbit.\n\nIn such cases, one refers to the system as a flow, specified by Schröder's equation. (cf. Section on conjugacy below.)\n\nNegative iterates correspond to function inverses and their compositions. For example, is the normal inverse of , while is the inverse composed with itself, i.e. . Fractional negative iterates are defined analogously to fractional positive ones; for example, is defined such that , or, equivalently, such that .\n\nOne of several methods of finding a series formula for fractional iteration, making use of a fixed point, is as follows.\n\nThis can be carried on indefinitely, although inefficiently, as the latter terms become increasingly complicated.\nA more systematic procedure is outlined in the following section on Conjugacy.\n\nFor example, setting gives the fixed point , so the above formula terminates to just\nwhich is trivial to check.\n\nFind the value of formula_10 where this is done \"n\" times (and possibly the interpolated values when \"n\" is not an integer). We have . A fixed point is .\n\nSo set \"x\"=1 and expanded around the fixed point value of 2 is then an infinite series,\nwhich, taking just the first three terms, is correct to the first decimal place when \"n\" is positive—cf. Tetration: . (Using the other fixed point causes the series to diverge.)\n\nFor , the series computes the inverse function, .\n\nWith the function , expand around the fixed point 1 to get the series\nwhich is simply the Taylor series of \"x\" expanded around 1.\n\nIf and are two iterated functions, and there exists a homeomorphism such that , then and are said to be topologically conjugate.\n\nClearly, topological conjugacy is preserved under iteration, as . Thus, if one can solve for one iterated function system, one also has solutions for all topologically conjugate systems. For example, the tent map is topologically conjugate to the logistic map. As a special case, taking , one has the iteration of as \n\nMaking the substitution yields \n\nEven in the absence of a strict homeomorphism, near a fixed point, here taken to be at = 0, (0) = 0, one may often solve Schröder's equation for a function , which makes locally conjugate to a mere dilation, , that is \n\nThus, its iteration orbit, or flow, under suitable provisions (e.g., ), amounts to the conjugate of the orbit of the monomial, \nwhere in this expression serves as a plain exponent: \"functional iteration has been reduced to multiplication!\" Here, however, the exponent no longer needs be integer or positive, and is a continuous \"time\" of evolution for the full orbit: the monoid of the Picard sequence (cf. transformation semigroup) has generalized to a full continuous group.\n\nThis method (perturbative determination of the principal eigenfunction , cf. Carleman matrix) is equivalent to the algorithm of the preceding section, albeit, in practice, more powerful and systematic.\n\nIf the function is linear and can be described by a stochastic matrix, that is, a matrix whose rows or columns sum to one, then the iterated system is known as a Markov chain.\n\nThere are many chaotic maps. \nWell-known iterated functions include the Mandelbrot set and iterated function systems.\n\nErnst Schröder, in 1870, worked out special cases of the logistic map, such as the chaotic case , so that , hence .\n\nA nonchaotic case Schröder also illustrated with his method, , yielded , and hence .\n\nIf is the action of a group element on a set, then the iterated function corresponds to a free group.\n\nMost functions do not have explicit general closed-form expressions for the \"n\"-th iterate. The table below lists some that do. Note that all these expressions are valid even for non-integer and negative \"n\", as well as positive integer \"n\".\nNote: these two special cases of are the only cases that have a closed-form solution. Choosing \"b\" = 2 = –\"a\" and \"b\" = 4 = –\"a\", respectively, further reduces them to the nonchaotic and chaotic logistic cases discussed prior to the table.\n\nSome of these examples are related among themselves by simple conjugacies. A few further examples, essentially amounting to simple conjugacies of Schröder's examples can be found in ref.\n\nIterated functions can be studied with the Artin–Mazur zeta function and with transfer operators.\n\nIn computer science, iterated functions occur as a special case of recursive functions, which in turn anchor the study of such broad topics as lambda calculus, or narrower ones, such as the denotational semantics of computer programs.\n\nTwo important functionals can be defined in terms of iterated functions. These are summation:\n\nand the equivalent product:\n\nThe functional derivative of an iterated function is given by the recursive formula:\n\nIterated functions crop up in the series expansion of combined functions, such as .\n\nGiven the iteration velocity, or beta function (physics), \nfor the iterate of the function , we have\nFor example, for rigid advection, if , then . Consequently, , action by a plain shift operator.\n\nConversely, one may specify given an arbitrary , through the generic Abel equation discussed above,\nwhere\nThis is evident by noting that \n\nFor continuous iteration index , then, now written as a subscript, this amounts to Lie's celebrated exponential realization of a continuous group,\nThe initial flow velocity suffices to determine the entire flow, given this exponential realization which automatically provides the general solution to the \"translation functional equation\", \n\n"}

The spacecraft or payload may or may not be attached to the launch vehicle during the WDR or static fire, but sufficient elements of the rocket and all relevant ground support equipment are in place to help verify that the rocket is ready for flight, with the goal of allowing problems to be seen prior to the actual launch.\n\nA wet dress rehearsal is called \"wet\" because the liquid propellant components (such as liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, etc.) are loaded into the rocket during the test. In a pure wet dress rehearsal the rocket engines are not ignited.\n\nA static fire test includes a wet dress rehearsal and goes one step farther: actually firing the engines at full thrust. The engine (or engines) is fired for a few seconds while the launch vehicle, with or without payload attached, is held firmly attached to the launch mount. This tests engine startup while measuring pressure, temperature and propellant-flow gradients. The data gathered in such tests may be used to form a unique (rocket- and engine-specific) set of criteria as part of the go/nogo decision tree in the automated launch software that is used on the actual launch day, typically a few days later. Some static fire tests have fired the engines for up to twelve seconds, although shorter firings are more typical.\n\nMany launch service providers do not regularly perform wet dress rehearsals on new launch vehicles; some regularly perform wet dress rehearsals or even full static fire system tests on the launch mount. For example, SpaceX typically performs a full static fire on every new booster and also on each reflown booster before every launch, sometimes more than once. In January 2018, SpaceX did two wet dress rehearsals on the Zuma Falcon 9 mission, and aimed for, and conducted, multiple wet dress rehearsals on the new Falcon Heavy launch vehicle design which had its maiden launch on February 6, 2018. Both were explicitly booked as wet dress rehearsals, but with the option to proceed to a static fire test. In the event, the second wet dress rehearsal on 24 January 2018 did lead to a full 12-second static fire test of the 27 engines of the Falcon Heavy—a much longer static fire test than the usual 3–7 second duration tests SpaceX uses for the Falcon 9.\n\nWet rehearsal and static fire tests can fail catastrophically, as with a pad explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 on 1 September 2016, which resulted from a major breach of the cryogenic helium system of the second stage of the rocket during the propellant-loading operations, well before the planned ignition of the engines for a static fire test sequence. The explosion destroyed the rocket and its payload - the Amos-6 satellite. Furthermore, due to extensive fire, the SLC-40 launch pad was heavily damaged and had to be rebuilt.\n\n"}

Mass moments of inertia have units of dimension ML([mass] × [length]). It should not be confused with the second moment of area, which is used in beam calculations. The mass moment of inertia is often also known as the rotational inertia, and sometimes as the angular mass.\n\nFor simple objects with geometric symmetry, one can often determine the moment of inertia in an exact closed-form expression. Typically this occurs when the mass density is constant, but in some cases the density can vary throughout the object as well. In general, it may not be straightforward to symbolically express the moment of inertia of shapes with more complicated mass distributions and lacking symmetry. When calculating moments of inertia, it is useful to remember that it is an additive function and exploit the parallel axis and perpendicular axis theorems.\n\nThis article mainly considers symmetric mass distributions, with constant density throughout the object, and the axis of rotation is taken to be through the center of mass unless otherwise specified.\n\nFollowing are scalar moments of inertia.

{"id": "35226515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35226515", "title": "MAgPIE", "text": "MAgPIE\n\nMAgPIE is a non-linear, recursive, dynamic-optimization, global land and water-use model with a cost-minimization objective function.\nMAgPIE was developed and is employed by the land-use group working at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). It links regional economic information with grid-based biophysical constraints simulated by the dynamic vegetation and hydrology model LPJmL. MAgPIE considers spatially-explicit patterns of production, land use change and water constraints in different world regions, consistently linking economic development with food and energy demand.\n\nThe model is based on static yield functions in order to model potential crop productivity and its related water use. For the biophysical supply simulation, spatially explicit 0.5° data is aggregated to a consistent number of clusters. Ten world regions represent the demand side of the model. Required calories for the demand categories (food and non-food energy intake) are determined by a cross-sectional country regression based on population and income projections. In order to fulfill the demand, the model allocates 19 cropping and 5 livestock activities to the spatially-explicit land and water resources, subject to resource, management and cost constraints. From 1995 MAgPIE simulates time-steps of 10 years. For each period the optimal land use pattern from the previous period is used as a starting point. \n\nThe demand for agricultural products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food demand, material demand, feed demand and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region.\n\nFeed for livestock is produced as a mixture of concentrates, fodder, livestock products (e.g. bone meal), pasture, crop residues and conversion by-products (e.g. rapeseed cake) at predefined proportions. These differences in the livestock systems cause different emission levels from livestock.\n\nThe biophysical inputs for the simulations are obtained from the grid-based model LPJmL. The global vegetation model with managed land (LPJmL) also delivers values for water availability and requirements for each grid cell as well as the carbon content of the different vegetation types. Cropland, pasture, and irrigation water are fixed inputs in limited supply in each grid cell.\n\nMAgPIE takes four different cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components on a global scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). \n\nMAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC). Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural land-use intensity raises costs for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.\n\nTo increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land. The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit as a function of the distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.\n"}

Cernovich rejects the label alt-right, describing himself as \"new right\". The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified him as a male supremacist.\n\nRaised into a poor family in Kewanee, Illinois, Cernovich studied through the University of Illinois system and then the Pepperdine University School of Law. He began blogging in the 2000s, focusing on anti-feminist themes and becoming known within the manosphere. His website, \"Danger and Play\", known originally for its men's rights advocacy, was created in 2012. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, it evolved into a largely pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton political blog.\n\nCernovich often promotes fake news, conspiracy theories, and smear campaigns, including Pizzagate, the false theory that John Podesta and other high-ranking Democratic Party officials were involved in a child-sex ring. Cernovich currently serves as a regular host of \"The Alex Jones Show\" on InfoWars, a show that promotes fake news and conspiracy theories. Cernovich has on multiple occasions falsely accused various journalists and anti-Trump figures of being pedophiles or being supportive of pedophilia.\n\nCernovich was born on November 17, 1977. He grew up in a devout Christian family in the farming town of Kewanee, Illinois. The family was poor, and his mother suffered from mental illness and spent time in an institution. He graduated from the University of Illinois system and later from the Pepperdine University School of Law.\n\nIn 2004, Cernovich started a legal weblog entitled Crime & Federalism, and his blog was selected for syndication by American Lawyer Media.\n\nIn his early writings Cernovich focused on antifeminism, men's empowerment, and how to meet women. The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, \"The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\" In 2014, Cernovich promoted Gamergate, a controversy during which several women in the video game industry were targeted by Internet trolls, goading opponents with tweets such as \"Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me.\"\n\nIn 2015, Cernovich wrote a self-published self-help book, \"Gorilla Mindset\". In 2016, he tweeted, \"Women love aggressive men, but only if they are alpha males.\" According to \"The New York Times\" in April 2017, Cernovich has long been criticized for arguing that date rape is a \"harmful concept for men and women.\" He saw Donald Trump as a kindred spirit and began to engage in political commentary.\n\nCernovich had previously – in early 2006 – published an article deriding Trump on Crime & Federalism. The piece referred to the billionaire as a \"media whore\" who \"casts his image to the world on demand and recasts it constantly to suit everchanging ratings and marketing schemes,\" and advised to \"never trust a man who combs his hair so as to cover his shiny dome, and then flaunts a wife young enough to be his daughter.\"\n\nCernovich became influential on social media, initially as part of the manosphere movement, and more recently has helped to shape far-right narratives in the United States. He falsely claimed during the 2016 United States presidential election that Hillary Clinton had a \"seizure disorder\" and Parkinson's disease. By September his #HillarysHealth hashtag had gotten 240,000 page views and had become a national trending topic on Twitter. During the month of September, Cernovich's tweets were seen more than 100 million times.\n\nCernovich frequently calls his adversaries \"cucks\", a variant of the alt-right slang word cuckservative, a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this he has written, \"To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. Logic is pointless.\" Cernovich admits to sometimes using trolling tactics, which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement.\n\nCernovich helped popularize the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory through his blog posts and believes that child sex rings run rampant in Washington, D.C. He has accused his opponents of being pedophiles on multiple occasions, and in a YouTube video maintained that most people employed by the news media and \"every A-list actor\" in Hollywood were also pedophiles.\n\nIn October 2016 Cernovich said:\n\n\"The left likes to talk about power structures, right? Well, the media still thinks of itself as speaking truth to power. What they don't realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new Fourth Estate. Maybe they should check their structural privilege.\" The \"paternalistic\" media, he said, was giving way to a more democratic one. \"It makes journalists crazy, because they used to be in control. They can't control people anymore. Everyone has a voice now.\"\n\nFollowing an August 2016 appearance on Fox News's \"Red Eye\", the show's producers felt compelled afterwards to say that they had made a mistake in booking him when later learning of Cernovich's history of online disputes.\n\nCernovich has accused the Democratic Party of attempting to assassinate him. In 2016, Cernovich criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for speaking at a gender-segregated mosque. \n\nIn August 2017, the Anti-Defamation League accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a \"blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon\" by Ben Garrison as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.\n\nIn November 2017, Cernovich spread misinformation linking the Sutherland Springs church shooting to Antifa.\n\nIn August 2012 Cernovich wrote that date rape \"does not exist\". In October 2016 he wrote, \"Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped.\"\nIn mid-November 2017, Cernovich offered $10,000 for information about congressional sexual harassment settlements. The next week, he sent documents concerning a case settled by John Conyers to BuzzFeed, which vetted them and reported on them. Cernovich encouraged all victims of sexual assault by congressmen to speak up and offered to cover their legal expenses.\n\nIn December 2017, Cernovich hosted an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit. The \"AMA\", regarded as a failure by several media outlets, was dominated by users mocking him and asking questions about the rape allegations against him, his advice to men to nonconsensually expose their genitalia and masturbate in front of women who are unwilling to engage in sexual acts, and a supposed sexual encounter with a male-to-female transgender individual in Thailand (which Cernovich denied). A few days later, he announced his intention to retire from social media, but reversed the decision within hours.\n\nIn July 2018, he publicized historical tweets in which director James Gunn, a critic of Trump, had joked about rape and pedophilia; Gunn was fired by Disney as a result. Cernovich has made a number of tweets about rape, including comments that \"date rape does not exist\" and that \"A whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case. So why should I care when women are raped?\"\n\nAccording to Politico website, during the 2016 campaign and early period of the Trump administration, Cernovich was an \"indefatigable Trump cheerleader\", hoping that he and kindred activists would have a major influence on the Republican Party. However, by 2018, he had become \"increasingly critical\" of Trump, and turning away from politics toward his “Gorilla Mindset” lifestyle-coaching practice. In September 2018, he tweeted, “There’s no Wall. She’s not locked up. But Flynn got fired and sent to wolves. And Sauadi [sic] Arabia sold weapons of murder. I give zero f-cks about Republicans losing the House.” Cernovich complimented democratic socialist (and Trump critic) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her primary election upset of New York Congressman Joe Crowley: “She just slaughtered fucking Crowley, just slaughtered the machine, and now she’s like the ‘it’ girl, ... I like to watch peak human achievement.”\n\nFollowing the 2018 missile strikes against Syria – which were criticized by Cernovich and split Trump's political base – he announced that he would pivot to \"philosophy\" and more esoteric content. Cernovich claimed that he had felt a \"cosmic\" \"shift in energy\" which only \"high-consciousness people\" were able to experience. He also elaborated on his past use of mind-altering drugs and referred to reality as a \"simulation\" several times.\n\nOn November 28, 2017, Cernovich published a post on Medium which resurfaced a deleted 2009 tweet made by progressive talk radio host and MSNBC political commentator Sam Seder, in which he joked about convicted child rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, \"Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scène.\" Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's pedophilia. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story.\n\nDespite explaining the tweet to MSNBC Senior VP of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. via email, on December 4, 2017, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had elected to sever ties with Seder by not renewing his contract (due to expire in February 2018) due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland. That he was, in fact, mocking Polanski's apologists. After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph.\n\nBy then, Seder noted that advertisers on \"The Majority Report with Sam Seder\" podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to ensure the show is funded if the advertisers decided to bail. In an episode of the podcast titled, \"I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right\", Seder said, \"this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009\" and that he will \"never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls.\" Seder also revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. He surmised this was retribution for his frequent criticism of US President Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, \"I think they're afraid of those people.\"\nThe news of Seder's dismissal received immediate backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. Multiple news publications pilloried MSNBC. MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, \"The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness.\" Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: \"Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith.\" Actress Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder.\n\nThere was considerable dissent within MSNBC over the termination. Employees worried firing Seder incentivized other far-right personalities to launch similar campaigns. MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, \"Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons—because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.\" In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back:\n\nColumbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired. Cernovich, for his part, acknowledged that \"some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic.\" However, he still insisted he didn't misrepresent the tweet. He later admitted that the whole incident was a stunt while claiming victory explaining, retroactively, it was meant to bring attention to what he perceived was a double standard and a lack of \"diversity of viewpoint\" in the media, He also tweeted that he was \"thrilled\" MSNBC offered Seder his job back while threatening to \"bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet.\" On December 9, 2017, having failed to get Seder fired, Cernovich claimed that his wife was being stalked at the behest of the media.\n\nAlthough describing himself as politically center-right, he supports single-payer healthcare and \"some form of universal basic income\". Cernovich advocates IQ-testing for all immigrants and ending federal funding of universities. He opposes the two-party system and his support for Trump is not based on public policy. \"What are Trump's policies? I don't particularly care\". In another post on his website he stated, \"If Trump offends you, it's because you live in a cucked world where no one speaks their minds\".\n\nVarious press sources have labelled Cernovich as being part of the alt-right movement; a label that Cernovich has rejected. In his study of the alt-right, the political scientist George Hawley also disputed this characterization, stating that Cernovich \"might be properly labelled\" as \"alt-lite\". Similarly, the commentator Angela Nagle described Cernovich as a \"major figure in the alt-light milieu\".\n\nIn April 2017, Cernovich promoted the conspiracy theory that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in Syria was a hoax funded by an American financier.\n\nIn a February 2012 blog post, Cernovich argued that men should not \"settle for the make out. If possible, at least pull out your dick. If you can get her to touch it, even better\" and promoted masturbation in front of women reluctant to engage in sex.\n\nCernovich has been supportive of a universal basic income within the United States, claiming that \"Conservatism is on the way out\" regarding national social programmes. Interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" in March 2017, where he also advocated for single-payer healthcare, he said if \"a large swath of the company, or country, are suffering, then I think that we owe it to all Americans to do right by them and to help them out.\"\n\nCernovich believes in the white genocide conspiracy theory, saying that \"white genocide is real\" in relation to South Africa. He has stated that he initially joined the alt-right after realizing that \"tolerance only went one way and diversity is code for white genocide\". He later deleted several tweets referring to the concept.\n\nCernovich married his first wife as a law student in 2003. Cernovich has said the marriage was \"ruined by feminist indoctrination\". His wife became an attorney in Silicon Valley and earned millions of dollars from an initial public offering of stock. She filed for divorce in 2011, and Cernovich received what he has described as a \"seven-figure sum\" in the settlement. Cernovich met his second wife shortly thereafter, and lives outside of Los Angeles, California.\n\nDuring an interview with his wife, when referring to his feelings about becoming a father to a baby girl, Cernovich said, \"I’ll be nice to her, as long as she’s not a basic bitch.\"\n\nCernovich was charged with and arrested for rape in 2003, but he denied the allegations. The charge related to this incident was later reduced to misdemeanor battery of a woman, for which he performed community service.\n"}

For example, while studying social cognition, Solomon Asch and Gustav Ichheiser wrote in 1949:\n\nThe formal proposal of naïve cynicism came from Kruger and Gilovich's 1999 study called \"'Naive cynicism' in everyday theories of responsibility assessment: On biased assumptions of bias\".\n\nThe theory of naïve cynicism can be described as:\n\nAs with naïve realism, the theory of naïve cynicism hinges on the acceptance of the following three beliefs:\n\nNaïve cynicism can be thought of as the counter to naïve realism, which is the belief that an individual perceives the social world objectively while others perceive it subjectively.\nIt is important to discern that naïve cynicism is related to the notion that others have an egocentric bias that motivates them to do things for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic reasons.\n\nBoth of these theories, however, relate to the extent that adults credit or discredit the beliefs or statements of others.\n\nPsychological egoism is the belief that humans are always motivated by self-interest.\n\nIn a related quote, Joel Feinberg, in his 1958 paper \"Psychological Egoism\", embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the infinite regress of psychological egoism:\n<poem>\"All men desire only satisfaction.\"\n\"Satisfaction of what?\"\n\"Satisfaction of their desires.\"\n\"Their desires for what?\"\n\"Their desires for satisfaction.\"\n\"Satisfaction of what?\"\n\"Their desires.\"\n\"For what?\"\n\"For satisfaction\"—etc., \"ad infinitum\".</poem>\n\nThe circular reasoning evidenced by Feinberg's quote exemplifies how this view can be thought of as the need for others to have incessant personal desires and satisfaction.\n\nThere are several ways to define naïve cynicism such as:\n\nThe American reaction to a Russian SALT treaty during the Cold War is one well-known example of naïve cynicism in history. Political leaders negotiating on behalf of the United States discredited the offer simply because it was proposed by the Russian side.\n\nFormer U.S. congressman Floyd Spence indicates the use of naïve cynicism in this quote:\n\nConsumers exhibit naïve cynicism toward commercial companies and advertisers through suspicion and awareness toward marketing strategies used by such companies.\n\nThe public displays naïve cynicism toward governments and political leaders through distrust.\n\nEmployees of large business organizations frequently exhibit naïve cynicism toward their companies and executives in the workplace through employee cynicism or organizational cynicism.\n\nNaïve cynicism can be exemplified in some decision-making behaviors such as:\n\n\nNaïve cynicism can contribute to several negative outcomes including:\n\n\nThe major strategy to attenuate naïve cynicism in individuals has been shown by:\n\n\nAs a result of applying this strategy, happier married couples were less likely to exhibit cynical beliefs about each other’s judgments.\n\nIndividuals are especially likely to exhibit naïve cynicism when the other person has a vested interest in the judgment at hand. However, if the other person is dispassionate about the judgment at hand, the individual will be less likely to engage in naïve cynicism and think the other person will see things the way they do.\n\nNaïve cynicism may play a major role in these psychology-related contexts:\n\nIn one series of classic experiments by Kruger and Gilovich, groups including video game players, darts players and debaters were asked how often they were responsible for good or bad events relative to their partner. Participants evenly apportioned themselves for both good and bad events, but expected their partner to claim more responsibility for good events than bad events (egocentric bias) than they actually did.\n\nIn the same study conducted by Kruger and Gilovich, married couples were also examined and ultimately exhibited the same type of naïve cynicism about their marriage partner as did partners of dart players, video game players and debaters.\n\nNaïve cynicism has been exemplified in the context of altruism. Explanations of selfless human behavior have been described in terms of individuals seeking personal advantage as opposed to absolute altruism.\n\nFor example, naïve cynicism would explain the act of an individual donating money or items to charity as a way of self-enhancement rather than for altruistic purposes.\n\nDispositionists are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by some internal factor, such as beliefs, values, personality traits or abilities, rather than the situation they find themselves in.\n\nSituationists, in contrast, are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by external factors outside of one's control.\n\nDispositionists exemplify naïve cynicism while situationists do not. Therefore, situationist attributions are often thought to be more accurate than dispositionist attributions. However, dispositionist attributions are commonly believed to be the dominant schema because situationist attributions tend to be dismissed or attacked.\n\nIn a direct quote from Benforado and Hanson's paper titled \"Naïve Cynicism: Maintaining False Perceptions in Policy Debates\", the situationist and dispositionist are described as:\n\n\nIn addition to purely psychological contexts, naïve cynicism may play a major role in several applied contexts such as:\n\nNaïve cynicism has been studied extensively in several contexts of negotiating such as bargaining tactics, specifically in the sense that too much naïve cynicism can be costly.\n\nNegotiators displaying naïve cynicism rely on distributive and competitive strategies and focus on gaining concessions rather than on problem-solving. This can be detrimental and lead to reduced information exchange, information concealment, coordination, cooperation and quality of information revealed.\n\nThe following strategies have been identified as ways to reduce naïve cynicism in the context of negotiations:\n\nIt has been shown that individuals who focus more on the perspectives of their opponents were more successful in experimental laboratory negotiations.\n\nTaking another person's perspective produced better predictions of opponents' goals and biases, though it is noted that many individuals lack the ability to properly change perspectives. These incapable individuals tend to view their opponents as passive and can be prone to ignore valuable information disseminated during negotiations.\n\nNegotiator role reversal is believed to be an important focus of training for individuals to be less inclined to use naïve cynicism during negotiations. This process involves having each negotiator verbally consider their opponents perspective prior to making any judgements.\n\nIt has been shown when communication between opponents in negotiations is strong, negotiators are more likely to avoid stalemates.\n\nNegotiators who exhibit strong communication skills tend to believe integrity should be reciprocally displayed by both sides and thus regard open communication as a positive aspect in negotiations. Those negotiators high in communication skills also tend to view deadlocks as a negative event and will avoid reaching an impasse in order to reach an agreement.\n\nDespite attempts to reduce errors of naïve cynicism in laboratory studies with error-related feedback, errors still persisted even after many trials and strong feedback.\n\nIn relation to governmental policy debates, it is hypothesized that naïve cynicism fosters a distrust of other political parties and entities. Naïve cynicism is thought to be a critical contributor for why certain legal policies succeed and others fail.\n\nFor example, naïve cynicism is thought to be a factor contributing to the existence of detention centers such as Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, Bagram Air Base and more.\n\nBiases including the following have been argued to be caused at least partially by naïve cynicism:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13810222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13810222", "title": "Northeastern Iberian script", "text": "Northeastern Iberian script\n\nThe northeastern Iberian script, also known as Levantine Iberian or Iberian because the Iberian script was the most frequently used, was the main means of written expression of the Iberian language. The language is also expressed by the southeastern Iberian script and the Greco-Iberian alphabet. To understand the relationship between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, one should point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs. However, it is clear they have a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script was derived from the southeastern Iberian script. Some researchers have concluded that it is linked to the Phoenician alphabet alone, but others believe the Greek alphabet also had a role.\n\nAll the paleohispanic scripts, with the exception of the Greco-Iberian alphabet, share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the occlusives, and monophonemic value for the rest of the consonants and vowels. In a writing system they are neither alphabets nor syllabaries, but are rather mixed scripts that are normally identified as semi-syllabaries. The basic signary contains 28 signs: 5 vowels, 15 syllabic and 8 consonantic (one lateral, two sibilants, two rhotic and three nasals). The northeastern script was very nearly deciphered in 1922 by Manuel Gómez-Moreno Martínez, who systematically linked the syllabic signs with the occlusive values. The decipherment was based on the existence of a large number of coin legends (some of them bearing Latin inscriptions) that could easily be linked to ancient place names known from Roman and Greek sources. There are two variants of the northeastern Iberian script: the dual variant is almost exclusive to the ancient inscriptions from the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE and its distinctive characteristic is the use of the dual system. This system was discovered by Joan Maluquer de Motes in 1968 and allows differentiation of the occlusive signs (dentals and velars) between voiced and unvoiced by the use of an additional stroke. The simple sign represents the voiced value whilst the complex sign represents the unvoiced value. The non-dual variant is almost exclusive of the modern inscriptions from the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE. \n\nThe inscriptions that use the northeastern Iberian script have been found mainly in the northeastern quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula: largely along the coast from Roussillon to Alicante, but also with a deep penetration in the Ebro Valley. The northeastern Iberian inscriptions have been found on different object types (silver and bronze coins, silver and ceramic recipients, lead plaques, mosaics, amphores, stones (steles), spindle-whorls etc.), representing 95% of the total finds (over 2000 items), and nearly all the scripts were written from left to right. The oldest northeastern Iberian script date to the 4th or maybe the 5th century BCE. The modern ones date from the end of the 1st century BCE or maybe the beginning of the 1st century CE.\n\nIn recent years four northeastern Iberian abecedaries or signaries have been published: the Castellet de Bernabé signary, the Tos Pelat signary, the Ger signary and the Bolvir signary, all of them belonging to the dual variant of the script.\n\n\n\n"}

This strain of \"Flavobacterium\" sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon-eating bacteria, and the enzymes used to digest the man-made molecules became popularly known as nylonase.\n\nIn 1975, a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of \"Flavobacterium\", living in ponds containing waste water from a nylon factory, that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture, such as the linear dimer of 6-aminohexanoate. These substances are not known to have existed before the invention of nylon in 1935.\n\nFurther study revealed that the three enzymes the bacteria were using to digest the byproducts were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by other \"Flavobacterium\" strains (or, for that matter, any other bacteria), and not effective on any material other than the manmade nylon byproducts.\n\nThis discovery led geneticist Susumu Ohno in a paper published in April 1984 to speculate that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a gene duplication event with a frameshift mutation. Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved this way.\n\nA 2007 paper that described a series of studies by a team led by Seiji Negoro of the University of Hyogo, Japan, suggested that in fact no frameshift mutation was involved in the evolution of the 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase. However, many other genes have been discovered which did evolve by gene duplication followed by a frameshift mutation affecting at least part of the gene.\n\nA 1995 paper showed that scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacterium, \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients. The \"P. aeruginosa\" strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original \"Flavobacterium\" strain.\n\nAs described in a 1983 publication, other scientists were able to get the ability to generate the enzymes to transfer from the \"Flavobacterium\" strain to a strain of \"E. coli\" bacteria via a plasmid transfer.\n\nThere is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. More importantly, the enzyme involved was produced by a mutation completely randomizing the original gene. Despite this, the new gene still had a novel, albeit weak, catalytic capacity. This is seen as a good example of how mutations easily can provide the raw material for evolution by natural selection.\n\n\n"}

Bush and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the early 1990s, purporting to describe the economic benefit of a decrease in defense spending. It is used primarily in discussions relating to the guns versus butter theory. The term was frequently used at the end of the Cold War, when many Western nations significantly cut military spending (such as Britain's Options for Change defence review).\n\nWhile economies do undergo a recession after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a \"peace dividend\" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates. The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.\n\nA political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the Cold War involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in Western Europe and in the Russian Federation. The United States, whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999, has dramatically increased it after September 11, 2001 to fund conflicts like the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq.\n\n\"Peace dividend\" can also refer to the improved economy in Northern Ireland after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n"}
{"id": "364338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364338", "title": "Respect", "text": "Respect\n\nRespect is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important, or held in high esteem or regard; it conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities; and it is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.\n\nSome people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect include simple words and phrases like \"thank you\" in the West, simple physical gestures like a slight bow in the East, a smile, or direct eye contact, or a simple handshake.\n\nRespect is shown in many different languages by following certain grammatical conventions, especially in referring to individuals.\n\nAn honorific is a word or expression (often a pronoun) that shows respect when used in addressing or referring to a person or animal.\n\nTypically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific first person forms (like \"your most humble servant\" or \"this unworthy person\") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.\n\nFor instance, it is disrespectful to not use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific \"san\" can be used when speaking English.\n\nIn China it is rude to call someone by their first name unless you have known them for a long period of time. In work-related situations, people address each other by their title. At home people often refer to each other by nicknames or terms of kinship.\nIn the Chinese culture, individuals often address their friends as juniors and seniors even if they are just a few months younger or older. When a Chinese person asks someone their age they often do this so they know how to address the person.\n\nIn Islamic cultures around the world, there are many ways to show respect to people. For example, it is recommended to kiss the hands of parents, grandparents and teachers. Also, it is narrated in the sayings of Muhammad that if a person looks at the faces of parents and teachers with a smile, he will definitely be rewarded by Allah with success and happiness.\n\nIn India, it is customary that, out of respect, when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (considered to be a manifestations of Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge) or another person's leg, it will be followed by an apology in the form of a single hand gesture (Pranāma) with the right hand, where the offending person first touches the object with the finger tips and then the forehead and/or chest. This also counts for money, which is considered to be a manifestation of the goddess of wealth Lakshmi. Pranāma, or the touching of feet in Indian culture is a sign of respect. For instance, when a child is greeting his or her grandparent, they typically will touch their hands to their grandparents' feet. In Indian culture, it is believed that the feet are a source of power and love.\n\nIn many African/West Indian descent communities and some non-African//West Indian descent communities, respect can be signified by the touching of fists.\n\nMany gestures or physical acts that are common in the West can be considered disrespectful in Japan. For instance, one should not point directly at someone. When greeting someone or thanking them, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow lower than the person with higher status. The duration and level of the bow depends on many factors such as age and status. Some signs of physical respect apply to women only. If a woman does not wear cosmetics or a brassiere, it is possible that she will be considered unprofessional or others may think she does not care about the situation.\n\nUnlike Japanese culture, it is not necessary in Chinese culture to bow to one another as a greeting or parting gesture. Bowing is generally reserved as a sign of respect for elders and ancestors. When bowing, they place the fist of the right hand in the palm of their left at stomach level. The deeper the bow, the more respect they are showing.\n\nIn Chinese culture, there is not much participation in physical contact, especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual, thus disrespectful. It is considered rude to slap, pat, or put one's arm around the shoulders of another. However, affection in same-sex friendships in East Asia is much more pronounced than in the West. Same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another, holding hands, and other signs of physical affection.\n\nIt is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.\n\nTraditionally, there was not much hand-shaking in Chinese culture. However, this gesture is now widely practiced among men, especially when greeting Westerners or other foreigners. Many Westerners may find Chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak, but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect.\n\nKowtowing, or kneeling and bowing so deeply that one's forehead is touching the floor, is practiced during worship at temples. Kowtowing is a powerful gesture reserved mainly for honoring the dead or offering deep respect at a temple.\n\nMany codes of behavior revolve around young people showing respect to older people. Like in many cultures, younger Chinese individuals are expected to defer to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. Sometimes when an older person enters a room, everyone stands. People are often introduced from oldest to youngest. Often time, younger people will go out of their way to open doors for their elders and not cross their legs in front of them. The older you are the more respect you are expected to be treated with.\n\nIn many indigenous American societies the perspective on respect differs slightly because it serves as an important concept valued in their culture's context. Aside from meaning positive feelings of esteem or deference is also viewed as a moral value that teaches indigenous individuals about their culture. In addition, this moral value is treated as a process that influences certain participation in the community and also helps the individual develop and become integrated into their culture's community. During childhood is when this value of respect is taught because indigenous children participating in and learning about their community is an important aspect of the culture.\n\nRespect as a form of behavior and participation is especially important in childhood as it serves as a basis of how the child must conduct themselves in their community. Children engage in mature activities such as cooking for the family, cleaning and sweeping the house, caring for infant peers, and crop work. Indigenous children learn to view their participation in these activities are a representation of respect. Through his manner of participation of activities of respect is how children not only learn about culture but also practice it as well.\n\nThe Christian faith specifically recognizes respect for Authority throughout the Bible, including parental authority (Ten Commandments), civil authority and divine authority.\nFirst of all, then, I urge that entreaties \"and\" prayers, petitions \"and\" thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These animals are called \"secondarily aquatic\" because although their ancestors lived on land for hundreds of millions of years, they all originally descended from aquatic animals (see Evolution of tetrapods). These ancestral tetrapods had never left the water, and were thus primarily aquatic, like modern fishes. Secondary aquatic adaptations tend to develop in early speciation as the animal ventures into water in order to find available food. As successive generations spend more time in the water, natural selection causes the acquisition of more adaptations. Animals of later generations may spend the majority of their life in the water, coming ashore for mating. Finally, fully adapted animals may take to mating and birthing in water.\n\n\"Archelon\" is a type of giant sea turtle dating from the Cretaceous Period, now long extinct. Its smaller cousins survive as the sea turtles of today.\n\n\"Mesosaurus\" (and other mesosaurids) were another group of anapsid reptiles to secondarily return to the sea, eschewing shells, and are also long extinct.\n\nLiving at the same time as, but not closely related to, dinosaurs, the mosasaurs resembled crocodiles but were more strongly adapted to marine life. They became extinct 66 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. \n\nModern diapsids which have made their own adaptions to allow them to spend significant time in the water include marine iguanas and marine crocodiles. Sea snakes are extensively adapted to the marine environment, giving birth to live offspring in the same way as the Euryapsida (see below) and are largely incapable of terrestrial activity. The arc of their adaptation is evident by observing the primitive Laticauda genus, which must return to land to lay eggs.\n\nThese marine reptiles had ancestors who moved back into the oceans. In the case of ichthyosaurs adapting as fully as the dolphins they superficially resemble, even giving birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Euryapsida is now no longer considered a valid taxonomic group (Motani, 2009).\n\nDuring the Paleocene Epoch (about 66 - 55 million years ago), a group of wolf-like artiodactyls related to \"Pakicetus\" began pursuing an amphibious lifestyle in rivers or shallow seas. They were the ancestors of modern whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The cetacea are extensively adapted to marine life and cannot survive on land at all. Their adaptation can be seen in many unique physiognomic characteristics such as the dorsal blowhole, baleen teeth, and the cranial 'melon' organ used for aquatic echolocation. The closest extant terrestrial relative to the whale is the hippopotamus, which spends much of its time in the water and whose name literally means \"horse of the river\".\n\nThe ancestors of the dugong and manatees first appeared in the fossil record about 45 to 50 million years ago in the ocean.\n\nThe fossil records show that phocids existed 12 to 15 million years ago, and odobenids about 14 million years ago. Their common ancestor must have existed even earlier than that.\n\nAlthough polar bears spend most of their time on the ice rather than in the water, polar bears show the beginnings of aquatic adaptation to swimming (high levels of body fat and nostrils that are able to close), diving, and thermoregulation. Distinctly polar bear fossils can be dated to about 100,000 years ago. The polar bear has thick fur and layers of fat on its body to protect it from the cold.\n\nProponents of the aquatic ape hypothesis believe that part of human evolution includes some aquatic adaptation, which has been said to explain human hairlessness, bipedalism, increased subcutaneous fat, descended larynx, vernix caseosa, a hooded nose and various other physiological and anatomical changes.

When people are asked to remember information when it is related in some way to themselves, the recall rate can be improved.\n\nIn 1955, George Kelly published his theory about how humans create personal constructs. This was a more general cognitive theory based on the idea that each individual's psychological processes are influenced by the way they anticipate events. This lays the groundwork for the ideas of personal constructs. Attribution theory is an explanation of the way people attribute the causes of behavior and events, which also involved creating a construct of self, since people can explain things related to themselves differently from the same thing happening to someone else. Related to the attribution theory, the fundamental attribution error is an explanation of when an individual explains someone's given behavior in a situation through emphasis on internal characteristics (personality) rather than considering the situation's external factors. Studies such as one by Jones, Sensenig, and Haley corroborated the idea that the self has a special construct, by simply asking experiment subjects to describe their \"most significant characteristics\". The results showed that the majority of responses were based on positive characteristics such as \"sensitive\", \"intelligent\", and \"friendly\". This ties in very well with other cognitive phenomena such as illusory superiority, in that it is a well observed fact that people rate themselves differently from how they rate others. In 2012, Stanley B. Klein published an article on the self and memory and how it relates to the self-reference effect. In recent years, studies on the self-reference effect have shifted from identifying mechanisms to using the self-reference as a research tool in understanding the nature of memory. Klein discusses words encoded with respect to oneself (the self-relevance effect) are recalled more often than words that are unrelated to the self.\n\nIn Japan, regarding memory, people who showed higher altruism tend not to exhibit self-reference effect.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in cognitive neuroscience studies that focus on the concept of the self. These studies were developed in hopes of determining if there are certain brain regions that can account for the encoding advantages involved in the self-reference effect. A great deal of research has been focused on several regions of the brain collectively identified as the cortical midline region. Brain imaging studies have raised the question of whether neural activity in cortical midline regions is self-specific. A quantitative meta-analysis that included 87 studies, representing 1433 participants, was conducted to discuss these questions. The analysis uncovered activity within several cortical midline structures in activities in which participants performed tasks involving the concept of self. Most studies that report such midline activations use tasks that are geared towards uncovering neural processes that are related to social or psychological aspects of the self, such as self-referential judgments, self-appraisal, and judgments of personality traits. Also, in addition to their perceived role in several forms of self-representation, cortical midline structures are also involved in the processing of social relationships and recognizing personally familiar others. Studies that show midline activations during understanding of social interactions between others or ascribing social traits to others (impression formation) typically require subjects to reference the mental state of others.\n\nThere are several areas within the cortical midline structure that are believed to be associated with the self-reference effect. One of the more active regions involved in the self-reference effect appears to be the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the area of the brain that is believed to be involved in the planning of complex behavior and the expression and regulation of personality characteristics in social situations. The implication that the prefrontal cortex is involved in the regulation of unique internal personality characteristics illustrates how it may be an important component of the self-reference effect. The medial prefrontal cortex in both hemispheres has been proposed as a site of the \"self model\" which is a theoretical construct made of essential features such as feelings of continuity and unity as well as experience of agency.\n\nThe idea of the self-reference effect being linked to the medial prefrontal cortex stems from several experiments attempting to locate the mechanisms involved in the self-referencing process. Experiments in which participants were assigned tasks that required them to reflect on, or introspect about their own mental states showed activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. For example, activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been observed in tasks in which participants report on their own personalities or preferences, adopt a first person perspective, or reflect on their current affective state. Similar activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is displayed in cases where participants show the memory advantage that emerges when items are encoded in a self-relevant manner. During various functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests conducted while participants were performing self-referential tasks, there was a consistent showing of increases in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals in the ventral medial and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. Measuring BOLD signals is necessary for a sound interpretation of fMRI signals, as BOLD fMRI reflects a complex monitoring of changes in cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and blood oxygenation.\n\nIn addition to areas of the prefrontal cortex, research has suggested that there are areas within the parietal lobe that also play a role in activating the self-reference effect. During fMRI given during self-referential tasks there also appeared to be increases in BOLD signals within the medial and lateral parietal cortex To further determine whether or not the medial parietal lobe plays a role in self-referencing, participants were subjected to transcranial magnetic stimulation over the region. Stimulation over this region produced a decrease in the ability of participants to retrieve previous judgments of mental self when compared to the retrieval of judgment of others.\n\nThe development of a sense of self and the understanding that one is separate and uniquely different from others is vital in the development of the self-reference effect advantage. As young children grow, their sense of self and understanding of the world around them is continuously increasing. Although this occurs at different stages for each child, research has shown rather early development of the self-reference advantage. Research focusing on the recall abilities of children have shown the self-referencing advantage in children as young as five years old. Language development appears to play a significant role in the development and use of the self-reference effect. Verbal labeling is among the first strategic behaviors shown by young children in order to enhance memory, and as children progress in age and language development, their performance on memory tasks involving self-referencing increases. A study done in 2011 on preschoolers found that observations on children as young as three years old suggests that the self-reference effect is apparent in event memory, by their ability to self-recognize.\n\nLike children, the continuous development of a self-concept is related to the development of self-referencing in individuals. The relationships formed with intimate others over the lifespan appear to have an effect on self-referencing in relation to memory. The extent to which we include others in our self-concept has been a topic of particular interest for social psychologists. Theories of intimacy and personal relationships might suggest that the self-reference effect is affected by the closeness of a relationship with the other used as a target. Some researchers define closeness as an extension of self into other and suggest that one's cognitive processes about a close other develop in a way so as to include that person as part of the self. Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated that the memorial advantage afforded to self-referenced material can be diminished or eliminated when the comparison target is an intimate other such as a parent, friend, or spouse The capacity for utilizing the self-reference effect remains relatively high throughout the lifespan, even well into old age. Normally functioning older adults can benefit from self-referencing. Ageing is marked by cognitive impairments in a number of domains including long-term memory, but older adults' memory performance is malleable. Memory strategies and orientations that engage \"deep\" encoding processes benefit older adults. For example, older adults exhibit increased recall when using self-generated strategies that rely on personally relevant information (e.g., important birthdates) relative to other mnemonic strategies However, research has shown that there are some differences between older adults and younger adults use of the self-reference advantage. Like young adults, older adults exhibit superior recognition for self-referenced items. But the amount of cognitive resources an individual has influence on how much older adults benefit from self referencing. Self-referencing improves older adult's memory, but its benefits are restricted regardless of the social and personally relevant nature of the task. A reason for this change in self referencing may be the change in brain activation that has been observed in older adults when studying self-referencing. Older adults showed more activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and along the cingulate gyrus than young adults. Because these regions often are associated with self-referential processing, these results suggest that older adults' mnemonic boost for positive information may stem from an increased tendency to process this information in relation to themselves. It has been proposed that this \"positivity shift\" may occur because older adults put more emphasis on emotion regulation goals than do young adults, with older adults having a greater motivation to derive emotional meaning from life and to maintain positive affect.\n\nStudents are often challenged when faced with the attempt to recall memories. It is therefore import to understand the effects of self-reference encoding for students and beneficial ways it can increase their recall of information. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of, self-referent encoding.\n\nRogers, Kuiper, and Kirker (1977) performed one of the first studies examining the self-reference effect making it a foundational article. The focus of the study was to identify the importance of the self and how it is implicated when processing personal information. The self-reference effect has been considered a robust encoding strategy and has been effective over the past 30 years (Gutches et al., 2007). The process behind this study was to gather students and divide them into four different task groups and they would be asked to give a yes or no answer to a trait adjective being presented to them. The four tasks that were used were: structural, phonemic, semantic, and self-reference. There were some different theories that support the study. The personality theory stressed that the observer's network when looking at the trait adjectives is an essential part of how they process personal information Hastorf et al. (1970). Another theory that supports this study is the attribution theory. It is another example where a person's organization traits fit with the self-reference effect Jones et al. (1971). The self is visualized as a schema that is involved with processing personal information, interpretation, and memories which is considered a powerful and effective process (Rogers et al., 1977).\n\nGutchess, Kensinger, and Schacter (2007) performed a study where they used age as a factor when looking at the self-reference effect. The first and second experiment looks at the young and older adults and they are presented with encoded adjectives and they must decide if it describes them. The third experiment is deciding if they found these traits desirable towards themselves. The age difference was shown effective with the self-reference effect leaving the older adults showing superiority of recognition for self-referenced items that were relative. Although, self-referencing the older adults did not have the same restoring level as the younger adults. A major factor that played in this study was the availability of cognitive resources. When there was a greater availability of cognitive resources, the ability to enhance memory similarly for both young and older adults diverged from socioemotional processing (Gutches et al., 2007).\n\nHartlep and Forsyth (2001) performed a study using two different approaches when studying for an exam. The first approach was the survey, question, read, reflect, recite, and review method which is called the SQR4. The other method was the self-reference method. The third group was a controlled group and received no special instructions on their studying process (Hartlep & Forsyth, 2001). This study is considered an applied study. People who have a more elaborative cognitive framework, the better they will be able to retrieve a memory. The most elaborative cognitive framework someone can have is knowledge of themselves (Hartlep & Forsyth, 2001). The self-reference effect is viable when having strict lab conditions. When students are studying, if they can see the material as an elaboration of what they already remember or can relate to personal experiences, their recall would be enhanced (Hartlep & Forsyth, 2001). Although, the self-reference method can enhance recall of memory in certain instances, unfortunately for this study, there were no significant differences between the two study methods.\n\nSerbun, Shih and Gutchess (2011) performed a study involving the effects of general and specific memory when using the self-reference effect. The study created a gap in research due to the experiments being tested. The first experiment uses visuals details of objects where the second and third experiment use verbal memory to assess the self-reference effect. The self-reference effect enhances both general and specific memory and can improve the accuracy and richness of a memory (Serbun et al., 2011). We know how the self-reference effect works, but instead of using trait adjectives to assess recall, we are looking at trait adjectives. The results from the experiments show that self-referencing does not function only through the increase in familiarity or general memory for the object, but enhances memory for details of an event. This likely draws on more recollected processes. This information supports that self-referencing is effective of encoding a rich, detailed memory towards not only general memory, but specific memories.\n\n(Nakao et al., 2012) performed a study to show the relation between the self-reference effect and people that are highly in altruism and low in altruism. This all starts with the medical prefrontal cortex (MPFC). People who are high in altruism did not show the self-reference effect compared to the participants low in altruism. The participants who frequently chose the altruistic behavior refer to the social desirability as a backboard (Nakoa et al., 2012). The relation the self-reference effect and altruism is the MPFC. When using the self-reference effect, people who are low in altruism, the same part of the brain is being used. Whereas the same is for people who are high in altruism when using social desirability. Social desirability ties into the different types of memory enhancement can vary for individual differences of past experiences. People's individual differences can show similar effects as the self-reference effect (Nakoa et al., 2012).\n\nThe self-reference effect is a rich and powerful encoding process that can be used multiple ways. The self-reference effect shows better results over the semantic method when processing personal information. Processing personal information can be distinguished and recalled differently with age. The older the subject, the more rich and vivid the memory can be due to the amount of information the brain has processed. The self-reference just as effective as the SQR4 method when study for exams, but the self-reference method is preferred. Defining general and specific memories using objects, verbal cues, etc. can be effective when using the self-reference effect. When using these different method, the same part of the brain is being active resulting in relation and better recall. It was expected that participants would recall the most number of words from the self-referent list rather than from the semantic or structural lists and more words from the semantic list than from the structural list. It was also expected that for the words encoded in the self-referent condition, fewer words would be recalled by participants in the high altruism group than in the low altruism group.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2255858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2255858", "title": "Somatic marker hypothesis", "text": "Somatic marker hypothesis\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis, formulated by Alice, proposes that emotional processes guide (or bias) behavior, particularly decision-making.\n\n\"Somatic markers\" are feelings in the body that are associated with emotions, such as the association of rapid heartbeat with anxiety or of nausea with disgust. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers strongly influence subsequent decision-making. Within the brain, somatic markers are thought to be processed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the amygdala. The hypothesis has been tested in experiments using the Iowa gambling task.\n\nIn economic theory, human decision-making is often modeled as being devoid of emotions, involving only logical reasoning based on cost-benefit calculations. In contrast, the somatic marker hypothesis proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.\n\nPatients with frontal lobe damage, such as Phineas Gage, provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of working memory, attention, and language comprehension and expression.\n\nvmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions. This led Antonio Damasio to hypothesize that decision-making deficits following vmPFC damage result from the inability to use emotions to help guide future behavior based on past experiences. Consequently, vmPFC damage forces those afflicted to rely on slow and laborious cost-benefit analyses for every given choice situation.\n\nWhen individuals make decisions, they must assess the incentive value of the choices available to them, using cognitive and emotional processes. When the individuals face complex and conflicting choices, they may be unable to decide using only cognitive processes, which may become overloaded. Emotions, consequently, are hypothesized to guide decision-making.\n\nEmotions, as defined by Damasio, are changes in both body and brain states in response to stimuli. Physiological changes (such as muscle tone, heart rate, endocrine activity, posture, facial expression, and so forth) occur in the body and are relayed to the brain where they are transformed into an emotion that tells the individual something about the stimulus that they have encountered. Over time, emotions and their corresponding bodily changes, which are called \"somatic markers\", become associated with particular situations and their past outcomes.\n\nWhen making subsequent decisions, these somatic markers and their evoked emotions are consciously or unconsciously associated with their past outcomes, and influence decision-making in favor of some behaviors instead of others. For instance, when a somatic marker associated with a positive outcome is perceived, the person may feel happy and thereby motivated to pursue that behavior. When a somatic marker associated with the negative outcome is perceived, the person may feel sad, which acts as an internal alarm to warn the individual to avoid that course of action. These situation-specific somatic states based on, and reinforced by, past experiences help to guide behavior in favor of more advantageous choices, and therefore are adaptive.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, two distinct pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked by changes in the body that are projected to the brain – called the \"body loop\". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the fight-or-flight response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the emotions (imagining an unpleasant situation \"as-if\" you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus – called the \"as-if body loop\". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli without waiting for an event to actually occur. The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.\n\nIn an effort to produce a simple neuropsychological tool that would assess deficits in emotional processing, decision-making, and social skills of OMPFC-lesioned individuals, Bechara and collaborators created the Iowa gambling task. The task measures a form of emotion-based learning. Studies using the gambling task have found deficits in various neurological (such as amygdala and OMPFC lesions) and psychiatric populations (such as schizophrenia, mania, and drug abusers).\n\nThe Iowa gambling task is a computerized test in which participants are presented with four decks of cards from which they repeatedly choose. Each deck contains various amounts of rewards of either $50 or $100, and occasional losses that are greater in the decks with higher rewards. The participants do not know where the penalty cards are located, and are told to pick cards that will maximize their winnings. The most profitable strategy turns out to be to choose cards only from the small reward/small penalty decks, because although the reward is smaller, the penalty is proportionally much smaller than in the high reward/high penalty decks. Over the course of a session, most healthy participants come to adopt the profitable low-penalty deck strategy. Participants with brain damage, however, are unable to determine the better deck to choose from, and continue to choose from the high reward/high penalty decks.\n\nSince the Iowa gambling task measures participants' quickness in \"developing anticipatory emotional responses to guide advantageous choices\", it is helpful in testing the somatic marker hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, somatic markers give rise to anticipation of the emotional consequences of a decision being made. Consequently, persons who perform well on the task are thought to be aware of the penalty cards and of the negative emotions associated with drawing such cards, and to realize which deck is less likely to yield a penalty.\n\nThis experiment has been used to analyze the impairments suffered by people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which has been known to affect neural signaling of prospective rewards or punishments. Such persons perform less well on the task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to analyze the brain during the Iowa gambling task. The brain regions that were activated during the Iowa gambling task were also the ones hypothesized to be triggered by somatic markers during decision-making.\n\nDamasio has posited that the ability of humans to perform abstract thinking quickly and efficiently coincides with both the development of the ventromedial (VM) cortex and with the use of somatic markers to guide human behavior during evolution. Patients with damage to the VM cortices are more likely to engage in behaviors that negatively impact personal relationships in the distant future, but they never engage in actions that would lead to immediate harm to themselves or others. The evolution of the prefrontal cortex was associated with the ability to represent events that may occur in the future.\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis has been applied to trying to understand risky behaviors, such as risky sexual behavior and drug addiction.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, riskier sexual behaviors are more exhilarating and pleasurable, and therefore they are more likely to stimulate repetitive engagement in such behaviors. When this idea was tested in individuals who were infected with HIV and were substance dependent, differences were found between persons who scored well in the Iowa gambling test, and those who scored poorly. The high scorers showed a correlation between the amount of distress they reported having over their HIV status, and their acceptance of risk during sexual behavior – the greater the distress, the greater the risk that these people would take. The low scorers, on the other hand, showed no such correlation. These results were interpreted as indicating that persons with intact decision-making abilities are better able to rely on past emotional experiences when weighing risks, than are persons who are deficient in such abilities, and that acceptance of risk serves to ameliorate emotional distress.\n\nDrug abusers are thought to ignore the negative consequences of addiction while seeking drugs. According to the somatic marker hypothesis, such abusers are impaired in their ability to recall and consider past unpleasant experiences when weighing whether to consider drug seeking behaviors. Researchers analyzed the neuroendocrine responses of substance-dependent individuals and healthy individuals after being shown pleasant or unpleasant images. In response to unpleasant images, drug users showed decreased levels of several neuroendocrine markers, including norepinephrine, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Addicts showed lesser responses to both pleasant and unpleasant images, suggesting that they may have a diminished emotional response. Neuroimaging studies utilizing fMRI indicate that drug-related stimuli have the ability to activate brain regions involved in emotional evaluation and reward processing. When shown a film of people smoking cocaine, cocaine users showed greater activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, the right inferior parietal lobe, and the caudate nucleus than did non-users. Conversely, the cocaine users showed lesser activation when viewing a sex film than did non-users.\n\nSome researchers believe that the use of somatic markers (i.e., afferent feedback) would be a very inefficient method of influencing behavior. Damasio's notion of the \"as-if\" experience dependent feedback route, whereby bodily responses are re-represented utilizing the somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), also proposes an inefficient method of affecting explicit behavior. Rolls (1999) stated that; \"it would be very inefficient and noisy to place in the execution route a peripheral response, and transducers to attempt to measure that peripheral response, itself a notoriously difficult procedure\" (p. 73). Reinforcement association located in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, where the incentive value of stimuli is decoded, is sufficient to elicit emotion-based learning and to affect behavior via, for example, the orbitofrontal-striatal pathway. This process can occur via implicit or explicit processes.\n\nThe somatic marker hypothesis represents a model of how feedback from the body may contribute to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision-making in situations of complexity and uncertainty. Much of its supporting data comes from data taken from the Iowa gambling task. While the Iowa gambling task has proven to be an ecologically valid measure of decision-making impairment, there exist three assumptions that need to hold true. \n\nFirst, the claim that it assesses implicit learning as the reward/punishment design is inconsistent with data showing accurate knowledge of the task possibilities and that mechanisms such as working-memory appear to have a strong influence. Second, the claim that this knowledge occurs through preventive marker signals is not supported by competing explanations of the psychophysiology generated profile. Lastly, the claim that the impairment is due to a 'myopia for the future' is undermined by more plausible psychological mechanisms explaining deficits on the tasks such as reversal learning, risk-taking, and working-memory deficits. There may also be more variability in control performance than previously thought, thus complicating the interpretation of the findings. \n\nFurthermore, although the somatic marker hypothesis has accurately identified many of the brain regions involved in decision-making, emotion, and body-state representation, it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. There are many experiments that could be implemented to further test the somatic marker hypothesis. One way would be to develop variants of the Iowa gambling task that control some of the methodological issues and interpretation ambiguities generated. It may be a good idea to include removing the reversal learning confound, which would make the task more difficult to consciously comprehend. Additionally, causal tests of the somatic marker hypothesis could be practiced more insistently in a greater range of populations with altered peripheral feedback, like on patients with facial paralysis. \n\nIn conclusion, the somatic marker hypothesis needs to be tested in more experiments. Until a wider range of empirical approaches are employed in order to test the somatic marker hypothesis, it appears that the framework is simply an intriguing idea that is in need of some better supporting evidence. Despite these issues, the somatic marker hypothesis and the Iowa gambling task reestablish the notion that emotion has the potential to be a benefit as well as a problem during the decision-making process in humans.\n"}

There is often a formal distinction between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud: the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a thought bubble.\n\nOne of the earliest antecedents to the modern speech bubble were the \"speech scrolls\", wispy lines that connected first person speech to the mouths of the speakers in Mesoamerican art between 600 and 900 AD.\n\nIn Western graphic art, labels that reveal what a pictured figure is saying have appeared since at least the 13th century. These were in common European use by the early 16th century. Word balloons (also known as \"banderoles\") began appearing in 18th-century printed broadsides, and political cartoons from the American Revolution (including some published by Benjamin Franklin) often used them. They later fell out of fashion, but by 1904 had regained their popularity, although they were still considered novel enough to require explanation. With the development of the comics industry in the 20th century, the appearance of speech balloons has become increasingly standardized, though the formal conventions that have evolved in different cultures (USA as opposed to Japan, for example), can be quite distinct.\n\nRichard F. Outcault's Yellow Kid is generally credited as the first American comic strip character. His words initially appeared on his yellow shirt, but word balloons very much like those in use today were added almost immediately, as early as 1896. By the start of the 20th century, word balloons were ubiquitous, and since that time only a very few American comic strips and comic books have relied on captions, notably Hal Foster's \"Prince Valiant\" and the early \"Tarzan\" comic strip in the 1930s. In Europe, where text comics were more common, speech balloons slowly caught on with well known examples like Alain Saint-Ogan's \"Zig et Puce\" (1925), Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" (1929) and Rob-Vel's \"Spirou\" (1938).\n\nThe most common is the speech bubble. It comes in two forms for two circumstances: an in-panel character and an off-panel character. An in-panel character (one who is fully or mostly visible in the panel of the strip of comic that the reader is viewing) uses a bubble with a pointer, called a tail, directed towards the speaker.\n\nWhen one character has multiple balloons within a panel, often only the balloon nearest to the speaker's head has a tail, and the others are connected to it in sequence by narrow bands. This style is often used in Mad Magazine, due to its \"call-and-response\" dialogue-based humor.\n\nAn off-panel character (the comic book equivalent of being \"off screen\") has several options, some of them rather unconventional. The first is a standard speech bubble with a tail pointing toward the speaker's position. The second option, which originated in manga, has the tail pointing \"into\" the bubble, instead of out. (This tail is still pointing towards the speaker.) The third option replaces the tail with a sort of bottleneck that connects with the side of the panel. It can be seen in the works of Marjane Satrapi (author of \"Persepolis\").\n\nIn American comics, a bubble without a tail means that the speaker is not merely outside the reader's field of view but invisible to the viewpoint character, often as an unspecified member of a crowd.\n\nCharacters distant (in space or time) from the scene of the panel can still speak, in squared bubbles without a tail; this usage, equivalent to voice-over in film, is not uncommon in American comics for dramatic contrast. In contrast to captions, the corners of such balloons never coincide with those of the panel; for further distinction they often have a double outline, a different background color, or quotation marks.\n\nThought bubbles come in two forms: the chain thought bubble and the \"fuzzy\" bubble.\n\nThe chain thought bubble is the almost universal symbol for thinking in cartoons. It consists of a large, cloud-like bubble containing the text of the thought, with a chain of increasingly smaller circular bubbles leading to the character. Some artists use an elliptical bubble instead of a cloud-shaped one.\n\nOften animal characters like Snoopy and Garfield \"talk\" using thought bubbles. Thought bubbles may also be used in circumstances when a character is gagged or otherwise unable to speak.\n\nAnother, less conventional thought bubble has emerged: the \"fuzzy\" thought bubble. Used in manga (by such artists as Ken Akamatsu), the fuzzy bubble is roughly circular in shape (generally), but the edge of the bubble is not a line but a collection of spikes close to each other, creating the impression of fuzziness. Fuzzy thought bubbles do not use tails, and are placed near the character who is thinking. This has the advantage of reflecting the TV equivalent effect: something said with an echo.\n\nWriters and artists can refuse to use thought bubbles, expressing the action through spoken dialogue and drawing; they are sometimes seen as an inefficient method of expressing thought because they are attached directly to the head of the thinker, unlike methods such as caption boxes, which can be used both as an expression of thought and narration while existing in an entirely different panel from the character thinking. However, they are restricted to the current viewpoint character. An example is Alan Moore and David Lloyd's \"V for Vendetta\", wherein during one chapter, a monologue expressed in captions serves not only to express the thoughts of a character but also the mood, status and actions of three others.\n\nThe shape of a speech balloon can be used to convey further information. Common ones include the following:\n\nCaptions are generally used for narration purposes, such as showing location and time, or conveying editorial commentary. They are generally rectangular and positioned near the edge of the panel. Often they are also colored to indicate the difference between themselves and the word balloons used by the characters, which are almost always white. Increasingly in modern comics, captions are frequently used to convey an internal monologue or typical speech.\n\nSome characters and strips use highly unconventional methods of communication. Perhaps the most notable is the Yellow Kid, an early American comic strip. His (but not the other characters') words would appear on his large, smock-like shirt. A short-run American animated TV series of the early 1980s used this same concept, but with changing phrases on the \"T-shirts\" worn by the animal-based characters, depending on the characters' thoughts. \n\nAlso noteworthy are the many variations on the form created by Dave Sim for his comic \"Cerebus the Aardvark\". Depending on the shape, size, and position of the bubble, as well as the texture and shape of the letters within it, Sim could convey large amounts of information about the speaker. This included separate bubbles for different states of mind (drunkenness, etc.), for echoes, and a special class of bubbles for one single floating apparition.\n\nAn early pioneer in experimenting with many different types of speech balloons and lettering for different types of speech was Walt Kelly, in his \"Pogo\" strip. Deacon Mushrat speaks in blackletter, P.T. Bridgeport speaks in circus posters, Sarcophagus MacAbre speaks in condolence cards, \"Mr. Pig\" (a take on Nikita Khrushchev) speaks in faux Cyrillic, etc.\n\nIn the famous French comic series \"Asterix\", Goscinny and Uderzo use bubbles without tails to indicate a distant or unseen speaker. They have also experimented with using different types of lettering for characters of different nationalities to indicate they speak a different language that Asterix may not understand; Goths speak in blackletter, Greeks in angular lettering (though always understood by the Gaulish main characters, so it is more of an accent than a language), Norse with \"Nørdic åccents\", Egyptians in faux hieroglyphs (depictive illustrations and rebuses), etc. Another experiment with speech bubbles was exclusive to one book, \"Asterix and the Roman Agent\". The agent in question is a vile manipulator who creates discord in a group of people with a single innocent-sounding comment. His victims start quarreling and ultimately fighting each other while speaking in green-colored speech bubbles.\n\nFont variation is a common tactic in comics. \"The Sandman\" series, written by Neil Gaiman and lettered by Todd Klein, features many characters whose speech bubbles are written with a font that is exclusive to them. For examples, the main character, the gloomy Dream, speaks in wavy-edged bubbles, completely black, with similarly wavy white lettering. His sister, the scatterbrained and whimsical Delirium speaks in bubbles in a many-colored explosive background with uneven lettering, and the irreverent raven Matthew speaks in a shaky angular kind of bubble with scratchy lettering. Other characters, such as John Dee, have special shapes of bubbles for their own.\n\nIn \"Mad\"'s recurring \"Monroe\" comic strip, certain words are written larger or in unusual fonts for emphasis.\n\nIn manga, there is a tendency to include the speech necessary for the storyline in balloons, while small scribbles outside the balloons add side comments, often used for irony or to show that they're said in a much smaller voice. Satsuki Yotsuba in the manga series Negima is notable because she speaks almost \"entirely\" in side scribble.\n\nSpeech bubbles are used not only to include a character's words, but also emotions, voice inflections and unspecified language.\n\nOne of the universal emblems of the art of comics is the use of a single punctuation mark to depict a character's emotions, much more efficiently than any possible sentence. A speech bubble with a single big question mark (?) (often drawn by hand, not counted as part of the lettering) denotes confusion or ignorance. An exclamation mark (!) indicates surprise or terror. This device is broadly used in the European comic tradition, the Belgian artist Hergé's \"The Adventures of Tintin\" series being a good example. Sometimes, the punctuation marks stand alone above the character's head, with no bubble needed.\n\nIn manga, the ellipsis (i.e. three dots) is also used to express silence in a much more significant way than the mere absence of bubbles. This is specially seen when a character is supposed to say something, to indicate a stunned silence or when a sarcastic comment is expected by the reader. The ellipsis, along with the big drop of sweat on the character's temple—usually depicting shame, confusion, or embarrassment caused by other people's actions—is one of the Japanese graphic symbols that have taken root in comics all around the world, although they are still rare in Western tradition. Japanese even has a sound effect for \"deafening silence\", .\n\nIn many comic books, words that would be foreign to the narration but are displayed in translation for the reader are surrounded by angle brackets or chevrons .\n\nGilbert Hernandez's series about Palomar is written in English, but supposed to take place mainly in a Hispanic country. Thus, what's supposed to be representations of Spanish speech is written without brackets, but occasional actual English speech is written within brackets, to indicate that it is unintelligible to the main Hispanophone characters in the series.\n\nSome comics will have the actual foreign language in the speech balloon, with the translation as a footnote; this is done with Latin aphorisms in \"Asterix\".\n\nAnother convention is to put the foreign speech in a distinctive lettering style; for example, \"Asterix\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Goths speak in blackletter.\n\nSince the Japanese language uses two writing directionalities (vertical, which is the traditional direction; and horizontal, as most other languages), manga has a convention of representing translated foreign speech as horizontal text.\n\nIt is a convention in American comics that the sound of a snore is represented as a series of Z's, dating back at least to Rudolph Dirks' early 20th-century strip \"The Katzenjammer Kids\". This practice has even been reduced to a single letter Z, so that a speech bubble with this letter standing all alone (again, drawn by hand rather than a font type) means the character is sleeping in most humorous comics. This can be seen, for instance, in Charles Schulz's \"Peanuts\" comic strips.\n\nOriginally, the resemblance between the 'z' sound and that of a snore seemed exclusive to the English language, but the spread of American comics has made it a frequent feature in other countries. An exception to this is in Japanese manga, where the usual symbol for sleep is a large bubble coming out of the character's nose.\n\nSinging characters usually have musical notes drawn into their word balloons. Archie Comics' Melody Valentine, a character in their \"Josie and the Pussycats\" comic, has musical notes drawn into her word balloons at all times, to convey that she speaks in a sing-song voice.\n\nThe above-mentioned Albert Uderzo in the \"Asterix\" series decorates speech bubbles with beautiful flowers depicting an extremely soft, sweet voice (usually preceding a violent outburst by the same character).\n\nA stormy cloud with a rough lightning sticking out of it, either in a bubble or just floating above the character's head as a modified 'cloudy' thought bubble, depicts anger, not always verbally expressed.\n\nLight bulbs are sometimes used when the character comes up with an idea or solution to a problem.\n\nIn the Western world, it is common to replace profanity with a string of nonsense symbols (&%$@*$#), sometimes called grawlixes. In comics that are usually addressed to children or teenagers, bad language is censored by replacing it with more or less elaborate drawings and expressionistic symbols. For example, instead of calling someone a swine, a pig is drawn in the speech bubble.\n\nOne example is the Spanish \"Mortadelo\" series, created by Francisco Ibáñez. Although not specifically addressed to children, \"Mortadelo\" was born during Francisco Franco's dictatorship, when censorship was the order of the day and the slightest attempt of rough language was prohibited. When Ibáñez's characters are angry, donkey heads, lightning, lavatories, billy goats and even faux Japanese characters are often seen in their bubbles.\n\nWhen \"Mortadelo\" was portrayed on film by Spanish director Javier Fesser in 2003, one of the critiques made to his otherwise successful adaptation was the character's use of words that never appeared in the comics. Fesser claimed: \"When you see a bubble speech containing a lightning falling on a pig, what do you imagine the character's saying?\"\n\nIn order for comic strip and graphic novel dialogue to make sense, it has to be read in order. Thus, conventions have evolved in the order in which the communication bubbles are read. The individual bubbles are read in the order of the language. For example, in English, the bubbles are read from left to right in a panel, while in Japanese, it is the other way around. Sometimes the bubbles are \"stacked\", with two characters having multiple bubbles, one above the other. Such stacks are read from the top down. Poor use of speech balloons can unintentionally make the proper reading order ambiguous, confusing the reader.\n\nTraditionally, a cartoonist or occupational letterer would draw in all the individual letters in the balloons and sound effects by hand. A modern alternative, used by most comics today and universal in English-translated manga, is to letter with computer programs. The fonts used usually emulate the style of hand-lettering.\n\nTraditionally, most mainstream comic books are lettered entirely in upper-case, with a few exceptions:\n\nWhen hand-lettering, upper-case lettering saves time and effort because it requires drawing only three guidelines, while mixed-case lettering requires five.\n\nIn a few comics, uppercase and lowercase are used as in ordinary writing. Since the mid-1980s, mixed case lettering has gradually become more widely used in mainstream books. Some comics, such as \"Pearls Before Swine\", also use lowercase speech to mark a distinctive accent (in this case, the male crocodiles’ accented speech, opposed to all other characters who use standard uppercase speech).\n\nFrom 2002–2004, Marvel Comics experimented with mixed-case lettering in all its books. Most mainstream titles have since returned to traditional all upper-case lettering.\n\nIn many comics, although the lettering is entirely in capital letters, serif versions of \"I\" are used exclusively where a capital I would appear in normal print text, and a sanserif (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places. This reduces confusion with the number one, and also serves to indicate when the personal pronoun \"I\" is meant. This lettering convention can be seen in computer fonts such as Blambot's \"DigitalStrip.ttf\" and \"AnimeAce.ttf\" fonts, which make no other distinction between lower- and uppercase letters.\n\nIn several occasions, comics artists have used balloons (or similar narrative devices) as if they have true substance, usually for humorous meta-like purposes. In \"Peanuts\", for example, the notes played by Schroeder occasionally take substance and are used in various ways, including Christmas decorations or perches for birds. Sometimes balloons can be influenced by the strip's environment: in the Italian strip \"Sturmtruppen\" they freeze and crack when the temperature is very low, or an Archie comic strip where two men from Alaska remarked on how cold it was, by saying the speech balloons froze as they said them, and the words had to be thawed out to be heard.\n\nIn the Flemish \"Suske en Wiske\" series, on one occasion a thought bubble full of mathematical formulas is cut open with scissors and its contents emptied in a bag, to be saved for later (in a manner not unlike the pensieve in the Harry Potter series). In the same series, speech balloons are occasionally even held and blown up to function as actual balloons or the words of the speech bubble are occasionally shown coming out the side of the speech bubble, to signify that the speaker is moving so fast that their words can't keep up with them, i.e. at supersonic speed.\n\nIn the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", the last words of a murdered Toon (cartoon character) are found under his body in the form of a speech balloon.\n\nMany digital artists generate speech balloons with general-purpose illustration software. Products like Comic Book Creator for Microsoft Windows, Comic Life for Mac OS X and Windows target the non-professional end of the market.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162947", "title": "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre", "text": "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre\n\nThe St. Bartholomew's Day massacre () in 1572 was a targeted group of assassinations and a wave of Catholic mob violence, directed against the Huguenots (French Calvinist Protestants) during the French Wars of Religion. Traditionally believed to have been instigated by Queen Catherine de' Medici, the mother of King Charles IX, the massacre took place a few days after the wedding day (18 August) of the king's sister Margaret to the Protestant Henry III of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France). Many of the most wealthy and prominent Huguenots had gathered in largely Catholic Paris to attend the wedding.\n\nThe massacre began in the night of 23–24 August 1572 (the eve of the feast of Bartholomew the Apostle), two days after the attempted assassination of Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the military and political leader of the Huguenots. The king ordered the killing of a group of Huguenot leaders, including Coligny, and the slaughter spread throughout Paris. Lasting several weeks, the massacre expanded outward to other urban centres and the countryside. Modern estimates for the number of dead across France vary widely, from 5,000 to 30,000.\n\nThe massacre also marked a turning point in the French Wars of Religion. The Huguenot political movement was crippled by the loss of many of its prominent aristocratic leaders, as well as many re-conversions by the rank and file. Those who remained were increasingly radicalized. Though by no means unique, it \"was the worst of the century's religious massacres\". Throughout Europe, it \"printed on Protestant minds the indelible conviction that Catholicism was a bloody and treacherous religion\".\n\nThe Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day was the culmination of a series of events:\n\nThe Peace of Saint-Germain put an end to three years of terrible civil war between Catholics and Protestants. This peace, however, was precarious since the more intransigent Catholics refused to accept it. The Guise family (strongly Catholic) was out of favour at the French court; the Huguenot leader, Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, was readmitted into the king's council in September 1571. Staunch Catholics were shocked by the return of Protestants to the court, but the queen mother, Catherine de' Medici, and her son, Charles IX, were practical in their support of peace and Coligny, as they were conscious of the kingdom's financial difficulties and the Huguenots' strong defensive position: they controlled the fortified towns of La Rochelle, La Charité-sur-Loire, Cognac, and Montauban.\n\nTo cement the peace between the two religious parties, Catherine planned to marry her daughter Margaret to the Protestant prince, Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV), son of the Huguenot leader Queen Jeanne d'Albret. The royal marriage was arranged for 18 August 1572. It was not accepted by traditionalist Catholics or by the Pope. Both the Pope and King Philip II of Spain strongly condemned Catherine's Huguenot policy as well.\n\nThe impending marriage led to the gathering of a large number of well-born Protestants in Paris, who had come to escort their prince. But Paris was a violently anti-Huguenot city, and Parisians, who tended to be extreme Catholics, found their presence unacceptable. Encouraged by Catholic preachers, they were horrified at the marriage of a princess of France with a Protestant. The Parlement's opposition and the court's absence from the wedding led to increased political tension.\n\nCompounding this bad feeling was the fact that the harvests had been poor and taxes had risen. The rise in food prices and the luxury displayed on the occasion of the royal wedding increased tensions among the common people. A particular point of tension was an open-air cross erected on the site of the house of Philippe de Gastines, a Huguenot who had been executed in 1569. The mob had torn down his house and erected a large wooden cross on a stone base. Under the terms of the peace, and after considerable popular resistance, this had been removed in December 1571 (and re-erected in a cemetery), which had already led to about 50 deaths in riots, as well as mob destruction of property. In the massacres of August, the relatives of the Gastines family were among the first to be killed by the mob.\n\nThe court itself was extremely divided. Catherine had not obtained Pope Gregory XIII's permission to celebrate this irregular marriage; consequently, the French prelates hesitated over which attitude to adopt. It took all the queen mother's skill to convince the Cardinal de Bourbon (paternal uncle of the Protestant groom, but himself a Catholic clergyman) to marry the couple. Beside this, the rivalries between the leading families re-emerged. The Guises were not prepared to make way for their rivals, the House of Montmorency. François, Duke of Montmorency and governor of Paris, was unable to control the disturbances in the city. On August 20, he left the capital and retired to Chantilly.\n\nIn the years preceding the massacre, Huguenot \"political rhetoric\" had for the first time taken a tone against not just the policies of a particular monarch of France, but monarchy in general. In part this was led by an apparent change in stance by John Calvin in his \"Readings on the Prophet Daniel\", a book of 1561, in which he had argued that when kings disobey God, they \"automatically abdicate their worldly power\" – a change from his views in earlier works that even ungodly kings should be obeyed. This change was soon picked up by Huguenot writers, who began to expand on Calvin and promote the idea of the sovereignty of the people, ideas to which Catholic writers and preachers responded fiercely.\n\nNevertheless, it was only in the aftermath of the massacre that anti-monarchical ideas found widespread support from Huguenots, among the \"Monarchomachs\" and others. \"Huguenot writers, who had previously, for the most part, paraded their loyalty to the Crown, now called for the deposition or assassination of a Godless king who had either authorised or permitted the slaughter\". Thus, the massacre \"marked the beginning of a new form of French Protestantism: one that was openly at war with the crown. This was much more than a war against the policies of the crown, as in the first three civil wars; it was a campaign against the very existence of the Gallican monarchy itself\".\n\nTensions were further raised when in May 1572 the news reached Paris that a French Huguenot army under Louis of Nassau had crossed from France to the Netherlandish province of Hainaut and captured the Catholic strongholds of Mons and Valenciennes (now in Belgium and France, respectively). Louis governed the Principality of Orange around Avignon in southern France for his brother William the Silent, who was leading the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish. This intervention threatened to involve France in that war; many Catholics believed that Coligny had again persuaded the king to intervene on the side of the Dutch, as he had managed to do the previous October, before Catherine had got the decision reversed.\n\nAfter the wedding on 18 August 1572, Coligny and the leading Huguenots remained in Paris to discuss some outstanding grievances about the Peace of St. Germain with the king. On 22 August, an attempt was made on Coligny's life as he made his way back to his house from the Louvre. He was shot from an upstairs window, and seriously wounded. The would-be assassin, probably Charles de Louviers, Lord of Maurevert (c. 1505-1583), escaped in the ensuing confusion, and it is still difficult today to decide who was ultimately responsible for the attack. History records three possible candidates:\n\n\nThe attempted assassination of Coligny triggered the crisis that led to the massacre. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed a close relationship with the king, although he was distrusted by the king's mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms. Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny's brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared it might take revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.\n\nThat evening, Catherine held a meeting at the Tuileries Palace with her Italian advisers, including Albert de Gondi, Comte de Retz. On the evening of 23 August, Catherine went to see the king to discuss the crisis. Though no details of the meeting survive, Charles IX and his mother apparently made the decision to eliminate the Protestant leaders. Holt speculated this entailed \"between two and three dozen noblemen\" who were still in Paris. Other historians are reluctant to speculate on the composition or size of the group leaders targeted at this point, beyond the few obvious heads. (Like Coligny, most potential candidates were accompanied by groups of gentlemen as staff and bodyguards; so each killing of a leader could have been expected to involve killing these as well.) \n\nShortly after this decision, the municipal authorities of Paris were summoned. They were ordered to shut the city gates and arm the citizenry to prevent any attempt at a Protestant uprising. The king's Swiss Guard was given the task of killing a list of leading Protestants. It is difficult today to determine the exact chronology of events and to know the moment the killing began. It seems probable that a signal was given by ringing bells for matins (between midnight and dawn) at the church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, near the Louvre, which was the parish church of the kings of France. The Swiss guards expelled the Protestant nobles from the Louvre castle and then slaughtered them in the streets.\nA group led by Guise in person dragged Admiral Coligny from his bed, killed him, and threw his body out of a window. Huguenot nobles in the building first put up a fight, as they were terrified for the life of their leader, but Coligny himself seemed unperturbed. One of Coligny's murderers recognized this calm regarding his fate by stating that \"he never saw anyone less afraid in so great a peril, nor die more steadfastly\" (Dethou). The tension that had been building since the Peace of St. Germain now exploded in a wave of popular violence. The common people began to hunt Protestants throughout the city, including women and children. Chains were used to block streets so that Protestants could not escape from their houses. The bodies of the dead were collected in carts and thrown into the Seine. The massacre in Paris lasted three days despite the king's attempts to stop it. Holt concludes that \"while the general massacre might have been prevented, there is no evidence that it was intended by any of the elites at court\", listing a number of cases where Catholic courtiers intervened to save individual Protestants who were not in the leadership.\n\nThe two leading Huguenot princes, Henry of Navarre and his cousin the Prince of Condé (respectively aged 19 and 20), were spared as they pledged to convert to Catholicism; both renounced their conversions after they escaped Paris. According to some interpretations, the survival of these princes was a key point in Catherine's overall scheme, to prevent the House of Guise from becoming too powerful.\n\nOn August 26, the king and court established the official version of events by going to the Paris Parlement. \"Holding a lit de justice, Charles declared that he had ordered the massacre in order to thwart a Huguenot plot against the royal family.\" A jubilee celebration, including a procession, was then held, while the killings continued in parts of the city.\n\nAlthough Charles had dispatched orders to his provincial governors on August 24 to prevent violence and maintain the terms of the 1570 edict, from August to October, similar massacres of Huguenots took place in a total of twelve other cities: Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lyon, Bourges, Rouen,\nOrléans, Meaux, Angers, La Charité, Saumur, Gaillac and Troyes. In most of them, the killings swiftly followed the arrival of the news of the Paris massacre, but in some places there was a delay of more than a month. According to Mack P. Holt: \"All twelve cities where provincial massacres occurred had one striking feature in common; they were all cities with Catholic majorities where there had once been \"significant\" Protestant minorities... All of them had also experienced serious religious division... during the first three civil wars... Moreover seven of them shared a previous experience ... [they] had actually been taken over by Protestant minorities during the first civil war...\"\nIn several cases the Catholic party in the city believed they had received orders from the king to begin the massacre, some conveyed by visitors to the city, and in other cases apparently coming from a local nobleman or his agent. It seems unlikely any such orders came from the king, although the Guise faction may have desired the massacres. Apparently genuine letters from the Duke of Anjou, the king's younger brother, did urge massacres in the king's name; in Nantes the mayor fortunately held on to his without publicising it until a week later when contrary orders from the king had arrived. In some cities the massacres were led by the mob, while the city authorities tried to suppress them, and in others small groups of soldiers and officials began rounding up Protestants with little mob involvement. In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on September 29 of a Jesuit, Edmond Auger, encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later.\n\nIn the cities affected the loss to the Huguenot communities after the massacres was numerically far larger than those actually killed; in the following weeks there were mass conversions to Catholicism, apparently in response to the threatening atmosphere for Huguenots in these cities. In Rouen, where some hundreds were killed, the Huguenot community shrank from 16,500 to fewer than 3,000 mainly as a result of conversions and emigration to safer cities or countries. Some cities unaffected by the violence nevertheless witnessed a sharp decline in their Huguenot population. It has been claimed that the Huguenot community represented as much as 10% of the French population on the eve of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, declining to 7-8% by the end of the 16th century, and further after heavy persecution began once again during the reign of Louis XIV, culminating with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.\n\nSoon afterward both sides prepared for a fourth civil war, which began before the end of the year.\n\nEstimates of the number that perished in the massacres have varied from 2,000 by a Roman Catholic apologist to 70,000 by the contemporary Huguenot duc de Sully, who himself barely escaped death. Accurate figures for casualties have never been compiled, and, even in writings by modern historians there is a considerable range, though the more specialised the historian, the lower they tend to be. At the low end are figures of about 2,000 in Paris and 3,000 in the provinces, the latter figure an estimate by Philip Benedict in 1978. Other estimates are about 10,000 in total, with about 3,000 in Paris and 7,000 in the provinces. At the higher end are total figures of up to 20,000, or 30,000 in total, from \"a contemporary, non-partisan guesstimate\" quoted by the historians Felipe Fernández-Armesto and D. Wilson. For Paris, the only hard figure is a payment by the city to workmen for collecting and burying 1,100 bodies washed up on the banks of the Seine downstream from the city in one week. Body counts relating to other payments are computed from this.\n\nAmong the slain were the philosopher Petrus Ramus, and in Lyon the composer Claude Goudimel. The corpses floating down the Rhone from Lyons are said to have put the people of Arles off drinking the water for three months.\n\nThe Politiques, those Catholics who placed national unity above sectarian interests, were horrified, but many Catholics inside and outside France initially regarded the massacres as deliverance from an imminent Huguenot coup d'etat. The severed head of Coligny was apparently dispatched to Pope Gregory XIII, though it got no further than Lyon, and the pope sent the king a Golden Rose. The pope ordered a Te Deum to be sung as a special thanksgiving (a practice continued for many years after) and had a medal struck with the motto \"Ugonottorum strages 1572\" (Latin: \"Overthrow (or slaughter) of the Huguenots 1572\") showing an angel bearing a cross and a sword before which are the felled Protestants.\n\nAlthough these formal acts of rejoicing in Rome were not repudiated publicly, misgivings in the papal curia grew as the true nature of the killings gradually became better known. Pope Gregory XIII himself refused to receive Charles de Maurevert, said to be the killer of Coligny, on the ground that he was a murderer.\n\nOn hearing of the slaughter, Philip II of Spain \"laughed, for almost the only time on record\". In Paris, the poet Jean-Antoine de Baïf, founder of the \"Academie de Musique et de Poésie\", wrote a sonnet extravagantly praising the killings. On the other hand, the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian II, King Charles's father-in-law, was sickened, describing the massacre as a \"shameful bloodbath\". Moderate French Catholics also began to wonder whether religious uniformity was worth the price of such bloodshed and the ranks of the Politiques began to swell.\n\nThe massacre caused a \"major international crisis\". Protestant countries were horrified at the events, and only the concentrated efforts of Catherine's ambassadors, including a special mission by Gondi, prevented the collapse of her policy of remaining on good terms with them. Elizabeth I of England's ambassador to France at that time, Sir Francis Walsingham, barely escaped with his life. Even Tsar Ivan the Terrible expressed horror at the carnage in a letter to the Emperor.\n\nThe massacre \"spawned a pullulating mass of polemical literature, bubbling with theories, prejudices and phobias\". Many Catholic authors were exultant in their praise of the king for his bold and decisive action (after regretfully abandoning a policy of meeting Huguenot demands as far as he could) against the supposed Huguenot coup, whose details were now fleshed out in officially sponsored works, though the larger mob massacres were somewhat deprecated: \"[one] must excuse the people's fury moved by a laudable zeal which is difficult to restrain once it has been stirred up\". Huguenot works understandably dwelt on the harrowing details of violence, expounded various conspiracy theories that the royal court had long planned the massacres, and often showed extravagant anti-Italian feelings directed at Catherine, Gondi, and other Italians at court. Diplomatic correspondence was readier than published polemics to recognise the unplanned and chaotic nature of the events, which also emerged from several accounts in memoirs published over the following years by witnesses to the events at court, including two dramatic and influential accounts by members of the royal family that were not recognised as fake until the 19th century, those supposedly by Marguerite of Navarre, and Anjou. Anjou's supposed account was the source of the quotation attributed to Charles IX: \"Well then, so be it! Kill them! But kill them all! Don't leave a single one alive to reproach me!\"\nThe author of the \"Lettre de Pierre Charpentier\" (1572) was not only \"a Protestant of sorts, and thus, apparently, writing with inside knowledge\", but also \"an extreme apologist for the massacre ... in his view ... a well-merited punishment for years of civil disobedience [and] secret sedition...\" A strand of Catholic writing, especially by Italian authors, broke from the official French line to applaud the massacre as precisely a brilliant stratagem, deliberately planned from various points beforehand. The most extreme of these writers was Camilo Capilupi, a papal secretary, whose work insisted that the whole series of events since 1570 had been a masterly plan conceived by Charles IX, and carried through by frequently misleading his mother and ministers as to his true intentions. The Venetian government refused to allow the work to be printed there, and it was eventually published in Rome in 1574, and in the same year quickly reprinted in Geneva in the original Italian and a French translation.\n\nIt was in this context that the massacre came to be seen as a product of Machiavellianism, a view greatly influenced by the Huguenot , who published his \"Discours contre Machievel\" in 1576, which was printed in ten editions in three languages over the next four years. Gentillet held, quite wrongly according to Sydney Anglo, that Machiavelli's \"books [were] held most dear and precious by our Italian and Italionized courtiers\" (in the words of his first English translation), and so (in Anglo's paraphrase) \"at the root of France's present degradation, which has culminated not only in the St Bartholemew massacre but the glee of its perverted admirers\". In fact there is little trace of Machiavelli in French writings before the massacre, and not very much after, until Gentillet's own book, but this concept was seized upon by many contemporaries, and played a crucial part in setting the long-lasting popular concept of Machiavellianism that so infuriates scholars of his actual thought. It also gave added impetus to the strong anti-Italian feelings already present in Huguenot polemic.\n\nChristopher Marlowe was one of many Elizabethan writers who were enthusiastic proponents of these ideas. In the \"Jew of Malta\" (1589–90) \"Machievel\" in person speaks the Prologue, claiming to not be dead, but to have possessed the soul of (the Duke of) Guise, \"And, now the Guise is dead, is come from France/ To view this land, and frolic with his friends\" (Prologue, lines 3-4) His last play, \"The Massacre at Paris\" (1593) takes the massacre, and the following years, as its subject, with Guise and Catherine both depicted as Machiavellian plotters, bent on evil from the start. The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 was still ready to endorse a version of this view, describing the massacres as \"an entirely political act committed in the name of the immoral principles of Machiavellianism\" and blaming \"the pagan theories of a certain raison d'état according to which the end justified the means\".\n\nThe French 18th-century historian Louis-Pierre Anquetil, in his \"Esprit de la Ligue\" of 1767, was among the first to begin impartial historical investigation, emphasizing the lack of premeditation (before the attempt on Coligny) in the massacre and that Catholic mob violence had a history of uncontrollable escalation. By this period the Massacre was being widely used by Voltaire (in his \"Henriade\") and other Enlightenment writers in polemics against organized religion in general. The question of whether the massacre had long been premeditated was not entirely settled until the late 19th century; Lord Acton changed his mind on the matter twice, finally concluding that it was not.\n\nOver the centuries, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre has inevitably aroused a great deal of controversy. Modern historians are still divided over the responsibility of the royal family:\n\n\n\nTraditional histories have tended to focus more on the roles of the political notables whose machinations began the massacre than the mindset of those who actually did the killing. Ordinary lay Catholics were involved in the mass killings; they believed they were executing the wishes of the king and of God. At this time, in an age before mass media, \"the pulpit remained probably the most effective means of mass communication\".\n\nDespite the large numbers of pamphlets and broadsheets in circulation, literacy rates were still poor. Thus, some modern historians have stressed the critical and incendiary role that militant preachers played in shaping ordinary lay beliefs, both Catholic and Protestant.\n\nHistorian Barbara B. Diefendorf, Professor of History at Boston University, wrote that Simon Vigor had \"said if the King ordered the Admiral (Coligny) killed, 'it would be wicked not to kill him'. With these words, the most popular preacher in Paris legitimised in advance the events of St. Bartholomew's Day\". Diefendorf says that when the head of the murdered Coligny was shown to the Paris mob by a member of the nobility, with the claim that it was the King's will, the die was cast. Another historian Mack P. Holt, Professor at George Mason University, agrees that Vigor, \"the best known preacher in Paris,\" preached sermons that were full of references to the evils that would befall the capital should the Protestants seize control. This view is also partly supported by Cunningham and Grell (2000) who explained that \"militant sermons by priests such as Simon Vigor served to raise the religious and eschatological temperature on the eve of the Massacre\".\n\nHistorians cite the extreme tension and bitterness that led to the powder-keg atmosphere of Paris in August 1572. In the previous ten years there had already been three outbreaks of civil war, and attempts by Protestant nobles to seize power in France. Some blame the complete esteem with which the sovereign's office was held, justified by prominent French Roman Catholic theologians, and that the special powers of French Kings \"...were accompanied by explicit responsibilities, the foremost of which was combating heresy.\"\n\nHolt, notable for re-emphasising the importance of religious issues, as opposed to political/dynastic power struggles or socio-economic tensions, in explaining the French Wars of Religion, also re-emphasised the role of religion in the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre. He noted that the extra violence inflicted on many of the corpses \"was not random at all, but patterned after the rites of the Catholic culture that had given birth to it.\" \"Many Protestant houses were burned, invoking the traditional purification by fire of all heretics. Many victims were also thrown into the Seine, invoking the purification by water of Catholic baptism\". Viewed as a threat to the social and political order, Holt argues that \"Huguenots not only had to be exterminated – that is, killed – they also had to be humiliated, dishonoured, and shamed as the inhuman beasts they were perceived to be.\"\n\nHowever Raymond Mentzer points out that Protestants \"could be as bloodthirsty as Catholics. Earlier Huguenot rage at Nimes (in 1567) led to... the massacre of a hundred or so Catholics, mostly priests and prominent laymen, at the hands of their Protestant neighbours. Few towns escaped the episodic violence and some suffered repeatedly from both sides. Neither faith had a monopoly on cruelty and misguided fervour\".\n\nSome, like Leonie Frieda, emphasise the element within the mob violence of the \"haves\" being \"killed by the 'have-nots'\". Many Protestants were nobles or bourgeois and Frieda adds that \"a number of bourgeois Catholic Parisians had suffered the same fate as the Protestants; many financial debts were wiped clean with the death of creditors and moneylenders that night\". At least one Huguenot was able to buy off his would-be murderers.\n\nThe historian H.G. Koenigsberger (who until his retirement in 1984 was Professor of History at King's College, University of London) wrote that the Massacre was deeply disturbing because \"it was Christians massacring other Christians who were not foreign enemies but their neighbours with which they and their forebears had lived in a Christian community, and under the same ruler, for a thousand years\". He concludes that the historical importance of the Massacre \"lies not so much in the appalling tragedies involved as their demonstration of the power of sectarian passion to break down the barriers of civilisation, community and accepted morality\".\n\nAn explanation of this may lie in the analysis of the massacre in terms of social anthropology by the religious historian Bruce Lincoln, who describes how the religious divide, which gave the Huguenots different patterns of dress, eating and pastimes, as well as the obvious differences of religion and (very often) class, had become a social schism or cleavage. The rituals around the royal marriage had only intensified this cleavage, contrary to its intentions, and the \"sentiments of estrangement – radical otherness – [had come] to prevail over sentiments of affinity between Catholics and Protestants\".\n\nOn 23 August 1997, Pope John Paul II, who was in Paris for the 12th World Youth Day, issued a statement on the Massacre. He stayed in Paris for three days and made eleven speeches. According to Reuters and the Associated Press, at a late-night vigil, with the hundreds of thousands of young people who were in Paris for the celebrations, he made the following comments: \"On the eve of Aug. 24, we cannot forget the sad massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, an event of very obscure causes in the political and religious history of France. ... Christians did things which the Gospel condemns. I am convinced that only forgiveness, offered and received, leads little by little to a fruitful dialogue, which will in turn ensure a fully Christian reconciliation. ... Belonging to different religious traditions must not constitute today a source of opposition and tension. On the contrary, our common love for Christ impels us to seek tirelessly the path of full unity.\"\n\nThe Elizabethan dramatist Christopher Marlowe knew the story well from the Huguenot literature translated into English, and probably from French refugees who had sought refuge in his native Canterbury. He wrote a strongly anti-Catholic and anti-French play based on the events entitled 'The Massacre at Paris'. Also, in his biography \"The World of Christopher Marlowe\", David Riggs claims the incident remained with the playwright, and massacres are incorporated into the final acts of three of his early plays, \"1\" and \"2 Tamburlaine\" and \"The Jew of Malta\" – see above for Marlowe and Machiavellism.\n\nThe story was also taken up in 1772 by Louis-Sébastien Mercier in his play \"Jean Hennuyer, Bishop of Lizieux\", unperformed until the French Revolution. This play was translated into English, with some adaptations, as \"The Massacre\" by the actress and playwright Elizabeth Inchbald in 1792. Inchbald kept the historical setting, but \"The Massacre\", completed by February 1792, also reflected events in the recent French Revolution, though not the September Massacres of 1792, which coincided with its printing.\n\nJoseph Chénier's play \"Charles IX\" was a huge success during the French Revolution, drawing strongly anti-monarchical and anti-religious lessons from the massacre. Chénier was able to put his principles into practice as a politician, voting for the execution of Louis XVI and many others, perhaps including his brother André Chénier. However, before the collapse of the Revolution he became suspected of moderation, and in some danger himself.\nThe story was fictionalised by Prosper Mérimée in his \"Chronique du règne de Charles IX\" (1829), and by Alexandre Dumas, père in \"La Reine Margot\", an 1845 novel that fills in the history as it was then seen with romance and adventure. That novel has been translated into English and was made first into a commercially successful French film in 1954, \"La reine Margot\" (US title \"A Woman of Evil\"), starring Jeanne Moreau. It was remade in 1994 as \"La Reine Margot\" (later as \"Queen Margot\", and subtitled, in English-language markets), starring Isabelle Adjani.\n\nGiacomo Meyerbeer's opera \"Les Huguenots\" (1836), very loosely based on the events of the massacre, was one of the most popular and spectacular examples of French grand opera.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais managed to create a sentimental moment in the massacre in his painting \"A Huguenot on St. Bartholomew's Day\" (1852), which depicts a Catholic woman attempting to convince her Huguenot lover to wear the white scarf badge of the Catholics and protect himself. The man, true to his beliefs, gently refuses her. Millais was inspired to create the painting after seeing Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\".\n\nMark Twain described the massacre in \"From the Manuscript of 'A Tramp Abroad' (1879): The French and the Comanches,\" an essay about \"partly civilized races.\" He wrote in part, \"St. Bartholomew's was unquestionably the finest thing of the kind ever devised and accomplished in the world. All the best people took a hand in it, the King and the Queen Mother included.\"\n\nThe St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre and the events surrounding it were incorporated into D.W. Griffith's film \"Intolerance\" (1916). The film follows Catherine de' Medici (Josephine Crowell) plotting the massacre, coercing her son King Charles IX (Frank Bennett) to sanction it. Incidental characters include Henri of Navarre, Marguerite de Valois (Constance Talmadge), Admiral Coligny (Joseph Henabery) and the Duke of Anjou, who is portrayed as homosexual. These historic scenes are depicted alongside a fictional plot in which a Huguenot family is caught among the events.\n\nAnother novel depicting this massacre is \"Queen Jezebel\", by Jean Plaidy (1953). In the third episode of the BBC miniseries \"Elizabeth R\" (1971), starring Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I of England, the English court's reaction to the massacre and its effect on England's relations with France is addressed in depth.\n\nA 1966 serial in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" entitled \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" is set during the events leading up to the Paris massacre. Leonard Sachs appeared as Admiral Coligny and Joan Young played Catherine de Medici. This serial is missing from the BBC archives and survives only in audio form.\n\nThe St Bartholomew's Day Massacre is the setting for Tim Willocks' historical novel, \"The Twelve Children of Paris\" (Matthias Tannhauser Trilogy:2) (2013), and Ken Follett's book A Column of Fire, published in 2017. Follett gives several of the book's main characters a role in the massacre and the events leading up to it.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Turkey's General Directorate for Press, Broadcasting, and Information also revoked at least 620 journalists' accreditations.\n\nAs a result of the crackdown, 2,308 media workers and journalists have lost their job. Turkey's media purge has also occurred online: regulators blocked at least 30 news-related websites. Websites not linked to Gülen's movement, such as Wikileaks and the Turkish satirical weekly \"Leman\", are among those blocked inside Turkey. In addition 48 online news stories from outlets including \"The Independent\" have been censored. Three stories were about corruptions allegations involving the president's son Bilal Erdogan. Wikipedia is also blocked in the country since April 2017.\n\nOn Thursday July 21, six days after the failed coup d’état, Turkey’s parliament approved a bill declaring a state of emergency allowing the government to rule by decree for three months. On the same day, Erdogan announced that the European Convention on Human Rights had been suspended.\n\nUnder the Turkish constitution, during a state of emergency, the government can overturn the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, as long as it respects international laws. However, the 15th article of the Turkish Constitution states that the ECHR cannot be suspended.\n\nIn this context and that of a a wider purge in Turkey with 40,000 arrests and 160,000 suspensions of officials, President Erdogan initiated a purge of media and journalists suspected of sympathy with the Gülen movement. On July 27th, Erdogan published a decree in Turkey's official government gazette, ordering the shutdown of three news agencies, 16 TV channels, 23 radio channels, 45 newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses (see list below).\n\nBy the force of the state of emergency, \"all goods, assets, rights, documents and papers [belonging to those media outlets] will be transferred, free of charge, to Turkish treasury with no appeal to be made\". Also, 89 arrest warrants were issued for journalists who were alleged plotters in the failed attempt to overthrow the government.\n\nDuring the same week, 17 journalists were charged with membership in Gülen’s movement, which the government considers a terrorist group. On August 5, this number increased to 36 journalists indicted for the same charge. The Turkish government justified the arrests for security reasons and said the journalists were being investigated and prosecuted for participating in criminal activities. On August 27, the Platform for Independent Journalism (P24), a press freedom group, said the number of journalists arrested since the coup was 108.\n\nPress freedom groups have condemned the crackdown. The Turkish representative for Reporters Without Borders called the arrests \"a witch hunt against journalists\". David Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression said that \"the attempted coup cannot justify such a broad attack against almost all voices, not just critical ones but analytic and journalistic.\"\n\n\"The disregard for any assurance of due process is flagrant and only contributes to the extreme levels of insecurity affecting all those working to inform people of the ongoing crisis in the country,\" said Dunja Mijatović, the media freedom representative of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s representative on media freedom.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalist’s program coordinator for central Asia, Nina Ognianova, said that the \"scale of this rout of the media is staggering.\" She added: \"The government is exploiting a failed coup to silence the critical press when Turkey most needs pluralistic media.\"\n\nThe Turkey director at Human Rights Watch, Emma Sinclair-Webb, added to the criticism \"In the absence of any evidence of their role or participation in the violent attempt to overthrow the government, we strongly condemn this accelerated assault on the media, which further undermines Turkey’s democratic credentials\", she said.\n\n\nSource:\n\nNews Agencies\nTV Channels\nRadio Stations \nNewspapers (local) \nNewspapers (national) \nMagazines \nPublishing Houses and Distribution Companies\n\n\n"}

The winning team is usually determined by aggregate score, the sum of the scores of the two legs. For example, if the scores of the two legs are:\nThen the aggregate score will be Team A 5–3 Team B, meaning team A wins the tie. In some competitions, a tie is considered to be drawn if each team wins one leg, regardless of the aggregate score. Two-legged ties can be used in knockout cup competitions and playoffs.\n\nIn North America, the equivalent term is home-and-home series or, if decided by aggregate, two-game total-goals series.\n\nIn football, two-legged ties are used in the later stages of many international club tournaments, including the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores; in many domestic cup competitions, including the Coppa Italia and the Copa del Rey; in domestic league play-offs, including the Football League play-offs and the MLS Cup Playoffs; and in national-team playoffs in some qualification tournaments, including FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nIn ice hockey, the National Hockey League used two-game, total-goals series in the early years of its playoffs. It applied to all its playoffs from 1918 to 1926, and the early rounds until 1937, when it completed the switch to best-of-\"n\" series. The NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship also used a two-game total goals format for much of its history.\n\nIn rugby union, two-legged matches are used in the qualifying stages of the Rugby World Cup. The semifinals of the Italian National Championship of Excellence are also two-legged, as are the semifinals and final of England's second-tier league, the RFU Championship.\n\nIn basketball, the two top European club competitions, the Euroleague and Eurocup, both use two-legged ties in the qualifying rounds that determine the clubs advancing to each competition's group phase. The Eurocup also uses two-legged ties in its quarterfinal round, which will be a separate phase of the competition starting in 2009–10. The French Pro A league used two-legged ties in all of its playoff rounds, except for the one-off final, until the 2006–07 season. At that time, all of its playoff rounds leading up to the final, which remained a single match through 2011–12, were changed to best-of-three series. The final changed to best-of-five starting in 2012–13.\n\nIn Gaelic football, two-legged finals were used for five seasons of the National Football League, the last in 1988–89. The International Rules Series was also two-legged in 1998–2013 and from 2017 onward.\n\nIn Canadian football, two-legged total point series were occasionally used by the Canadian Football League and their predecessor leagues in the postseason, most recently in the 1986 playoffs.\n\nIn Arena football, the playoff semifinals (but not the Arena Bowl itself) were decided, at least for the 2018 season, by a two-legged total points playoff. In one semifinal, the first game ended in a tie, and went to overtime. However, the winner of the second game won by a larger margin (within regulation time) and was awarded overall victory based on total aggregate points.\n\nIf the aggregate score is tied after the two legs, various methods can be used to break ties. Under the away goals rule, the team who scored more away goals advances. If away goals are equal, or are not considered, then the tie may be decided by extra time and/or penalty shootout. Replays, at the second-leg venue or a neutral venue, were formerly used in European club competitions. In the \"Liguilla\" (playoffs) of the Primera División de México, the team with the better regular-season record advances; some leagues take the two teams' record against one another into account. In the promotion playoffs in Italy's Serie B (which do not necessarily occur in a given season), two-legged ties that are level on aggregate at the end of regulation time of the second leg go to extra time (away goals are not used); if the tie remains level after extra time, the team that finished higher on the league table advances.\n\nEach team hosts one match, and there is no intended advantage to whether a team plays at home first or second. However, lots of managers and players believe that the team playing at home for the second leg has a slight advantage. The thinking is that the team playing away for the first leg can play it safe there (a draw or even a slight defeat is considered a favourable result), and then \"win\" the tie at home in the second leg.\n\nA statistical analysis of roughly 12,000 matches from the European club competitions between 1956 and 2007 showed that around 53% of teams playing at home in the second leg won the tie (even after allowing for the fact that team playing at home in the second leg tend to be better teams). This effect has however decreased over time.\n\nIn the case of World Cup intercontinental playoffs the team that plays the second leg at home has won 61% of ties.\n\nIn knockout competitions, alternatives to two-legged ties include: \n"}
{"id": "154989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154989", "title": "Walden Two", "text": "Walden Two\n\nWalden Two is a utopian novel written by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, first published in 1948. In its time, it could have been considered science fiction, since science-based methods for altering people's behavior did not yet exist. Such methods are now known as applied behavior analysis.\n\n\"Walden Two\" is controversial because its characters speak of a rejection of free will, including a rejection of the proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a spirit or a soul. \"Walden Two\" embraces the proposition that the behavior of organisms, including humans, is determined by environmental variables, and that systematically altering environmental variables can generate a sociocultural system that very closely approximates utopia.\n\nThe first-person narrator and protagonist, Professor Burris, is a university instructor of psychology, who is approached by two young men (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of World War II and, intrigued by utopianism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an intentional community that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends and Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.\n\nThe rest of the book proceeds largely as a novel of ideas, mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics such as behavioral modification, political ethics, educational philosophy, sexual equality (specifically, advocacy for women in the workforce), the common good, historiography, freedom and free will, the dilemma of determinism, fascism, American democracy, and Soviet communism are discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.\n\nIn effect, Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually testing the most successful, evidence-based strategies in order to organize the community. Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. He verifies Walden Two's success by pointing to its members' overall sense of happiness and freedom—thanks in part to a program of \"behavioral engineering\" begun at birth. Despite these behavior-guiding procedures during childhood, the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, and happy people; they also appear to govern the course of their own lives.\n\nFrazier delightedly explains that Walden Two's decision-making system is not authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic. Except for a small fluctuating group of community organizers, called Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body; certainly, the Planners have no power to exercise violent force on the community, a feature that Frazier often praises. Each member of the community is apparently self-motivated, with an amazingly relaxed work schedule of only four average hours of work a day, directly supporting the common good and accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. The members then use the large remainder of their time to engage in creative or recreational activities of their own choosing. The only money is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable labor. Members automatically receive ample food and sleep, with higher needs met by nurturing one's artistic, intellectual, and athletic interests, ranging from music to literature and from chess to tennis. \n\nAs Burris and the other visitors tour the grounds, they discover that certain radically unusual customs have been established in Walden Two, quite bizarre to the American mainstream, but showing apparent success in the long run. Some of these customs include that children are raised communally, families are non-nuclear, free affection is the norm, and personal expressions of thanks are taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community's individually self-enforced \"Walden Code\", a guideline for self-control techniques, which encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community, while requiring minimal strain. Community counselors are also available to supervise behavior and assist members with better understanding and following the Code.\n\nExcitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of despotism, though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the \"despotism of democracy\". \n\nAt some points, Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up, the most recent being Walden Six. Although enticed by Walden Two's obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier's irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. During one conversation, Frazier admits to being boastful, but argues that his personality should not influence Burris's opinion of Walden Two and his own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent. \n\nDuring the visitors' trip back to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.\n\nThe novel describes \"an experimental community called Walden Two\". The community is located in a rural area and \"has nearly a thousand members\". The community encourages its members \"to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement\" and to have \"a constantly experimental attitude toward everything\". The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the simple living and self-sufficiency that Henry David Thoreau practiced (on an individual scale) at Walden Pond, as described in his 1854 book \"Walden\". Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the nuclear family through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child's parents or immediate family.\n\nWalden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict economic classes): \"Planners\", \"Managers\", \"Workers\", and \"Scientists\". Walden Two has a constitution that provides for a “\"Board of Planners\"”, which is Walden Two’s “only government”, though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The “Board of Planners” was conceived of while Walden Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are “six Planners, usually three men and three women”, who are “charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.” A Planner “may serve for ten years, but no longer.” A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board \"from a pair of names supplied by the Managers\". Furthermore, the Walden Two constitution “can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers”.\n\nFrazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris’s visit to Walden Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a cult of personality, system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners' identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden Two’s egalitarian cultural structure.\n\nManagers, meanwhile, are “specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden Two”. A member of the community can “work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship”. The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process. The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.\n\nThe regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden Two operates using a simple point system of units called “credits”, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.\n\nThe final grouping within Walden Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments “in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two’s] raw materials”. Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.\n\n\"Walden Two\"'s title is a direct reference to Henry David Thoreau’s book \"Walden\". In the novel, the Walden Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau’s Walden, but “with company”. It is, as the book says, ‘Walden for two’ – meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it \"The Sun is but a Morning Star\", a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau’s \"Walden\", but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.\n\nIn theory and in practice, Thoreau’s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden Two experiment were far different from one another: For instance, Thoreau’s book \"Walden\" espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while \"Walden Two\" espouses\n\nThe cover of \"Walden Two\", shown above, includes an ‘O’ filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the ‘O’. That Sun-like ‘O’ is an allusion to the proposition that \"The sun is but a morning star\".\n\nSkinner published a follow-up to \"Walden Two\" in an essay titled \"News From Nowhere, 1984\". It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as George Orwell. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two's \"lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system\", a state of affairs that embodied \"the dream of nineteenth-century anarchism\".\n\nMany efforts to create a Walden Two in real life are detailed in Hilke Kuhlmann's \"Living Walden Two\" and in Daniel W. Bjork's \"B.F. Skinner\".\n\nSome of these efforts include:\n\n\nTwin Oaks is detailed in Kat Kinkade's book, \"A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community\". Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.\n\nLos Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in \"Walden Two.\" They refer to their governance system as a \"personocracy\". This system has been \"developed through ongoing experimentation\". In contrast to Twin Oaks, Los Horcones \"has remained strongly committed to an experimental science of human behavior and has described itself as the only true Walden Two community in existence.\" In 1989, B. F. Skinner said that Los Horcones \"comes closest to the idea of the 'engineered utopia' that he put forth in \"Walden Two\"\".\n\nSkinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both \"Science and Human Behavior\" and \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity\". In \"Science and Human Behavior\" a chapter is titled \"Designing a Culture\" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity\" there are many indirect references to \"Walden Two\" when describing other cultural designs.\n\nHilke Kuhlmann's \"Living Walden Two\" possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original \"Walden Two\" which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.\n\nIn a critique of \"Walden Two,\" Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner's \"fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment\", and that Skinner's goal \"is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit\", and to thus \"make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient anthill\". Gamble writes, \"We find at the end of \"Walden Two\" that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda.\" However, contrary to Gamble's critique, it should be noted that neither Frazier nor any other person has the \"sole\" power to amend the constitution of Walden Two. See the \"Community governance\" section, above.\n\nThere are several varieties of behaviorism but only Skinner’s radical behaviorism, has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in a best-seller \"Beyond Freedom and Dignity\" (1971).\n\n\"Walden Two\" was criticized in John Staddon's \"The New Behaviorism\". Skinner thought \"Walden Two\" an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: Aldous Huxley’s \"Brave New World\" (1931) and George Orwell’s \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949). He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard. There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias. They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\") or stealthy (\"Brave New World\") efforts to control or gentle human beings. On the contrary, \"Walden Two\" is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.\n\nSkinner’s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato’s philosopher king: a ‘legislator’ (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people. The guardians “are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,” wrote Bertrand Russell, one of Skinner’s heroes, in 1946. Not too different from Walden Two’s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner’s avatar and leader of the community. Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: “We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.”\n\n\n\n\n"}
