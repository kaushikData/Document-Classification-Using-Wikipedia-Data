An active transformation is a transformation which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or rigid body, which can be defined in the absence of a coordinate system; whereas a passive transformation is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or change of basis). By \"transformation\", mathematicians usually refer to active transformations, while physicists and engineers could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a translation and a linear transformation.\n\nPut differently, a \"passive\" transformation refers to description of the \"same\" object in two different coordinate systems.\nOn the other hand, an \"active transformation\" is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system. For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the tibia relative to the femur, that is, its motion relative to a (\"local\") coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (\"global\") coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.\n\nAs an example, let the vector formula_2, be a vector in the plane. A rotation of the vector through an angle θ in counterclockwise direction is given by the rotation matrix:\nwhich can be viewed either as an \"active transformation\" or a \"passive transformation\" (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.\n\nIn general a spatial transformation formula_5 may consist of a translation and a linear transformation.

Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.\n\nOn the other hand, when one views formula_6 as a passive transformation, the initial vector formula_8 is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, i.e. with the inverse transformation formula_15.\n\nThe new coordinates formula_17 of formula_18 with respect to the new coordinate system XYZ are given by: \n\nFrom this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by\n\nAs a passive transformation formula_6 transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.\n\nNote the difference between formula_17 and formula_23\n\n\n"}
{"id": "644646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=644646", "title": "Alexithymia", "text": "Alexithymia\n\nAlexithymia is a personality construct characterized by the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating. Furthermore, people with alexithymia have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding. Alexithymia occurs in approximately 10% of the population and can occur with a number of psychiatric conditions.\n\nThe term \"alexithymia\" was coined by psychotherapists John Case Nemiah and Peter Sifneos in 1973. The word comes from Greek: (, 'not') + (, 'words') + (, 'heart' or 'emotions'), literally meaning \"no words for emotions\".\n\nNonmedical terms describing similar conditions include emotionless and impassive. People with the condition are called alexithymics or alexithymiacs.\n\nAlexithymia is considered to be a personality trait that places affected individuals at risk for other medical and psychiatric disorders while reducing the likelihood that these individuals will respond to conventional treatments for the other conditions. Alexithymia is not classified as a mental disorder in the fourth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\". It is a dimensional personality trait that varies in severity from person to person. A person's alexithymia score can be measured with questionnaires such as the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ), the Online Alexithymia Questionnaire (OAQ-G2) or the Observer Alexithymia Scale (OAS). It is distinct from the psychiatric personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, with which it shares some characteristics, and is likewise distinct from the abnormal conditions of sociopathy or psychopathy.\n\nAlexithymia is defined by:\n\nIn studies of the general population the degree of alexithymia was found to be influenced by age, but not by gender; the rates of alexithymia in healthy controls have been found at: 8.3%; 4.7%; 8.9%; and 7%. Thus, several studies have reported that the prevalence rate of alexithymia is less than 10%. A less common finding suggests that there may be a higher prevalence of alexithymia amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with \"describing feelings\", but not by difficulties in \"identifying feelings\" in which males and females show similar abilities. \nPsychologist R. Michael Bagby and psychiatrist Graeme J. Taylor have argued that the alexithymia construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of psychological mindedness and emotional intelligence and there is \"strong empirical support for alexithymia being a stable personality trait rather than just a consequence of psychological distress\". Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be state-dependent.\n\nBagby and Taylor also suggest that there may be two kinds of alexithymia, \"primary alexithymia\" which is an enduring psychological trait that does not alter over time, and \"secondary alexithymia\" which is state-dependent and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of alexithymia are otherwise called \"trait\" or \"state\" alexithymia.\n\nTypical deficiencies may include problems identifying, processing, describing, and working with one's own feelings, often marked by a lack of understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have alexithymia also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes alexithymia.\n\nSome alexithymic individuals may appear to contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic dysphoria or manifest outbursts of crying or rage. However, questioning usually reveals that they are quite incapable of describing their feelings or appear confused by questions inquiring about specifics of feelings.\n\nAccording to Henry Krystal, individuals suffering from alexithymia think in an operative way and may appear to be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.\n\nA common misconception about alexithymia is that affected individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally and that they may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as \"happy\" or \"unhappy\" when describing these feelings. The core issue is that people with alexithymia have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others. This contributes to the sense of emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making alexithymia negatively associated with life satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.\n\nIt is unclear what causes alexithymia, though several theories have been proposed.\n\nEarly studies showed evidence that there may be an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased corpus callosum, often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse. A neuropsychological study in 1997 indicated that alexithymia may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the brain, which is largely responsible for processing emotions. In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that alexithymia may be related to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex. These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind alexithymia remains inconclusive.\n\nFrench psychoanalyst Joyce McDougall objected to the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological at the expense of psychological explanations for the genesis and operation of alexithymia, and introduced the alternative term \"disaffectation\" to stand for psychogenic alexithymia. For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point \"experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity\", to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness. A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of phenomenology. McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word \"infans\" is from the Latin \"not speaking\"), and are \"by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic\". Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be \"an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure\". The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The parent's emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child's facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent's ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child's capacity to understand emotional expressions.\n\nMolecular genetic research into alexithymia remains minimal, but promising candidates have been identified from studies examining connections between certain genes and alexithymia among those with psychiatric conditions as well as the general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of alexithymia among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining alexithymia in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder found higher alexithymia levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with alexithymia.\n\nAlthough there is evidence for the role of environmental and neurological factors, the role and influence of genetic factors for developing alexithymia is still unclear. A single large scale Danish study suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of alexithymia. However, such twin studies are controversial, as they suffer from the \"equal environments assumption\" and the \"heritability\" estimates in no way correspond to actual DNA structures. \nTraumatic brain injury is also implicated in the development alexithymia, and those with traumatic brain injury are six times more likely to exhibit alexithymia.\n\nAlexithymia creates interpersonal problems because these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, or if they do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, \"such that the relationship remains superficial\". Inadequate \"differentiation\" between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.\n\nIn a study, a large group of alexithymic individuals completed the 64-item Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-64) which found that \"two interpersonal problems are significantly and stably related to alexithymia: cold/distant and non-assertive social functioning. All other IIP-64 subscales were not significantly related to alexithymia.\"\n\nChaotic interpersonal relations have also been observed by Sifneos. Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, alexithymia also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.\n\nIn a 2008 study alexithymia was found to be correlated with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality. Individuals high on the alexithymia spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.\n\nSome individuals working for organizations in which control of emotions is the norm might show alexithymic-like behavior but not be alexithymic. However, over time the lack of self-expressions can become routine and they may find it harder to identify with others.\n\nAlexithymia frequently co-occurs with other disorders. Research indicates that alexithymia overlaps with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In a 2004 study using the TAS-20, 85% of the adults with ASD fell into the impaired category; almost half of the whole group fell into the severely impaired category. Among the adult control, only 17% was impaired; none of them severely. Fitzgerald & Bellgrove pointed out that, \"Like alexithymia, Asperger's syndrome is also characterised by core disturbances in speech and language and social relationships\". Hill & Berthoz agreed with Fitzgerald & Bellgrove (2006) and in response stated that \"there is some form of overlap between alexithymia and ASDs\". They also pointed to studies that revealed impaired theory of mind skill in alexithymia, neuroanatomical evidence pointing to a shared etiology and similar social skills deficits. The exact nature of the overlap is uncertain. Alexithymic traits in AS may be linked to clinical depression or anxiety; the mediating factors are unknown and it is possible that alexithymia predisposes to anxiety.\n\nThere are many more psychiatric disorders that overlap with alexithymia. One study found that 41% of Vietnam War veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were alexithymic. Another study found higher levels of alexithymia among Holocaust survivors with PTSD compared to those without. Higher levels of alexithymia among mothers with interpersonal violence-related PTSD were found in one study to have proportionally less caregiving sensitivity. This latter study suggested that when treating adult PTSD patients who are parents, alexithymia should be assessed and addressed also with attention to the parent-child relationship and the child's social-emotional development.\n\nSingle study prevalence findings for other disorders include 63% in anorexia nervosa, 56% in bulimia, 45% to 50% in major depressive disorder, 34% in panic disorder, 28% of social phobics, and 50% in substance abusers. Alexithymia is also exhibited by a large proportion of individuals with acquired brain injuries such as stroke or traumatic brain injury.\n\nAlexithymia is correlated with certain personality disorders, substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and sexual disorders, as well as certain physical illnesses, such as hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional dyspepsia. Alexithymia is further linked with disorders such as migraine headaches, lower back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, nausea, allergies, and fibromyalgia.\n\nAn inability to modulate emotions is a possibility in explaining why some people with alexithymia are prone to discharge tension arising from unpleasant emotional states through impulsive acts or compulsive behaviors such as binge eating, substance abuse, perverse sexual behavior, or anorexia nervosa. The failure to regulate emotions cognitively might result in prolonged elevations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and neuroendocrine systems which can lead to somatic diseases. People with alexithymia also show a limited ability to experience positive emotions leading Krystal (1988) and Sifneos (1987) to describe many of these individuals as anhedonic.\n\n\n\n"}

Specifically, \"algorithmic transparency\" states that the inputs to the algorithm and the algorithm's use itself must be known, but they need not be fair. \"Algorithmic accountability\" implies that the organizations that use algorithms must be accountable for the decisions made by those algorithms, even though the decisions are being made by a machine, and not by a human being.\n\nCurrent research around algorithmic transparency interested in both societal effects of accessing remote services running algorithms., as well as mathematical and computer science approaches that can be used to achieve algorithmic transparency In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection studies how algorithms are used by consumers by conducting its own research on algorithmic transparency and by funding external research.

{"id": "3007244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3007244", "title": "Aufheben", "text": "Aufheben\n\nAufheben or Aufhebung is a German word with several seemingly contradictory meanings, including \"to lift up\", \"to abolish\", \"cancel\" or \"suspend\", or \"to sublate\". The term has also been defined as \"abolish\", \"preserve\", and \"transcend\". In philosophy, \"aufheben\" is used by Hegel to explain what happens when a thesis and antithesis interact, and in this sense is translated mainly as \"sublate\".\n\nIn Hegel, the term \"Aufhebung\" has the apparently contradictory implications of both preserving and changing, and eventually advancement (the German verb \"aufheben\" means \"to cancel\", \"to keep\" and \"to pick up\"). The tension between these senses suits what Hegel is trying to talk about. In sublation, a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept. Sublation is the motor by which the dialectic functions.\n\nSublation can be seen at work at the most basic level of Hegel's system of logic. The two concepts \"Being\" and \"Nothing\" are each both preserved and changed through sublation in the concept \"Becoming\". Similarly, \"determinateness\", or \"quality\", and \"magnitude\", or \"quantity\", are each both preserved and sublated in the concept \"measure\".\n\nHegel's philosophy of history stresses the importance of negative (the antithesis) in history—negative includes wars, etc., but not only. His conception of historical progress follows a dialectic spiral, in which the thesis is opposed by the antithesis, itself sublated by the synthesis. Hegel stated that Aufheben is uniquely exempt from the historical process in that it is supposed to be true for all time and never changes or develops further as in \"das absolute Wissen\" (\"absolute knowledge\"). The synthesis both abolishes and preserves the thesis and the antithesis, an apparent contradiction which leads to difficulties in interpreting this concept (and to translate \"Aufheben\"). In Hegel's logic, self-contradiction is legitimate and necessary.\n\nFor Hegel, history (like logic) proceeds in every small way through sublation. For example, the Oriental, Greek and Roman Empires (in which the individual is ignored or annihilated, then recognized, and finally suppressed by the States) are preserved \"and\" destroyed in the First French Empire, which, for Hegel, placed the individual in harmony with the State.\n\nAt the level of social history, sublation can be seen at work in the master-slave dialectic.\n\nHegel approached the history of philosophy in the same way, arguing that important philosophical ideas of the past are not rejected but rather preserved and changed as philosophy develops.\n\nIn Hegel's view, one can always find another thing in reflective philosophy upon which some \"absolute\" ground relies. With Fichte's ultimate ground, the \"I\" or \"ego\", for example, one can immediately see the reliance upon the \"non-I\", which allows Fichte to distinguish what he means by the \"I\". Reflection is circular, as Fichte unapologetically acknowledged.\n\nFor Hegel, reflective thought is to be avoided due to its circularity. It leads to covering the same problems and ground ever and anon for each philosophical generation. It is a \"philosophia perennis.\"\n\nInstead, Hegel calls on speculative thought: two contradictory elements are held together, uplifted and sublated without completely destroying one another. Speculative thought seeks to avoid the idealism inherent in reflective thought and allows one to think in concrete terms about how things work, both in the present, real world and in history.\n\nMarx identifies sublation as the manner in which material, historical conditions develop. This is in stark contrast to the philosophical idealism of Hegel, for whom sublation reflects the agency of a specific \"Geist\" – a concept that has often been translated as \"mind\" or \"spirit\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13676233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13676233", "title": "Black sheep", "text": "Black sheep\n\nIn the English language, black sheep is an idiom used to describe an odd or disreputable member of a group, especially within a family. The term stems from the genetic effect in sheep whereby a recessive gene occasionally manifests in the birth of a sheep with black rather than white coloring; these sheep stand out in the flock and their wool was traditionally considered less valuable.\n\nThe term has typically been given negative implications, implying waywardness.\n\nIn psychology, the \"black sheep effect\" refers to the tendency of group members to judge likeable ingroup members more positively and deviant ingroup member more negatively than comparable outgroup members.\n\nIn most sheep, a white fleece is not albinism but a dominant gene that switches color production off, thus obscuring any other color that may be present. As a result, a black fleece in most sheep is recessive, so if a white ram and a white ewe are each heterozygous for black, in about 25 percent of cases they will produce a black lamb. In fact in most white sheep breeds only a few white sheep are heterozygous for black, so black lambs are usually much rarer than this.\n\nThe term originated from the occasional black sheep which are born into a flock of white sheep due to a genetic process of recessive traits. Black wool was considered commercially undesirable because it could not be dyed. In 18th and 19th century England, the black color of the sheep was seen as the mark of the devil. In modern usage, the expression has lost some of its negative connotations, though the term is usually given to the member of a group who has certain characteristics or lack thereof deemed undesirable by that group. Jessica Mitford described herself as \"the red sheep of the family\", a communist in a family of aristocratic fascists.\n\nThe idiom is also found in other languages, e.g. German, French, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Bosnian, Greek, Turkish, Hungarian, Dutch, Afrikaans, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Catalan, Czech, Slovak, Romanian and Polish. During the Second Spanish Republic a weekly magazine named \"El Be Negre\", meaning 'The Black Sheep', was published in Barcelona.\n\nThe same concept is illustrated in some other languages by the phrase \"white crow\": for example \"belaya vorona\" (белая ворона) in Russian and \"kalāg-e sefīd\" (کلاغ سفید) in Persian.\n\nIn 1988, Marques, Yzerbyt and Leyens conducted an experiment where Belgian students rated the following groups according to trait-descriptors (e.g. sociable, polite, violent, cold): unlikeable Belgian students, unlikeable North African students, likeable Belgian students, and likeable North African students. The results provided support that the favorability is the highest for likeable ingroup members and the lowest for unlikeable ingroup members, whereas the favorability of unlikeable and likeable outgroup members is between the both former ones. These extreme judgements of likeable and unlikeable (i.e., deviant) ingroup members, relatively to comparable outgroup members is called \"black sheep effect\". This effect has been shown in various intergroup contexts and under a variety of conditions, and in many experiments manipulating likeability and norm deviance.\n\nA prominent explanation of the black sheep effect derives from the social identity approach (social identity theory and self-categorization theory). Group members are motivated to sustain a positive and distinctive social identity and, as a consequence, group members emphasize likeable members and evaluate them more positive than outgroup members, bolstering the positive image of their ingroup (ingroup bias). Furthermore, the positive social identity may be threatened by group members who deviate from a relevant group norm. To protect the positive group image, ingroup members derogate ingroup deviants more harshly than deviants of an outgroup (Marques, Abrams, Páez, & Hogg, 2001).\n\nIn addition, Eidelman and Biernat showed in 2003 that personal identities are also threatened through deviant ingroup members. They argue that devaluation of deviant members is an individual response of \"interpersonal\" differentiation. Khan and Lambert suggested in 1998 that cognitive processes such as assimilation and contrast, which may underline the effect, should be examined.\n\nEven though there is widely support for the black sheep effect, the opposite pattern has been found, for example, that White participants judge unqualified Black targets more negative than comparable White targets (e.g. Feldman, 1972; Linville & Jones, 1980). Consequently, there are several factors which influence the black sheep effect. For instance, the higher the identification with the ingroup, and the higher the entitativity of the ingroup, the more the black sheep effect emerges. Even situational factors explaining the deviance have an influence whether the black sheep effect occurs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "663263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=663263", "title": "Bracket (tournament)", "text": "Bracket (tournament)\n\nA bracket or tournament bracket is a tree diagram that represents the series of games played during a knockout tournament. Different knockout tournament formats have different brackets; the simplest and most common is that of the single-elimination tournament. The name \"bracket\" is American English, derived from the resemblance of the links in the tree diagram to the bracket punctuation symbol ] or [ (called a \"square bracket\" in British English). The closest British term is draw, although this implies an element of chance, whereas some brackets are determined entirely by seeding.\n\nIn some tournaments, the full bracket is determined before the first match. In such cases, fans may enjoy trying to predict the winners of the initial round and of the consequent later matchups. This is called \"bracketology\", particularly in relation to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship. This prediction is not possible in tournaments, such as the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League, in which the pairings for a later round are not made until after the previous round has been played.\n\nBrackets are commonly found in major North American professional sports leagues and in U.S. college sports. Often, at the end of the regular season, the league holds a post-season tournament (most commonly called a playoff) to determine which team is the best out of all of the teams in the league. This is done because often in American professional sports there are at least two different conferences, and teams mostly play other teams in their own conference. Examples of this are the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference in the NFL, the American League and the National League in Major League Baseball, and the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference in the NBA or NHL.\n\nWhen there are only two different conferences, there are two sides of the bracket. One conference is on one side, while the other is on the opposite side. Each side is organized according to a team's seeding; higher-seeded teams are matched against lower-seeded teams. Teams that qualify for the post-season tournament only compete against teams in their own conference, until only one team from each conference remains. These two teams, called the conference champions, play each other to determine the best in the league. Other leagues, like the NHL, have two conferences, each of which is divided into divisions, usually by region. In the post-season tournament, only the teams with the best records qualify, with the exception of the division leader (and also #2 and #3 in the division in the NHL) having an automatic entry into the tournament.\n\nMost North American professional post-season tournaments are single-elimination format. If a bye is required, the top seeded teams usually get the bye. There is usually no third place match to separate the third and fourth place teams.\n\nThe concept is even more visible in college sports, most notably in reference to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, in which millions of casual and serious fans \"fill out brackets\"—predict the winners of each game in the tournament—in both formal contests, sponsored by various corporations, and informal betting pools among friends or colleagues. The brackets are much larger than those in North American professional leagues—while no more than 16 teams qualify for the postseason in any major North American league (this is the case in the NBA and NHL), 68 teams (out of over 350) advance to the NCAA men's tournament, with most bracket contests involving 64 of these teams.\nThe diagrams for formats other than single-elimination are more complex than a simple tree.\n"}

Identity formation is a complex process that is never completed. When we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions 'Who we are?', 'Do we choose our identity?', 'Is identity given to us or do we create our own?', etc. In a world of change, children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities. Children begin to ask identity questions at an early age. Who am I? Who is my family? Where do I belong? Why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others? These are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world. \nErik Erikson (1902–1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity. The child identity is a complex socio-cultural phenomenon, which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves, about the world, about his place in this world. The Child Identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing under the influence of the environment, education and family. In childhood, identity is a dependent phenomenon, there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns, relationships child with world. Child Identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes. \n\nErik Erikson was one of the first scientists who described the problems of identity of teenagers and crisis identity. The development of identity was one of Erikson's greatest concerns in his theory. When Anna Freud worked with different children, she opened many original forms of their psychological life. For example, she was the first who described phenomenon 'Identification with the Aggressor' (The Ego, 1936). According to her it was a defense mechanism that was used to “protect the self from hurt and disorganization”.\nAnthropologists have most frequently employed the term ‘identity’ to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely Eriksonian way (Erikson 1972) properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others. Identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the 1970s. One of the most interesting research about some elements of ethnic, cultural and gender children's identity was described by Margaret Mead. Jean S. Phinney developed a three stage model of ethnic identity development (1992) based on research with minority adolescents combined with other ego identity and ethnic identity models.\n\nSocieties are shared communities with complex codes and organizational structures. Socialization is the process by which individuals adapt to and internalize the norms, values, customs, and behaviors of a shared social group (see Lutfey & Mortimer, 2006; Parsons, 1951). The degree to which children learn how to participate and be accepted by society has important consequences for their development and future lives. Importantly, the social codes that children and adolescents learn are specific not only to nation-states and regions of the globe, but also to historical periods and social groups within larger societies. The socio-historical context is a critical dimension of the socialization of children and adolescents, both with respect to their status within society (as compared to adults) as well as their social roles.\n\nChild Identity is in its general sense self-awareness and other-awareness; how much child knows about his likes and dislikes, his beliefs about who he is and what he thinks his capabilities are. Identity is one of key part of child's development. As child's sense of self develops, so does her ability to be successful in school and in social relationships. Just as self-esteem is how he feels about himself, identity is how he thinks about herself. A child with a strong sense of identity might state, “I am a short person, I like pizza, and I am funny.” [9]\nRelationships with family members, other adults and children, friends and members of his community play a key role in building child identity. Child Identity includes many questions such as problems of gender identity, cultural identity, social identity, national identity and others forms of identities. ( 1)\n\nToday there are many new frames for forming identity of a child. The Child Identity is modern ontological construct. For example, hybrid identity is a result of globalization. Therefore we have phenomenon of third culture kid (TCK, 3CK) or 'children of global nomads'. Children raised as global nomads can be the offspring of diplomatic, international business, government agency, international agency, missionary, or military personnel, or indeed of people living internationally mobile lives for any professional reason. Typically, global nomads share a unique cultural heritage.\nFor many global nomads, nationality will form but one part of a complex identity influenced also by the host countries in which they have lived, by the experience of mobility itself, and by a multicultural heritage forged within one or more international expatriate communities.\nThe internet has become a big part of contemporary children’s life. In the 21st century, this typically involves engagement in virtual play worlds. As children play video game s, aspects of their real world and virtual identities interact and learning takes place. Children’s Construction of Identity in Virtual Play Worlds (or online child identity) is one of new research aspects of child identity.\nMobile child identity is influenced by his (her) use of media, in particular personal communication media such as the mobile phone. On the other hand, it also implies a view of adolescent identity as mobile, changing and developing moment by moment and over time, as very sensitive to changes in the relations between friends and families, and to the emotional and intellectual challenges experienced and mediated through the use of the mobile phone (among other factors).\n\nEverybody has a sense of self or sense of personal identity. In fact most people have a number of important ways of thinking about themselves that are significant enough to be considered multiple senses of self. The sense of self includes those roles, attributes, behaviors, etc. These sense-of-self associations can be based on any combination of the following occupations, social relationships, familial relationships, abilities/disabilities, spirituality and others.\nIn the first few hours of life, children can tell one smell from another, one voice from another-and they prefer their mother's smell and voice to all others. Attachment is part of the process of identity formation. As infants grow emotionally close to certain people, they associate how those people smell, touch, sound; in this way, they are able to recognize their \"special people\" early on.\n\nChildren as young as four years old have a sense of self that is based on some salient attributes that the child considers important and is maintained over time, for example, “I am the strongest or fastest boy in my class” or “I am smart; I figure things out easily” or “I am good at helping people”. Identities are often imposed or at least encouraged by environmental or cultural forces.\n\nChildren acquire their sense of self and self-esteem slowly as they mature into adolescents. Furthermore, children do not always feel good about themselves or their behaviors in every situation. Identities are developed over time and may change from time to time and place to place. Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment and alienated the next. Emotional stability and acceptance at home and among school staff are important during these times.\n\n“Construction of identity” is rarely a deliberate, self-conscious process. Early in life, sense of self is associated with the security, protection, and acceptance that infants, toddlers, and preschoolers feel when effectively cared for by adults to whom they feel an attachment. By the late preschool years and early school years, sense of self comes to be additionally associated – positively or negatively – with attributes that parents value and model for their children in the way they live their lives. Over the school years, peer values and peer pressure come to play an increasingly influential role in how older children and young adolescents think about themselves. “Cliques” – the “in crowd” versus the “out crowd” – become important components of identity. Identities that have been strongly developed prior to these years often protect against the developmental difficulties associated with these years.\n\n\n"}

But a special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that in the last 150 years fossil fuels and cement production were responsible for only about two-thirds of climate change: the other third has been caused by human land use.\n\nThe three main greenhouse gases produced by unsustainable land use are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.\nBlack carbon or soot can also be caused by unsustainable land use, and, although not a gas, can behave like greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.\n\nCarbon dioxide, , is a natural part of the carbon cycle, but human land uses often add more, especially from habitat destruction and the cultivation of soil. When woodlands, wetlands, and other natural habitats are turned into pasture, arable fields, buildings and roads, the carbon held in the soil and vegetation becomes extra carbon dioxide and methane to trap more heat in the atmosphere.\n\nGardeners may cause extra carbon dioxide to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:\n\n\nGardeners will also be responsible for extra carbon dioxide when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel.\n\nMethane, CH, is a natural part of the carbon cycle, but human land uses often add more, especially from anaerobic soil, artificial wetlands such as rice fields, and from the guts of farm animals, especially ruminants such as cattle and sheep.\n\nGardeners may cause extra methane to be added to the atmosphere in several ways:\n\n\nNitrous oxide, NO, is a natural part of the nitrogen cycle, but human land uses often add more.\n\nGardeners may cause extra nitrous oxide to be added to the atmosphere by:\n\n\nBlack carbon is not a gas, but it acts like a greenhouse gas because it can be suspended in the atmosphere and absorb heat.\n\nGardeners may cause extra black carbon to be added to the atmosphere by burning garden prunings and weeds on bonfires, especially if the waste is wet and becomes black carbon in the form of soot. Gardeners will also be responsible for extra black carbon produced when they buy garden products which have been transported by vehicles powered by fossil fuel especially the diesel used in most lorries.\n\nThere are many ways in which climate-friendly gardeners may reduce their contribution to climate change and help their gardens absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners can find good ideas in many other sustainable approaches:\n\nClimate-friendly gardening includes actions which protect carbon stores beyond gardens. The biggest carbon stores in land are in soil; the two habitat types with the biggest carbon stores per hectare are woods and wetlands; and woods absorb more carbon dioxide per hectare per year than most other habitats. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore aim to ensure that nothing they do will harm these habitats.\n\nAccording to Morison and Morecroft (eds.)'s \"Plant Growth and Climate Change\", the net primary productivity (the net amount of carbon absorbed each year) of various habitats is:\n\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report \"Land use, land-use change, and forestry\"  lists the carbon contained in different global habitats as:\n\n\nThe figures quoted above are global averages. More recent research in 2009 has found that the habitat with the world's highest known total carbon density - 1,867 tonnes of carbon per hectare - is temperate moist forest of Eucalyptus regnans in the Central Highlands of south-east Australia; and, in general, that temperate forests contain more carbon than either boreal forests or tropical forests.\n\nAccording to Milne and Brown's 1997 paper \"Carbon in the vegetation and soils of Great Britain\", Britain's vegetation and soil are estimated to contain 9952 million tonnes of carbon, of which almost all is in the soil, and most in Scottish peatland soil:\n\n\nA 2005 report suggested that British woodland soil may contain as much as 250 tonnes of carbon per hectare.\n\nMany studies of soil carbon only study the carbon in the top 30 centimetres, but soil is often much deeper than that, especially below woodland. One 2009 study of the United Kingdom's carbon stores by Keith Dyson and others gives figures for soil carbon down to 100 cm below the habitats, including \"Forestland\", \"Cropland\" and \"Grassland\", covered by the Kyoto Protocol reporting requirements.\n\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners choose peat-free composts because some of the planet's biggest carbon stores are in soil, and especially in the peatland soil of wetlands.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report \"Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\" gives a figure of 2011 gigatonnes of carbon for global carbon stocks in the top 1 metre of soils, much more than the carbon stores in the vegetation or the atmosphere.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners also avoid using tapwater not only because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to treat and pump water, but because if water is taken from wetlands then carbon stores are more likely to be oxidised to carbon dioxide.\n\nA climate-friendly garden therefore does not contain large irrigated lawns, but instead includes water-butts to collect rainwater; water-thrifty plants which survive on rainwater and do not need watering after they are established; trees, shrubs and hedges to shelter gardens from the drying effects of sun and wind; and groundcover plants and organic mulch to protect the soil and keep it moist.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners will ensure that any paved surfaces in their gardens (which are kept to a minimum to increase carbon stores) are permeable, and may also make rain gardens, sunken areas into which rainwater from buildings and paving is directed, so that the rain can then be fed back into groundwater rather than going into storm drains. The plants in rain gardens must be able to grow in both dry and wet soils.\n\nWetlands may store the most carbon in their soils, but woods store more carbon in their living biomass than any other type of vegetation, and their soils store the most carbon after wetlands. Climate-friendly gardeners therefore ensure that any wooden products they buy, such as garden furniture, have been made of wood from sustainably managed woodland.\n\nAfter rocks containing carbonate compounds, soil is the biggest store of carbon on land.\nCarbon is found in soil organic matter, including living organisms (plant roots, fungi, animals, protists, bacteria), dead organisms, and humus.\nOne study of the environmental benefits of gardens estimates that 86% of carbon stores in gardens is in the soil.\n\nThe first priorities for climate-friendly gardeners are, therefore, to:\n\nTo protect the soil, climate-friendly gardens:\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners avoid things which may harm soil. They do not tread on the soil when it is wet, because it is then most vulnerable to compaction. They dig as little is possible, and only when the soil is moist rather than wet, because cultivation increases the oxidation of soil organic matter and produces carbon dioxide.\n\nTo increase soil carbon stores, climate-friendly gardeners ensure that their gardens create optimal conditions for vigorous healthy growth of plants, and other garden organisms above and below ground, and reduce the impact of any limiting factors.\n\nIn general, the more biomass that the plants can create each year, the more carbon will be added to the soil.\nHowever, only some biomass each year becomes long-term soil carbon or humus. In \"Soil Carbon and Organic Farming\", a 2009 report for the Soil Association, Gundula Azeez discusses several factors which increase how much biomass is turned into humus. These include good soil structure, soil organisms such as fine root hairs, microorganisms, mycorrhizas and earthworms which increase soil aggregation, residues from plants (such as trees and shrubs) which have a high content of resistant chemicals such as lignin, and plant residues with a carbon to nitrogen ratio lower than about 32:1.\n\nClimate-friendly gardens therefore include:\n\n\nLawns, like other grasslands, can build up good levels of soil carbon, but they will grow more vigorously and store more carbon if besides grasses they also contain nitrogen-fixing plants such as clover, and if they are cut using a mulching mower which returns finely-chopped mowings to the lawn. More carbon, however, may be stored by other perennial plants such as trees and shrubs. They also do not need to be maintained using power tools.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners will also aim to increase biodiversity not only for the sake of the wildlife itself, but so that the garden ecosystem is resilient and more likely to store as much carbon as possible as long as possible. They will therefore avoid pesticides, and increase the diversity of the habitats within their gardens.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners can directly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from their own gardens, but can also use their gardens to indirectly reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gases elsewhere, for example by using the sun and wind to dry washing on washing lines in the garden instead of using electricity generated by fossil fuel to dry washing in tumble dryers.\n\nFood is a major contributor to climate change. In the United Kingdom, according to Tara Garnett of the Food Food Climate Research Network, food contributes 19% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSoil is the biggest store of carbon on land. It is therefore important to protect the soil organic matter in farmland. Farm animals, however, especially free-range pigs, may cause erosion, and cultivation of the soil increases the oxidation of soil organic matter into carbon dioxide. Other sources of greenhouse gases from farmland include: compaction caused by farm machinery or overgrazing by farm animals can make soil anaerobic and produce methane; farm animals produce methane; and nitrogen fertilizers can be converted to nitrous oxide.\n\nMost farmland consists of fields growing annual arable crops which are eaten directly by people or fed to farm animals, and grassland used as pasture, hay or silage to feed farm animals. Some perennial food plants are also grown, such as fruits and nuts in orchards, and watercress grown in water.\n\nAlthough all cultivation of the soil in arable fields produces carbon dioxide, some arable crops cause more damage to soil than others. Root crops such as potatoes and sugar-beet, and crops which are harvested not just once a year but over a long period such as green vegetables and salads, are considered \"high risk\" in catchment-sensitive farming.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners therefore grow at least some of their food, and may choose food crops which therefore help to keep carbon in farmland soils if they grow such high-risk crops in small vegetable plots in their gardens, where it is easier to protect the soil than in large fields under commercial pressures. Climate-friendly gardeners may grow and eat plants such as sweet cicely which sweeten food, and so reduce the land area needed for sugar-beet. \nThey may also choose to grow perennial food plants to not only reduce their indirect greenhouse gas emissions from farmland, but also to increase carbon stores in their own gardens.\n\nGrassland contains more carbon per hectare than arable fields, but farm animals, especially ruminants such as cattle or sheep, produce large amounts of methane, directly and from manure heaps and slurry. Slurry and manure may also produce nitrous oxide. \nGardeners who want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions can help themselves to eat less meat and dairy produce by growing nut trees which are a good source of tasty, protein-rich food, including walnuts which are an excellent source of the omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid.\n\nResearchers and farmers are investigating and improving ways of farming which are more sustainable, such as agroforestry, forest farming, wildlife-friendly farming, soil management, catchment-sensitive farming (or water-friendly farming). For example, the organisation Farming Futures assists farmers in the United Kingdom to reduce their farms' greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFarmers are aware that consumers are increasingly asking for \"green credentials\". Gardeners who understand climate-friendly practices can advocate their use by farmers.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners aim to reduce their consumption in general. In particular, they try to avoid or reduce their consumption of tapwater because of the greenhouse gases emitted when fossil fuels are burnt to supply the energy needed to treat and pump it to them. Instead, gardeners can garden using only rainwater.\n\nGreenhouse gases are produced in the manufacture of many materials and products used by gardeners. For example, it takes a lot of energy to produce synthetic fertilizers, especially nitrogen fertilizers. Ammonium nitrate, for example, has an embodied energy of 67000 kilojoules/kilogramme, so climate-friendly gardeners will choose alternative ways of ensuring the soil in their gardens has optimal levels of nitrogen by alternative means such as nitrogen-fixing plants.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners will also aim to follow \"cradle-to-cradle design\" and \"circular economy\" principles: when they choose to buy or make something, it should be possible to take it apart again and recycle or compost every part, so that there is no waste, only raw materials to be made into something else. \nThis will reduce the greenhouse gases otherwise produced when extracting raw materials.\n\nGardeners can reduce not only their food miles by growing some of their own food, but also their \"gardening miles\" by reducing the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by mail order from a specialist nursery if the plants are sent out bare-root, reducing transport demand and the use of peat-based composts; or growing plants from seed, which will also increase genetic diversity and therefore resilience; or growing plants vegetatively from cuttings or offsets from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners can use their gardens in ways which reduce greenhouse gas emissions from homes by:\n\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners may also choose to reduce their own personal greenhouse gas emissions by growing and eating carminative plants such as fennel and garlic which reduce intestinal gases such as methane.\n\nThere are some patent sources of greenhouse gas emissions in gardens and some more latent.\n\nPower tools which are powered by diesel or petrol, or electricity generated by burning other fossil fuels, emit carbon dioxide. Climate-friendly gardeners may therefore choose to use hand tools rather than power tools, or power tools powered by renewable electricity, or design their gardens to reduce or remove a need to use power tools. For example, they may choose dense, slow-growing species for hedges so that the hedges only need to be cut once a year.\n\nLawns need[?] to be cut by lawn mowers and, in drier parts of the world, are often irrigated by tapwater. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore do what they can to reduce this consumption by:\n\n\nGreenhouses can be used to grow crops which might otherwise be imported from warmer climates, but if they are heated by fossil fuel then they may cause more greenhouse gas emissions than they save. Climate-friendly gardeners will therefore use their greenhouses carefully by:\n\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners will not put woody prunings on bonfires, which will emit carbon dioxide and black carbon, but instead burn them indoors in a wood-burning stove and therefore cut emissions from fossil fuel, or cut them up to use as mulch and increase soil carbon stores, or add the smaller prunings to compost heaps to keep them aerated, reducing methane emissions. To reduce the risk of fire, they will also choose fire-resistant plants from habitats which are not prone to wildfires and which do not catch fire easily, rather than fire-adapted plants from fire-prone habitats which are flammable and adapted to encourage fires and then gain a competitive advantage over less resistant species.\n\nClimate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted plants such as comfrey to bring nutrients closer to the surface topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the anaerobic conditions under water may emit methane.\n\nNitrogen fertilizers may be oxidised to nitrous oxide, especially if fertilizer is applied in excess, or when plants are not actively growing. Climate-friendly gardeners may choose instead to use nitrogen-fixing plants which will add nitrogen to the soil without increasing nitrous oxide emissions.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Durkheim, a community or society may at times come together and simultaneously communicate the same thought and participate in the same action. Such an event then causes collective effervescence which excites individuals and serves to unify the group.\n\nCollective effervescence is the basis for Émile Durkheim's theory of religion as laid out in his 1912 volume \"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\". Durkheim argues that the universal religious dichotomy of profane and sacred results from the lives of these tribe members: most of their life is spent performing menial tasks such as hunting and gathering. These tasks are profane. The rare occasions on which the entire tribe gathers together become sacred, and the high energy level associated with these events gets directed onto physical objects or people which also become sacred.\n\nThe force is thus associated with the totem which is the symbol of the clan, mentioned by Durkheim in his study of \"elementary forms\" of religion in Aboriginal societies. Because it provides the tribe's name, the symbol is present during the gathering of the clan. Its presence during these scenes, the totem comes to represent both the scene and the strong emotional felt, thus becoming a collective representation of the group.\n\nFor Durkheim, religion is a fundamentally social phenomenon. The beliefs and practices of the sacred are a method of social organization. This explanation is detailed in \"Elementary Forms\" \"Book 2/The Elementary Beliefs\", chapter 7, \"Origins of These Beliefs: Origin of the Idea of the Totemic Principle or Mana\". According to Durkheim, \"god and society are one of the same…the god of the clan…can be none other than the clan itself, but the clan transfigured and imagined in the physical form of a plant or animal that serves as a totem.\"\n\nThe group members experience a feeling of a loss of individuality and unity with the gods and according to Durkheim, thus with the group.\n\n"}
{"id": "44182725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44182725", "title": "Composite Higgs models", "text": "Composite Higgs models\n\nIn particle physics, composite Higgs models (CHM) are speculative extensions of the Standard Model (SM) where the Higgs boson is a bound state of new strong interactions. These scenarios are the leading alternative to supersymmetric models for physics beyond the SM presently tested at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva.\n\nAccording to CHM the recently discovered Higgs boson is not an elementary particle (or point-like) but has finite size, typically around 10 meters. This dimension is related to the Fermi scale (100 GeV) that determines the strength of the weak interactions such as in β-decay. Microscopically the composite Higgs will be made of smaller constituents in the same way as nuclei are made protons and neutrons.\n\nThe main prediction of CHM are new particles with mass around a TeV that are excitations of the composite Higgs. This is analogous to the resonances in nuclear physics. The new particles could be produced and detected in collider experiments if the energy of the collision exceeds their mass and/or could produce deviations from the SM predictions in \"low energy observables\" — results of experiments at lower energies. Within the most compelling scenarios each Standard Model particle has a partner with equal quantum numbers but heavier mass. For example, the photon, W and Z bosons have heavy replicas with mass determined by the compositeness scale, expected around 1 TeV.\n\nCHM are motivated by the so-called naturalness or hierarchy problem of the SM, the difficulty to explain the different energy scales that appear in the fundamental interactions of particle physics, in particular, the large difference between the mass of the Higgs boson and the Planck scale. CHM can solve the naturalness problem because the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle so that a new energy scale exists that can be explained dynamically similarly to the mass of the proton. Naturalness requires that new particles exist with mass around a TeV and these could be discovered at LHC or future experiments. As of 2018, no direct or indirect signs that the Higgs or other SM particles are composite has been detected.\n\nCHM were introduced in the early '80s as an extension of technicolor theories to allow for the presence of a physical Higgs boson. At the time this was not required by the data but recent discoveries have shown the necessity of a physical Higgs doublet to break the electro-weak symmetry. This differs from ordinary technicolor theories where strong dynamics directly breaks the electro-weak symmetry without the need of a physical Higgs boson. The first CHM proposed by Georgi and Kaplan were based on known gauge theory dynamics that produces the Higgs doublet as a Goldstone boson. These models are very constrained and it is difficult to include fermion masses. The subject remained dormant for several years until it was realized that this type of models naturally arise in 5 dimensional theories known as Randall–Sundrum scenarios. Within these constructions enough freedom exists to build realistic models at the price of abandoning a full microscopic description. It was soon understood that these scenarios can also be realized in hypothetical strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFT) also providing a dynamical explanation for the generation of hierarchies. The connection between Randall-Sundrum models and CFTs is rooted in the AdS-CFT correspondence. This spurred a great deal of activity in the field. At first the Higgs was a generic scalar bound state. In the highly influential work the Higgs as a Goldstone boson was realized in Randall-Sundrum models and in CFTs. Detailed phenomenological studies showed that within this framework agreement with experimental data can be obtained with a mild tuning of parameters.\n\nCHM can be characterized by the mass (M) of the lightest new particles and their coupling (g). The latter is expected to be larger than the SM couplings for consistency. Various realizations of CHM exist that differ for the mechanism that generates the Higgs doublet. Broadly they can be divided in two categories:\nIn both cases the electro-weak symmetry is broken by the condensation of a Higgs scalar doublet. In the first type of scenario there is no a priori reason why the Higgs boson is lighter than the other composite states and moreover larger deviations from the SM are expected.\n\nIn this scenario the existence of the Higgs boson follows from the symmetries of the theory. This allows to explain why this particle is lighter than the rest of the composite particles whose mass is expected from direct and indirect tests to be around a TeV or higher. It is assumed that the composite sector has a global symmetry G spontaneously broken to a subgroup H where G and H are compact Lie groups. Contrary to technicolor models the unbroken symmetry must contain the SM electro-weak group SU(2)xU(1). According to Goldstone's theorem the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry produces massless scalar particles known as Goldstone bosons. By appropriately choosing the global symmetries it is possible to have Goldstone bosons that correspond to the Higgs doublet in the SM. This can be done in a variety of ways and is completely determined by the symmetries. In particular group theory determines the quantum numbers of the Goldstone bosons. From the decomposition of the adjoint representation one finds,\nwhere R[Π] is the representation of the Goldstone bosons under H. The phenomenological request that a Higgs doublet exists selects the possible symmetries. Typical example is the pattern\nthat contains a single Higgs doublet as a Goldstone boson.\n\nThe physics of the Higgs as a Goldstone boson is strongly constrained by the symmetries and determined by the symmetry breaking scale f that controls their interactions. An approximate relation exists between mass and coupling of the composite states,\nformula_3\nIn CHM one finds that deviations from the SM are proportional to,\nwhere v=246 GeV is the electro-weak vacuum expectation value. By construction these models approximate the SM to arbitrary precision if ξ is sufficiently small. For example, for the model above with SO(5) global symmetry the coupling of the Higgs to W and Z bosons is modified as,\nPhenomenological studies suggest f > 1 TeV and thus at least a factor of a few larger than v. However the tuning of parameters required to achieve v < f is inversely proportional to ξ so that viable scenarios require some degree of tuning.\n\nGoldstone bosons generated from the spontaneous breaking of an exact global symmetry are \"exactly\" massless. Therefore if the Higgs boson is a Goldstone boson the global symmetry cannot be exact. In CHM the Higgs potential is generated by effects that explicitly break the global symmetry G. Minimally these are the SM Yukawa and gauge couplings that cannot respect the global symmetry but other effects can also exist. The top coupling is expected to give a dominant contribution to the Higgs potential as this is the largest coupling in the SM. In the simplest models one finds a correlation between the Higgs mass and the mass M of the top partners,\nIn models with f~TeV as suggested by naturalness this indicates fermionic resonances with mass around 1 TeV. Spin-1 resonances are expected to be somewhat heavier. This is within the reach of future collider experiments.\n\nOne of the key ingredients of modern realizations of CHM is the hypothesis of partial compositeness originally proposed by D. B. Kaplan. This hypothesis is automatically realized in Randall-Sundrum scenarios. Every SM particle has a heavy partner that can mix with it. In practice the SM particles are linear combinations of elementary and composite states:\nwhere α denotes the mixing angle. Partial compositeness is naturally realized in the gauge sector where an analogous phenomenon happens quantum chromodynamics and is known as photon–ρ mixing. For fermions it is an assumption that in particular requires the existence of heavy fermions with equal quantum numbers to SM quarks and leptons. These interact with the Higgs through the mixing. One schematically finds the formula for the SM fermion masses,\nwhere L and R refer to the left and right mixings, and Y is a composite sector coupling.\n\nThe composite particles are multiplets of the unbroken symmetry H. For phenomenological reasons this should contain the custodial symmetry SU(2)xSU(2) extending the electro-weak symmetry SU(2)xU(1). Composite fermions often belong to representations larger than the SM particles. For example, a strongly motivated representation for left-handed fermions is the (2,2) that contains particles with exotic electric charge 5/3 or –4/3 with special experimental signatures.\n\nPartial compositeness ameliorates the phenomenology of CHM providing a logic why no deviations from the SM have been measured so far. In the so-called anarchic scenarios the hierarchies of SM fermion masses are generated through the hierarchies of mixings and anarchic composite sector couplings. The light fermions are almost elementary while the third generation is strongly or entirely composite. This leads to a structural suppression of all effects that involve first two generations that are the most precisely measured. In particular flavor transitions and corrections to electro-weak observables are suppressed. Other scenarios are also possible with different phenomenology.\n\nThe main experimental signatures of CHM are:\n\nSupersymmetric models also predict that every Standard Model particle will have a heavier partner. However, in supersymmetry the partners have a different spin: they are bosons if the SM particle is a fermion, and \"vice versa\". In composite Higgs models the partners have the same spin as the SM particles.\n\nAll the deviations from the SM are controlled by the tuning parameter ξ. The mixing of the SM particles determines the coupling with the known particles of the SM. The detailed phenomenology depends strongly on the flavor assumptions and is in general model-dependent. The Higgs and the top quark typically have the largest coupling to the new particles. For this reason third generation partners are the most easy to produce and top physics has the largest deviations from the SM. Top partners have also special importance given their role in the naturalness of the theory.\n\nAfter the first run of the LHC direct experimental searches exclude third generation fermionic resonances up to 800 GeV. Bounds on gluon resonances are in the multi-TeV range and somewhat weaker bounds exist for electro-weak resonances.\n\nDeviations from the SM couplings is proportional to the degree of compositeness of the particles. For this reason the largest departures from the SM predictions are expected for the third generation quarks and Higgs couplings. The first have been measured with per mille precision by the LEP experiment. After the first run of the LHC the couplings of the Higgs with fermions and gauge bosons agree with the SM with a precision around 20%. These results pose some tension for CHM but are compatible with a compositeness scale f~TeV.\n\nThe hypothesis of partial compositeness allows to suppress flavor violation beyond the SM that is severely constrained experimentally. Nevertheless, within anarchic scenarios sizable deviations from the SM predictions exist in several observables. Particularly constrained is CP violation in the Kaon system and lepton flavor violation for example the rare decay μ->eγ. Overall flavor physics suggests the strongest indirect bounds on anarchic scenarios. This tension can be avoided with different flavor assumptions.\n"}

These conceptual models facilitate discussion as in \"anywhere on the conflict continuum\".\n\nElise M. Boulding was a Quaker sociologist influenced by the events of World War II. Examining how war becomes peace, she posited a continuum between Wars of Extermination and Transformation.\n\nThis is Boulding’s conflict continuum: War of extermination, Limited war, Threat systems (deterrence), Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation (exchange), Mutual adaptation, Alliance, Co-operation, Integration, Transformation.\n\nTheorist Andra Medea seeks to explain how individuals, small groups, organizations, families, ethnicities, and even whole nations function when disputes arise between them. She posits that there are four types or levels of conflict, each operating under distinct rules: 1) \"Problem Solving\"; 2) \"Domination\"; 3) \"Blind Behavior\"; 4) \"Rogue Messiah\".\n\nEach level moving from first to fourth is characterized by increasing degrees of separation from reality, and decreasing degrees of maturity, in this context, defined as the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Problem-solving behavior is based in reality and maturity, and is therefore more rational and mature than domination. Domination is more rational and mature than blind behavior, which is more rational and mature than the Rogue Messiah.\n\nHowever, each level moving from fourth to first is more capable than the one below it at forcing victory in a conflict. The Rogue Messiah overpowers blind behavior, blind behavior thwarts domination, and domination deadlocks Problem-solving.\n"}

The soul of the primordial bovine – \"geush urvan\" – returned to the world as the soul of livestock. Although \"geush urvan\" is an aspect of the primordial bovine in Zoroastrian tradition, and may also be that in the Younger Avesta, the relationship between the two is unclear in the oldest texts.\n\nAlthough Avestan \"gav-\" \"cow\" is grammatically feminine, the word is also used as a singular for the collective \"cattle\". In English language translations Gavaevodata is often referred to in gender-neutral terms as \"primordial ox\". Other translations refer to Gavaevodata as a bull (\"cf.\" ). The \"-aevo.data\" of the name literally means \"created as one\" or \"solely created\" or \"uniquely created\".\n\nGavaevodata is only alluded to in the surviving texts of the Avesta, referred to by name in only two hymns. In other instances, for example in \"Yasht\" 13.85, the primordial beast is mentioned among the six material creations, but not by name. Elsewhere, such as in the Gathic Avestan \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\", prayers are offered on behalf of the soul of the cow (\"geush urvan\", \"Y.\" 35), or worship is offered to \"the cow's soul, and to her created body\" (\"Y\". 39), but in neither case is Gavaevodata mentioned by name, nor is it clear (unlike in Zoroastrian tradition) whether the soul of the cow is the soul of Gavaevodata.\n\nThis is also the case for \"The Cow's Lament\" in \"Yasna\" 29, which – as a \"Gatha\" – is attributed to Zoroaster himself, and is thus the subject of a great deal of interpretation. In this allegorical text, the soul of the cow (\"geush urvan\") despairs over the wretched condition to which the forces of deceit (\"druj\") have subjected her (see myth, below), and over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. The divinities hold council, and decide that Zoroaster is the only one who can alleviate her condition. At first she laments even more, holding Zoroaster to be incompetent, but finally accepts his assistance.\n\nAt least two levels of meaning have been inferred from this text (): The maltreated creature symbolizes the plight of Zoroaster's community, and the soul of the primordial beast is a metaphor for the message that Zoroaster has received from Mazda. In verse 3 of the litany to the moon (\"Mah Niyayesh\" 3), Gavaevodata is invoked as (or together with) the \"bovine of many species\" in the care of the moon Mah, specifically \"måŋha- gaociθra-\" \"the moon that keeps in it the \"cithra\" of cattle,\" which is a stock epithet of \"Mah\" (\"Yasht\" 7.3, 7.5, 7.6, \"GBd\" VIe.2-3, VII.5-6 etc.)\n\nIn the 30 hymns to the divinities of the Zoroastrian calendar month, Gavaevodata is again invoked in the verses nominally dedicated to the Moon. In both \"Siroza\" 1.12 and 2.12, Mah is again referred to as \"the Moon containing the \"cithra\" of cattle,\" and Gavaevodata is again referred to as (or in the company of) the \"Bovine of many species.\"\n\nThe mythology of the \"uniquely created bovine\" that is only alluded to in the extant Avesta appears fully developed in the 9th-11th century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In these texts, Avestan Gavaevodata appears as Middle Persian \"gaw i ew-dad\" or \"ewazdad\" or \"ewagdad,\" and retains the same literal meaning as the Avestan language form.\n\nAs also for all other Zoroastrian cosmological beliefs, the primary source of information on the primordial ox is the \"Bundahishn\", a 9th-century text. In this text, the primordial ox is a hermaphrodite, having both milk (\"Ibd\" 43.15) and semen (\"Ibd\" 94.4). It is \"white, bright like the moon, and three measured poles in height\" (\"Gbd\" Ia.12). The uniquely created ox lived its life on the river Veh. Daiti (\"Gbd\" Ia.12), and on the opposite bank lived Gayomart/d (Avestan \"Gayo maretan\"), the mythical first human.\n\nGawi ewdad's role in the creation myth runs as follows: During the first three-thousand year period, Ahura Mazda's (\"Ormuzd\") fashioned the bovine as His fourth or fifth of six primordial material creations. At the beginning of the second three-thousand year period, Angra Mainyu (\"Ahriman\") attacked the world, and the Creator responded by placing the primordial plant, bovine, and human in the respective heavenly spheres of the stars, moon and sun (\"IBd\" 7). But Ahriman assaulted the sky and Ormuzd fed the bovine \"medicinal \"mang\"\" (\"mang bēšaz\") to lessen its suffering (\"GBd\" IV.20). The bull immediately became feeble, and then died.\n\nBut as it lay dying its \"chihr\" was rescued and carried to \"the moon station.\" In the care of the moon, the \"chihr\" of the beast was purified and became the male and female pairs of the animals \"of many species.\" After the ox's death, fifty-five kinds of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants grew from its marrow (\"Ibd\" 10). In another passage (\"Ibd\" 93.11, \"cf\" an equivalent passage in \"Zadspram\"), the \"Bundahishn\" speaks of sesame, lentils, leeks, grapes, mustard and marjoram issuing from various other parts of its body. For example, lentils from the liver and mustard from the lungs (\"Ibd\" 14.1, \"Gbd\" XIII.2). \n\nGoshorun (from Avestan \"geush urvan\"), the soul of the primordial bovine, escaped to the star, moon, and sun stations where she lamented the destruction of the world. She was not placated until Ormuzd shows her the \"fravashi\" of the yet-unborn Zoroaster (whose protection she would receive). Contented with the promise of protection, Goshorun then agreed to be \"created back to the world in livestock.\" (\"Gbd\" IVa.2ff, \"Ibd\"' 46.3ff., \"Denkard\" p.9).\n\n\n"}

Giants were a popular theme in theosophical literature, Atlantis, lost continents and later the earth mysteries movement of Britain in the 1970s. \n\nThe concept of giants was discussed by the theosophist and occult author Blavatsky who wrote about the existence of giants in her book \"The Secret Doctrine\" connecting them to her theory of root races and claiming they correspond with Hindu cycle of the universe. According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third root race who lived on the continent of Lemuria. Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.\n\nThe German occultist Guido von List was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together paganism, mythology, and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory. \n\nR. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, an Egyptologist and traditionalist, believed that giants had roamed the earth, and that after the fall of Adam, humanity fell into a state of degeneration.\n\nLewis Spence, a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched English folklore and mythology depicting such giants such as Magog and the British giant Albion. Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British journalist and author William Comyns Beaumont. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and archeology. Beaumont believed that Britain was the location of Atlantis and that it was occupied by a giant race of Aryans. \n\nIn the 1970s many of the authors of the earth mysteries movement in Britain wrote about Giants. John Michell wrote about the existence of giants in his book \"The View over Atlantis\". Anthony Roberts wrote the book \"Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History\" in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the British Isles and linked Alfred Watkins' ley lines to the British giants.\n"}

It is named after Alexander Grothendieck, who made extensive use of it in treating foundational aspects of algebraic geometry. Outside that field, it has been influential particularly on category theory and categorical logic.\n\nIn the usual formulation, the language of category theory is applied, to describe the point of view as treating, not objects \"X\" of a given category \"C\" as such, but morphisms\n\nwhere \"S\" is a fixed object. This idea is made formal in the idea of the slice category of objects of \"C\" 'above' S. To move from one slice to another requires a base change; from a technical point of view base change becomes a major issue for the whole approach (see for example Beck–Chevalley conditions).\n\nA base change 'along' a given morphism\n\nis typically given by the fiber product, producing an object over \"T\" from one over \"S\". The 'fiber' terminology is significant: the underlying heuristic is that \"X\" over \"S\" is a family of fibers, one for each 'point' of \"S\"; the fiber product is then the family on \"T\", which described by fibers is for each point of \"T\" the fiber at its image in \"S\". This set-theoretic language is too naïve to fit the required context, certainly, from algebraic geometry. It combines, though, with the use of the Yoneda lemma to replace the 'point' idea with that of treating an object, such as \"S\", as 'as good as' the representable functor it sets up.\n\nThe Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem from about 1956 is usually cited as the key moment for the introduction of this circle of ideas. The more classical types of Riemann–Roch theorem are recovered in the case where \"S\" is a single point (i.e. the final object in the working category \"C\"). Using other \"S\" is a way to have versions of theorems 'with parameters', i.e. allowing for continuous variation, for which the 'frozen' version reduces the parameters to constants.\n\nIn other applications, this way of thinking has been used in topos theory, to clarify the role of set theory in foundational matters. Assuming that we don’t have a commitment to one 'set theory' (all toposes are in some sense equally set theories for some intuitionistic logic) it is possible to state everything relative to some given set theory that acts as a base topos.\n\n"}

The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict. The Organisation consists of 57 participating States across North America, Europe and Asia. The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story” and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.\n\nThe creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s. The Yugoslav Wars were ethnic conflicts that broke out after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and of Communism, and which eventually resulted in the break up of the country. Efforts of the CSCE, European Union and United Nations failed to bring peace. The frustration at being unable to prevent such a devastating human tragedy led to the Netherlands government proposing the post of the HCNM. This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities. In regards to the Yugoslav tragedy, international efforts were deemed to have failed because of the limited knowledge of the international mediators of the ethnic situation. This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play. Further, any international aid that was provided came too late. It was recognised that such tensions should be identified and addressed as early as possible in order to prevent escalation into endless conflict. The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities. It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.\n\nMany concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands. As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.\n\nStates disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights. Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate. This prohibits the High Commissioner from considering “violations of CSCE commitments with regard to an individual person belonging to a national minority”. Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of \"ombudsman\" for national minorities. The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool. This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner \"on\" National Minorities, not \"for\" National Minorities.\n\nMany states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism. As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering ‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’. The international community further decided that the HCNM should not be able to ‘communicate with and (...) acknowledge communications from any person or organization which practices or publicly condones terrorism or violence’. In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interfering with their minority problems.\n\nThe HCNM’s mandate as defined at the Helsinki Summit meeting in 1992 contained many ambiguities, the most significant of which is the definition of “national minorities”. No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term. This was largely because the CSCE participating states could not come to an agreement on the definition of \"national minorities\", and therefore opted to provide no definition at all.\n\nThe first High Commissioner, Max van der Stoel, focused on clarifying and defining his mandate. He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing a set of guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit. The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements. Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document, which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice. In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population. In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.\n\nThe main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict. This involves “early warning” of potential conflict followed by “early action” to dissolve tensions. The mandate authorises the HCNM to assess ‘the role of the parties directly concerned, the nature of the tensions and recent developments therein and, where possible, the potential consequences for peace and stability within the OSCE area’. Her most important role is not necessarily to completely resolve all potential conflicts, but rather to manage them in a way that the tension between groups does not escalate but declines. This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.\n\nUltimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy. She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation. Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language. The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts. The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, noted that the HCNM should aim to prevent disputes from arising into armed conflicts, but should also understand that in some cases the situation may go beyond the realm of preventative diplomacy. Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken. This may result in the High Commissioner issuing an early warning notice to the Permanent Council, alongside a request for the OSCE to issue her an ‘ad hoc’ mandate for late prevention of the conflict. An early warning notice under paragraph 15 of the mandate has only been issued once before, in regards to the 1999 Kosovo crisis.\n\nIn order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific. Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation. Van der Stoel always prepared extensively for any state involvement, often by organising a one- or two-day workshop with leading experts in several relevant areas. The importance of this approach arose due to the failures of the international community during the Yugoslav Wars, where a lack of understanding about the ethnic situation by international mediators often led to a worsening of the situation.\n\nThe work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful. The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation. Such knowledge and skill is invaluable in regards to conflict prevention involving minorities, because these situations are often very precarious and complex. No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences. There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.\n\nThe HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention. The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties. While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.\n\nThe High Commissioner will assist in preventing an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, which should be upheld by the state and other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, kin-states, policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention. The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as this is one of the major causes of inter-ethnic tension. However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language. The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict. This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.\n\nThe HCNM will also focus on improving communication between the parties involved, including leaders of the state and leaders of the opposing national groups. This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties. When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication. The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.\n\nIn order to develop a peaceful society the High Commissioner strives to ensure that all minority groups are sufficiently involved in public life, and are fairly represented at national, regional and local levels. By ensuring that minority groups are involved in decision-making processes and that they enjoy some level of influence, states can prevent these groups from becoming marginalised. Active and effective participation also provides remedies for groups who feel their rights are being violated, and in doing so can prevent such groups from seeking remedies in a more violent manner.\n\nImportantly, all governments may exercise a right of refusal against participation of the High Commissioner, and may prevent her from entering the country. In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.\n\nThe first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, was involved with inter-ethnic tensions in Ukraine between a substantial Russian minority and the Ukraine government from 1994 to 2001. His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions. This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace. Following the disintegration of the USSR and Ukrainian independence in 1991, tensions began to arise as Ukraine sought to establish its identity. In particular, these uneasy relations were caused by historical Russian domination over Ukraine, as well as the prevalence of Russian language in Ukrainian life. While the HCNM was not the only influential actor in managing and resolving these issues, he played a critical role in establishing movement towards peace.\n\nThe flexibility of the HCNM’s mandate and the nature of the role allowed van der Stoel to become involved in the tensions in Ukraine at a very early stage. He was able to craft a tactful and creative approach to dealing with the precarious issues that had arisen at that stage. The success of his work there is in large part credited to his ability to build a relationship of trust with the parties involved and to approach all issues from the basis of impartiality.\n\nThe HCNM was invited to Ukraine by the government in February 1994. In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension. The HCNM was involved in managing the relations between the Russian minority and the Ukrainian majority, the status of Crimea within Ukraine, and resettlement of the Crimean Tatars. Importantly, descent into violent conflict was prevented in all areas. However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role. The Ukrainian government was unwilling to implement the majority of his recommendations, even though it was consistently willing to engage with the HCNM. Therefore, while the HCNM ultimately played a critical role in conflict prevention in Ukraine, his ability to secure a sustainable solution across all areas of tension was often limited.\n\n\n\n"}

The participants were separated into two groups; the \"unfair decision condition\" (where the decision of being hired was left up to a single MBA student with sole authority listening to the interview) and the \"fair decision condition\" (where the decision was made by a team of MBA students who had to independently and unanimously decide the fate of the interviewee). Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast how they would feel if they were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict how they would feel ten minutes after hearing the news. Then following the interview, all participants were given letters notifying them they had not been selected for the job. All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness. Then after waiting ten minutes, the experimenter presented all the participants with another questionnaire that once again asked them to report their current level of happiness.\nThe predictions made by the participants in both the unfair and fair groups were about the same regarding how they would feel immediately after hearing the news as well as ten minutes later. Both groups accurately predicted how they would feel immediately after hearing the news. The study showed that both groups felt much better than they had originally predicted, ten minutes later, demonstrating the impact bias.\n\nExplanations for the occurrence of the impact bias include the following:\n\nMisconstrual of future events:\nWhen predicting how an experience will impact us emotionally, events which have not been experienced are particularly difficult. Often how we think an event may be like does not relate to how the experience is like.\n\nInaccurate theories:\nPeople have created cultural theories and had experiences that greatly influence beliefs of how an event will affect us. For example, our culture has emphasized a correlation between wealth and happiness, however despite this belief; money does not necessarily bring happiness.\n\nMotivated Distortions:\nWhen faced with a negative event people may have forecasts that are overestimated and can evoke either comfort or fear in the present. The overestimation however can often be used to soften the effects of an event or make it easier by the reality not being as extreme as the forecasted impact.\n\nUnder correction (anchoring and adjustment):\nPeople anchor their prediction on how they currently feel and never accurately adjust their prediction\n\nFocalism:\nOften when making a prediction of the impact of an event people focus solely on the event in question. This ignores the fact that with the passage of time, other events will occur that influence happiness.\n\nImmune Neglect:\nWe have unconscious psychological processes such as ego defense, dissonance reductions, self-serving biases, etc. that will cushion the effects of a negative event.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that 3, 4 and 5 year-old children show an impact bias for the intensity of their negative future emotions, but not their positive future emotions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "317465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317465", "title": "Inference", "text": "Inference\n\nInferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences. Charles Sanders Peirce divided inference into three kinds: deduction, induction, and abduction. Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. Induction is inference from particular premises to a universal conclusion. Abduction is inference to the best explanation.\n\nHuman inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of cognitive psychology; artificial intelligence researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.\n\nStatistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.\n\nThe process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called inductive reasoning. The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations. Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.\n\nThis definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: \"induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances.\" ) The definition given thus applies only when the \"conclusion\" is general.\n\nTwo possible definitions of \"inference\" are:\n\nAncient Greek philosophers defined a number of syllogisms, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:\n\nThe reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?\n\nThe validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word \"valid\" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference. An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true. But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.\n\nFor example, consider the form of the following symbological track:\n\nIf the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.\n\nNow we turn to an invalid form.\n\nTo show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.\n\nA valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):\n\nWhen a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.\n\nA valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:\n\nIn this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.\n\nEvidence: It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the Soviet Union. You read in the Moscow newspaper that a soccer team from a small city in Siberia starts winning game after game. The team even defeats the Moscow team. Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore. The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.\n\nKnowns: The Soviet Union is a command economy: people and material are told where to go and what to do. The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.\n\nExplanation: In a command economy, people and material are moved where they are needed. Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better. In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs. It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team. The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small. Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere? To hide them, of course.\n\nAn incorrect inference is known as a fallacy. Philosophers who study informal logic have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many biases in human reasoning that favor incorrect reasoning.\n\nAI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of expert systems and later business rule engines. More recent work on automated theorem proving has had a stronger\nbasis in formal logic.\n\nAn inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are relevant to its task.\n\nProlog (for \"Programming in Logic\") is a programming language based on a subset of predicate calculus. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called backward chaining.\n\nLet us return to our Socrates syllogism. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:\n\nThis states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:\n\ngives the answer \"Yes\".\n\nOn the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:\n\ngives the answer \"No\".\n\nThis is because Prolog does not know anything about Plato, and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called closed world assumption). Finally\n?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in \"Yes\" (and in some implementations: \"Yes\": X=socrates)\nProlog can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.\n\nRecently automatic reasoners found in semantic web a new field of application. Being based upon description logic, knowledge expressed using one variant of OWL can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.\n\nPhilosophers and scientists who follow the Bayesian framework for inference use the mathematical rules of probability to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability \"probability logic\", following E. T. Jaynes).\n\nBayesian's identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that \"it's going to rain tomorrow\" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.\n\nThrough the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see Bayesian decision theory). A central rule of Bayesian inference is Bayes' theorem.\n\nA relation of inference is monotonic if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is non-monotonic.\nDeductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.\n\nBy contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.\nWe know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of abduction, inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nInductive inference:\n\nAbductive inference:\n\nPsychological investigations about human reasoning:\n\n"}

It was conceived as a specific instance of the more general 'butterfly effect' encountered in chaos theory.\n\nThe innovation butterfly arises because many innovation systems are made up of a large number of elements that interact with each other via several non-linear feedback loops containing embedded delays, thus constituting a complex system.\n\nPerturbations can come from decisions made within the firm or from those made by its competitors, or they can result from external forces such as government legislation or environmental regulations, or unexpected spikes in the price of oil. How the innovation system evolves as a result of the innovation butterfly can lead ultimately to an innovative firm's success or failure.\n\nComplex systems, in domains such as physics, biology, or sociology, are known to be prone to both path dependence and emergent behavior. What makes the behavior of the innovation butterfly different is market selection, along with biases in individual and group decision making within distributed innovation settings, may influence the emergent behavior. Furthermore, managers in most fields of business endeavor to reduce uncertainty in order to better manage risk. In innovation settings, however, because success is based upon creativity, managers must actively embrace uncertainty. This leads to a management conundrum because innovation managers and management systems must encourage the potential for a butterfly effect but then must also learn how to cope with its aftermath.\n\nHow innovation butterflies are 'chased' is highly managerially relevant. Most butterflies end up 'merely' consuming a considerable amount of time and resources within a project, or for an innovation portfolio, within a firm. However, some butterflies can also unleash regime-altering emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment. Moreover, once these emergent outcomes begin to mature, and in some instances lead to disruptive innovations, they become extremely difficult to manage, Hence, shaping the innovation system before potential innovation butterfly's effects completely emerge is critical.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1465854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1465854", "title": "Key deer", "text": "Key deer\n\nThe Key deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus clavium\") is an endangered deer that lives only in the Florida Keys. It is a subspecies of the white-tailed deer (\"O. virginianus\"). It is the smallest North American deer.\n\nThis deer can be recognized by its characteristic size, smaller than all other white-tailed deer. Adult males (known as bucks) usually weigh and stand about tall at the shoulder. Adult females (does) usually weigh between and have an average height of at the shoulders. The deer is a reddish-brown to grey-brown in color. Antlers are grown by males and shed between February and March and regrown by June. When the antlers are growing, they have a white velvet coating. The species otherwise generally resembles other white-tailed deer in appearance.\n\nKey deer easily swim between islands. Living close to humans, they have little of the natural fear of man shown by most of their larger mainland relatives. The deer are often found in residents' yards and along roadsides where plants and flowers grow. This often results in car-to-deer collisions, as the deer are more active (and harder to avoid) at night. Seeing them at dusk and dawn is not unusual.\n\nBreeding occurs all year, but peaks in October and December. Territorial activity is limited to defending a receptive doe from other bucks. Longevity records are 9 years for males and 7 years for females. Adult females form loose matriarchal groups with one or two generations of offspring, while bucks feed and bed together only outside the breeding season.\n\nThe range of the Key deer originally encompassed all of the lower Florida Keys (where standing water pools exist), but is now limited to a stretch of the Florida Keys from about Sugarloaf Key to Bahia Honda Key. Key deer use all islands during the wet season when drinking water is more generally available, retreating to islands with a perennial supply of fresh water in dry months.\n\nKey deer inhabit nearly all habitats within their range, including pine rocklands, hardwood hammocks, mangroves, and freshwater wetlands. The species feeds on over 150 types of plants, but mangroves (red, white, and black) and thatch palm berries make up the most important parts of their diets. Pine rockland habitat is important, as well, because it is often the only reliable source of fresh drinking water (Key deer can tolerate drinking only mildly brackish water). Habitat destruction due to human encroachment causes many deer to feed on non-native ornamental plants.\n\nThe Key deer is a subspecies of white-tailed deer which migrated to the Florida Keys from the mainland over a land bridge during the Wisconsin glaciation. The earliest known written reference to Key deer comes from the writings of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a Spanish sailor shipwrecked in the Florida Keys and captured by Native Americans in the 1550s.\n\nKey deer were hunted as a food supply by native tribes, passing sailors, and early settlers. Hunting them was banned in 1939, but widespread poaching and habitat destruction caused the subspecies to plummet to near-extinction by the 1950s. The National Key Deer Refuge, a federally administered National Wildlife Refuge operated by the Wildlife Service, was established in 1967.\n\nRecent population estimates put the population between 700 and 800, putting it on the list of endangered species. Road kills from drivers on US 1, which traverses the deer's small range, are also a major threat, averaging between 125 and 150 kills per year, 70% of the annual mortality.\n\nHowever, the population has made an encouraging rise since 1955, when population estimates ranged as low as 25, and appears to have stabilized in recent years. Still, recent human encroachment into the fragile habitat and the deer's relatively low rate of reproduction point to an uncertain future for the subspecies.\n\nIn September 2016, a screw worm infestation was discovered (the first infestation of its kind in the U.S. since 1982) to be affecting the Key deer population, necessitating the euthanasia of affected animals. The screw worm is a fly larva that enters an open wound of a live animal and eats the flesh of the animal from within, leading to a gruesome death. The female fly mates once in her life, so the infestation can be battled by introducing sterile flies to the population, causing the females to die out without laying fertile eggs. Other steps to battle the outbreak included injecting deer with antiparasitic drugs, fencing off healthy sections of the population, and tracking a portion of deer with radio collars. The pest was declared as eradicated in April 2017. The outbreak killed 135 deer, roughly an eighth of the herd.\n\nConservation efforts include the establishment of the National Key Deer Refuge, which consists of about on Big Pine, No Name Key, and several smaller uninhabited islands. Not all of the refuge lands are protected as public lands; despite extensive efforts of the refuge to purchase these private habitat lands for protection in the refuge, about currently remain in private ownership and can potentially be developed. About of this privately developable land is on Big Pine Key and No Name Key, which are the central population areas for the deer.\nIn 2006, a habitat conservation plan was enacted by Monroe County and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which will limit development in primary habitat and provide for additional habitat purchases over the next 15 years. At the end of this period, however, most of the of privately owned habitat land on Big Pine and No Name Keys will still be open for further development. Thus, while the short term promises some cushion from extinction, the long-term prospects for the deer remain in doubt.\n\nA portion of US Route 1 was also elevated in 2003 to allow the deer to pass safely beneath the roadway, in an attempt to lessen the chance of road kills. However, no decrease in total traffic deaths has been seen.\n\nThe National Key Deer Refuge encourages people to help keep the Key deer wild by not feeding them. Feeding acclimates them to humans and vehicles, and makes them more likely to be hit and killed by vehicles. Also, hanging around people and developed areas in higher than normal densities makes them more susceptible to diseases, dog attacks, and entanglements in human trash, all of which can lead to increased injuries or death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2783063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2783063", "title": "Linguistic modality", "text": "Linguistic modality\n\nIn linguistics, modality is a feature of language that allows for communicating things about, or based on, situations which need not be actual. More precisely, modality is signaled by grammatical expressions (\"moods\") that express a speaker's general intentions (or illocutionary point) as well as the speaker's commitment to how believable, obligatory, desirable, or actual an expressed proposition is.\n\nSometimes, the term \"mood\" is used to refer to both mood and modality, however, the two can be distinguished according to whether they refer to the grammatical expressions of various modalities (\"mood\") or the meanings so expressed (\"modality\"). Modality can also be considered equivalent to the idea of \"illocutionary force\" if the kinds of expressions which can express modal meanings also include lexical items such as performative verbs.\n\nModality is closely intertwined with other linguistic phenomena such as tense and aspect, evidentiality, conditionals, and others. As with other areas of linguistics, modality has been studied extensively from typological as well as formal perspectives.\n\nAn important distinction within linguistic modality is the distinction between epistemic and deontic modality. Generally speaking, epistemic modality has to do with possibility and necessity with regard to knowledge, whereas deontic modality has to do with permission and obligation according to some system of rules. The difference between the two is illustrated in the English example below:\nThe sentence in (1) might be spoken by someone who has decided that all of the relevant facts in a particular murder investigation point to the conclusion that Agatha is the killer, even though it may or may not actually be the case. In contrast, (2) might be spoken by someone who has decided that, according to some standard of conduct, Agatha has committed a vile crime, and therefore the correct course of action is to kill Agatha. Note also that, although English \"must\" is ambiguous between these two interpretations, the form of the other elements in the sentences helps to disambiguate.\n\nIn standard formal approaches to linguistic modality, an utterance expressing modality is one that can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:\n\nThe set of propositions which forms the basis of evaluation is called the modal base. The result of the evaluation is called the modal force.\nFor example the utterance in (2) expresses that, according to what the speaker has observed, it is necessary to conclude that John has a rather high income:\n\nThe modal base here is the knowledge of the speaker, the modal force is necessity. By contrast, (3) could be paraphrased as ‘Given his abilities, the strength of his teeth, etc., it is possible for John to open a beer bottle with his teeth’. Here, the modal base is defined by a subset of John's abilities, the modal force is possibility.\n\nA more elaborate account of formal semantic approaches to modality is given in section 1.\n\nCross-linguistically, modality can be expressed by a variety of means, such as auxiliary verbs as in the examples (2) and (3), verbal morphology (mood) or adverbs. An overview of the various modal expressions across languages is given below in section 2.\n\nTypological approaches to modality usually favour a slightly wider definition of modality and also include meanings which do not fit the template in (1) exactly. Section 3 provides an overview over the range of meanings commonly associated with modality.\n\nSemantic approaches dealing with modality are traditionally based on the principles of modal logic. Both work with the notion that propositions can be mapped to sets of possible worlds, that is, a proposition can be defined as the set of worlds in which that proposition is true. For example, the proposition ‘the earth is flat’ corresponds to the set of possible worlds in which the earth is in fact flat.\n\nIn this framework, modal expressions such as \"must\" and \"can\" are then analyzed as quantifiers over a set of possible worlds. This set of worlds is given by the modal base and is said to be \"the set of accessible worlds\": For example, in sentence (2) above, the modal base is the knowledge the speaker has in the actual world. Therefore, the set of accessible worlds is defined by the information the speaker has about John. Assume for example that the speaker knows that John just bought a new luxury car and has rented a huge apartment. The speaker also knows that John is an honest person with a humble family background and doesn't play the lottery.\nThe set of accessible worlds is then the set of worlds in which all these propositions which the speaker knows about John are true.\n\nThe notions of necessity and possibility are then defined along the following lines: A proposition \"p\" follows necessarily from the set of accessible worlds, if all accessible worlds are part of \"p\" (that is, if \"p\" is true in all of these worlds). Applied to the example in (2) this would mean that in all the worlds which are defined by the speaker's knowledge about John, it is the case that John earns a lot of money (assuming there is no other explanation for John's wealth).\n\nIn a similar way a proposition \"p\" is possible according to the set of accessible worlds (i.e. the modal base), if some of these worlds are part of \"p\".\n\nFor further reading, see for example Kratzer 1991, Kaufmann et al. 2006 and Portner 2009.\n\nIn many languages modal categories are expressed by verbal morphology. If these verbal markers of modality are obligatory in a language, they are called \"mood\" markers. Well-known examples of moods in some European languages are referred to as subjunctive, conditional and indicative as illustrated below with examples from French, all three with the verb \"avoir\" ‘to have’. As in most Standard European languages, the shape of the verb conveys not only information about modality, but also about other categories such as person and number of the subject.\n\nAn example for a non-European language with a similar encoding of modality is Manam. Here, a verb is prefixed by a morpheme which encodes number and person of the subject. These prefixes come in two versions, one \"realis\" version and one \"irrealis\" version. Which one is chosen depends on whether the verb refers to an actual past or present event (realis), or merely to a possible or imagined event (irrealis) (see Elliott 2000).\n\nModal auxiliary verbs, such as the English words \"may, can, must, ought, will, shall, need, dare, might, could, would,\" and \"should\", are often used to express modality, especially in the Germanic languages.\n\nVerbs such as \"want\" can be used to express modality lexically, as can adverbs.\n\nComplementizers (e.g. Russian) and conjunctions (e.g. Central Pomo, see Mithun 1995) can be used to convey modality.\n\nMany different kinds of modal interpretations have been observed and studied, resulting in a variety of typologies. What follows below is one of the many ways that modality has been classified. Only broad categories have been distinguished below: the reader is referred to the main articles and the references for more detailed discussions.\n\nThe closely related realis, declarative, and evidential moods refer to situations that actually exist, are claimed to exist, or are inferred to exist. In contrast, irrealis moods refer to situations that are not known to exist. Two common irrealis moods are the conditional mood, stating what would happen under a certain condition or conditions (expressed periphrastically in English as \"would\" + main verb), and the subjunctive mood, stating the speaker's preferences for what should occur (such as \"he leave\" in the English \"I demand that he leave\") or hypotheticals (such as English \"If I were to go...\").\n\nCounterfactuals refer to things that are contrary to the actual situation. In English, counterfactuals can be expressed implicitly in \"if\"-clauses by using a tense form that normally refers to a time prior to the time actually semantically referred to in the \"if\"-clause. For example, \"If I knew that, I wouldn't have to ask\" contains the counterfactual \"If I knew\", which refers to the present tense despite the form of the verb, and which denies the proposition \"I know that\". This contrasts with the construction \"If I know that...\", which is not a counterfactual because it means that maybe I know it and maybe I don't (or maybe I will know it, and maybe I will not). Likewise, \"If I had known that, I would have gone there\" contains the counterfactual \"If I had known\", denying the proposition that I had known; a note of caution on the above: the pluperfect verbal construction is sometimes mistakenly confused with the simple past, this is because most of the time the distinction has a very small effect on the semantic interpretation, and the incorrect logic that, through inertia, prior knowledge of X implies present knowledge of X, however this is not universal, (e.g. memory loss), a correct modal statement would look like \"prior knowledge of X \"usually\" implies present knowledge of X\". as with any subtlety, caution is prescribed.\n\nEpistemic modals are used to indicate the possibility or necessity of some piece of knowledge. It deals with the likelihood of the actualization of the state of affairs. In the epistemic use, modals can be interpreted as indicating inference or some other process of reasoning involved in coming to the conclusion stated in the sentence containing the modal. However, epistemic modals do not necessarily require inference, reasoning, or evidence. One effect of using an epistemic modal (as opposed to not using one) is a general weakening of the speaker's commitment to the truth of the sentence containing the modal. However, it is disputed whether the function of modals is to indicate this weakening of commitment, or whether the weakening is a by-product of some other aspect of the modal's meaning.\n\nExamples of the expression of epistemic modality in English are: \"he might be there\" (low probability, substantial doubt), \"He may be there\" (possibility), \"He should be there by now\" (high probability), and \"He must be there by now\" (certitude, no doubt).\n\nIn contrast, deontic modality is concerned with possibility and necessity in terms of freedom to act (including ability, permission, and duty). In other words, deontic modals state something about the desirability of the actualization of the state of affairs, expressed in varying degrees of obligation. English examples include \"She can go\" (ability), \"You may go\" (permission), \"You should go\" (request), and \"You must go\" (command). In English as in many other languages, some of the same words are used for deontic modality as for epistemic modality, and the meaning is distinguished from context: \"He must be there by now\" (epistemic) versus \"He must be there tomorrow at noon\" (deontic).\n\n\n"}

It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum. The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is James Hanken, the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.\n\nMany of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a fossil sand dollar which was found by Charles Darwin in 1834, Captain Cook's mamo, and two pheasants that once belonged to George Washington, now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.\n\nThe Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.\n\nThe Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist Louis Agassiz, and the museum used to be referred to as \"The Agassiz\" after its founder. Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and comparative relationships of animal life.\n\nThe Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory was created in 1894 when Radcliffe College rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.\n\nThe museum comprises twelve departments: Biological Oceanography, Entomology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Mammalogy, Marine invertebrates, Malacology, Ornithology, Population Genetics, and Vertebrate Paleontology. The Ernst Mayr Library and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum. The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the Biodiversity Heritage Library.\n\nThe museum publishes two journals: the \"Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College\", first published in 1869, and \"Breviora\", first published in 1956.\n\nIn contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of stuffed animals on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Notable exhibits include whale skeletons, the largest turtle shell ever found (eight feet long), \"the Harvard mastodon\", a long \"Kronosaurus\" skeleton, the skeleton of a dodo, and a coelacanth preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.\n\nNew and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include \"Evolution\" (2008); \"The Language of Color\" (2008 to 2013); \"Arthropods: Creatures that Rule\" (2006); \"New England Forests\" (2011); and \"Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm\" (2012).\n\n"}

{"id": "23898659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23898659", "title": "Oceanic feeling", "text": "Oceanic feeling\n\nIn a 1927 letter to Sigmund Freud, Romain Rolland coined the phrase \"oceanic feeling\" to refer to the sensation of being one with the universe. According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion. Freud discusses the feeling in his \"Future of an Illusion\" (1927) and \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.\n\nOn December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a letter to Freud:\n\nIn strict translation:\n\nFreud ends \"The Future of an Illusion\" with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of \"Civilization and Its Discontents\", answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.\n\nFreud argues that the \"oceanic feeling\", if it exists, is the preserved \"primitive ego-feeling\" from infancy. The primitive ego-feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it. Therefore, the infant has no concept of a \"self\" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist. Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the \"oceanic feeling\" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.\n\n\"Neurotheology\" is a neologism that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices. Other researchers have rejected the term, preferring to use terms like \"spiritual neuroscience\" or \"neuroscience of religion\". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as: the perception that time, fear or self-consciousness have dissolved; spiritual awe; oneness with the universe; ecstatic trance; sudden enlightenment; and altered states of consciousness.\n\nWhat Andrew B. Newberg and others \"discovered is that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call \"oneness with the universe\".\"\n\n"}

Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm \"last resort\", condemning both aggression and militarism. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.\n\nThe distinct theory was first put forward by A. J. P. Taylor in \"The Trouble-Makers\" (1957) and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, \"Thinking About Peace and War\". It was also discussed in detail in Richard Norman's book: \"Ethics, Killing and War\".\n\nThe largest national peace association in history, the British League of Nations Union, was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.

{"id": "24515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24515", "title": "Paranoia", "text": "Paranoia\n\nParanoia is an instinct or thought process believed to be heavily influenced by anxiety or fear, often to the point of delusion and irrationality. Paranoid thinking typically includes persecutory, or beliefs of conspiracy concerning a perceived threat towards oneself (e.g. the American colloquial phrase, \"Everyone is out to get me\"). Paranoia is distinct from phobias, which also involve irrational fear, but usually no blame. Making false accusations and the general distrust of others also frequently accompany paranoia. For example, an incident most people would view as an accident or coincidence, a paranoid person might believe was intentional. Paranoia is a central symptom of psychosis.\n\nA popular symptom of paranoia is the attribution bias. These individuals typically have a biased perception of reality, often exhibiting more hostile beliefs. A paranoid person may view someone else's accidental behavior as though it is with intent or threatening.\n\nAn investigation of a non-clinical paranoid population found that feeling powerless and depressed, isolating oneself, and relinquishing activities are characteristics that could be associated with those exhibiting more frequent paranoia.\nSome scientists have created different subtypes for the various symptoms of paranoia including erotic, persecutory, litigious, and exalted.\n\nDue to the suspicious and troublesome personality traits of paranoia, it is unlikely that someone with paranoia will thrive in interpersonal relationships. Most commonly paranoid individuals tend to be of a single status. According to some research there is a hierarchy for paranoia. The least common types of paranoia at the very top of the hierarchy would be those involving more serious threats. Social anxiety is at the bottom of this hierarchy as the most frequently exhibited level of paranoia.\n\nSocial circumstances appear to be highly influential on paranoid beliefs. Based on data collected by means of a mental health survey distributed to residents of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua (in Mexico) and El Paso, Texas (in the United States), paranoid beliefs seem to be associated with feelings of powerlessness and victimization, enhanced by social situations. Potential causes of these effects included a sense of believing in external control, and mistrust which can be strengthened by lower socioeconomic status. Those living in a lower socioeconomic status may feel less in control of their own lives. In addition, this study explains that females have the tendency to believe in external control at a higher rate than males, potentially making females more susceptible to mistrust and the effects of socioeconomic status on paranoia.\n\nEmanuel Messinger reports that surveys have revealed that those exhibiting paranoia can evolve from parental relationships and untrustworthy environments. These environments could include being very disciplinary, stringent, and unstable. It was even noted that, \"indulging and pampering (thereby impressing the child that he is something special and warrants special privileges),\" can be contributing backgrounds. Experiences likely to enhance or manifest the symptoms of paranoia include increased rates of disappointment, stress, and a hopeless state of mind.\n\nDiscrimination has also been reported as a potential predictor of paranoid delusions. Such reports that paranoia seemed to appear more in older patients who had experienced higher levels of discrimination throughout their lives. In addition to this it has been noted that immigrants are quite susceptible to forms of psychosis. This could be due to the aforementioned effects of discriminatory events and humiliation.\n\nWhile many more mood-based symptoms, grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia.\n\nColby (1981) defined \"paranoid cognition\" in terms of \"persecutory delusions and false beliefs whose propositional content clusters around ideas of being harassed, threatened, harmed, subjugated, persecuted, accused, mistreated, wronged, tormented, disparaged, vilified, and so on, by malevolent others, either specific individuals or groups\" (p. 518).\nThree components of paranoid cognition have been identified by Robins & Post: \"a) suspicions without enough basis that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them; b) preoccupation with unjustified doubts about the loyalty, or trustworthiness, of friends or associates; c) reluctance to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them\" (1997, p. 3).\n\nParanoid cognition has been conceptualized by clinical psychology almost exclusively in terms of psychodynamic constructs and dispositional variables. From this point of view, paranoid cognition is a manifestation of an intra-psychic conflict or disturbance. For instance, Colby (1981) suggested that the biases of blaming others for one’s problems serve to alleviate the distress produced by the feeling of being humiliated, and helps to repudiate the belief that the self is to blame for such incompetence. This intra-psychic perspective emphasize that the cause of paranoid cognitions are inside the head of the people (social perceiver), and dismiss the fact that paranoid cognition may be related with the social context in which such cognitions are embedded. This point is extremely relevant because when origins of distrust and suspicion (two components of paranoid cognition) are studied many researchers have accentuated the importance of social interaction, particularly when social interaction has gone awry. Even more, a model of trust development pointed out that trust increases or decreases as a function of the cumulative history of interaction between two or more persons.\n\nAnother relevant difference can be discerned among \"pathological and non-pathological forms of trust and distrust\". According to Deutsch, the main difference is that non-pathological forms are flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. Pathological forms reflect exaggerated perceptual biases and judgmental predispositions that can arise and perpetuate them, are reflexively caused errors similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIt has been suggested that a \"hierarchy\" of paranoia exists, extending from mild social evaluative concerns, through ideas of social reference, to persecutory beliefs concerning mild, moderate, and severe threats.\n\nA paranoid reaction may be caused from a decline in brain circulation as a result of high blood pressure or hardening of the arterial walls.\n\nDrug-induced paranoia, associated with amphetamines, methamphetamine and similar stimulants has much in common with schizophrenic paranoia; the relationship has been under investigation since 2012. Drug-induced paranoia has a better prognosis than schizophrenic paranoia once the drug has been removed. For further information, see stimulant psychosis and substance-induced psychosis.\n\nDuring the 1960s with the increase of the use of marijuana, LSD, and other drugs in places like California, paranoia began to set in with many individuals. Some thought that because there was illegality in the use of the drugs – the fear of police catching the individuals was bothering them. Professionals felt, however, that those drugs brought on paranoia. \n\nBased on data obtained by the Dutch NEMISIS project in 2005, there was an association between impaired hearing and the onset of symptoms of psychosis, which was based on a five-year follow up. Some older studies have actually declared that a state of paranoia can be produced in patients that were under a hypnotic state of deafness. This idea however generated much skepticism during its time.\n\nIn the DSM-IV-TR, paranoia is diagnosed in the form of:\nPersecutory type does not exist. This is a false information. In 2015 year the persecutory type was not considered, there it was no information online about such classification.\n\nAccording to clinical psychologist P. J. McKenna, \"As a noun, paranoia denotes a disorder which has been argued in and out of existence, and whose clinical features, course, boundaries, and virtually every other aspect of which is controversial. Employed as an adjective, paranoid has become attached to a diverse set of presentations, from paranoid schizophrenia, through paranoid depression, to paranoid personality—not to mention a motley collection of paranoid 'psychoses', 'reactions', and 'states'—and this is to restrict discussion to functional disorders. Even when abbreviated down to the prefix para-, the term crops up causing trouble as the contentious but stubbornly persistent concept of paraphrenia\".\n\nAt least 50% of the diagnosed cases of schizophrenia experience delusions of reference and delusions of persecution. Paranoia perceptions and behavior may be part of many mental illnesses, such as depression and dementia, but they are more prevalent in three mental disorders: paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder (persecutory type), and paranoid personality disorder.\n\nThe word \"paranoia\" comes from the Greek παράνοια (\"paranoia\"), \"madness\", and that from παρά (\"para\"), \"beside, by\" and νόος (\"noos\"), \"mind\". However, the history of the term is not the history of the concept, let alone the mental condition currently considered as a disease. Indeed, the historiography of ‘paranoia’ is complicated and must be approached with care. The term was used to describe a mental illness in which a delusional belief is the sole or most prominent feature. In this definition, the belief does not have to be persecutory to be classified as paranoid, so any number of delusional beliefs can be classified as paranoia. For example, a person who has the sole delusional belief that they are an important religious figure would be classified by Kraepelin as having 'pure paranoia'.\n\nAccording to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000), paranoia and paraphrenia are debated entities that were detached from dementia praecox by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia as a continuous systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, paraphrenia as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves.\n\nIt has generally been agreed upon that individuals with paranoid delusions will have the tendency to take action based on their beliefs. More research is needed on the particular types of actions that are pursued based on paranoid delusions. Some researchers have made attempts to distinguish the different variations of actions brought on as a result of delusions. Wessely et al. (1993) did just this by studying individuals with delusions of which more than half had reportedly taken action or behaved as a result of these delusions. However, the overall actions were not of a violent nature in most of the informants. The authors note that other studies such as one by Taylor (1985), have shown that violent behaviors were more common in certain types of paranoid individuals, mainly those considered to be offensive such as prisoners.\n\nOther researchers have found associations between childhood abusive behaviors and the appearance of violent behaviors in psychotic individuals. This could be a result of their inability to cope with aggression as well as other people, especially when constantly attending to potential threats in their environment. The attention to threat itself has been proposed as one of the major contributors of violent actions in paranoid people, although there has been much deliberation about this as well. Other studies have shown that there may only be certain types of delusions that promote any violent behaviors, persecutory delusions seem to be one of these.\n\nHaving resentful emotions towards others and the inability to be able to understand what other people are feeling seem to have an association with violence in paranoid individuals. This was based on a study of paranoid schizophrenics' (one of the common mental disorders that exhibit paranoid symptoms) theories of mind capabilities in relation to empathy. The results of this study revealed specifically that although the violent patients were more successful at the higher level theory of mind tasks, they were not as able to interpret others' emotions or claims.\n\nSocial psychological research has proposed a mild form of paranoid cognition, \"paranoid social cognition\", that has its origins in social determinants more than intra-psychic conflict. This perspective states that in milder forms, paranoid cognitions may be very common among normal individuals. For instance, it is not strange that people may exhibit in their daily life, self-centered thought such as they are being talked about, suspiciousness about other’ intentions, and assumptions of ill or hostility (i.e. people may feel as if everything is going against them). According to Kramer, (1998) these milder forms of paranoid cognition may be considered as an adaptive response to cope with or make sense of disturbing and threatening social environment.\n\nParanoid cognition captures the idea that dysphoric self-consciousness may be related with the position that people occupies within a social system. This self-consciousness conduces to a hypervigilant and ruminative mode to process social information that finally will stimulate a variety of paranoid-like forms of social misperception and misjudgment. This model identifies four components that are essential to understanding paranoid social cognition: situational antecedents, dysphoric self-consciousness, hypervigilance and rumination, and judgmental biases.\n\nPerceived social distinctiveness, perceived evaluative scrutiny and uncertainty about the social standing.\n\nRefers to an aversive form of heightened 'public self-consciousness' characterized by the feelings that one is under intensive evaluation or scrutiny. Becoming self-tormenting will increase the odds of interpreting others' behaviors in a self-referential way.\n\nSelf-consciousness was characterized as an aversive psychological state. According to this model, people experiencing self-consciousness will be highly motivated to reduce it, trying to make sense of what they are experiencing. These attempts promote hypervigilance and rumination in a circular relationship: more hypervigilance generates more rumination, whereupon more rumination generates more hypervigilance. Hypervigilance can be thought of as a way to appraise threatening social information, but in contrast to adaptive vigilance, hypervigilance will produce elevated levels of arousal, fear, anxiety, and threat perception. Rumination is another possible response to threatening social information. Rumination can be related to the paranoid social cognition because it can increase negative thinking about negative events, and evoke a pessimistic explanatory style.\n\nThree main judgmental consequences have been identified:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24537", "title": "Pen pal", "text": "Pen pal\n\nPen pals (or penpals, pen-pals, penfriends or pen friends) are people who regularly write to each other, particularly via postal mail.\n\nA penpal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a foreign language, to improve literacy, to learn more about other countries and life-styles, and to make friendships. As with any friendships in life, some people remain penpals for only a short time, while others continue to exchange letters and presents for life. Some penpals eventually arrange to meet face to face; sometimes leading to serious relationships, or even marriage.\n\nPenpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. Pals may seek new penfriends based on their own age group, a specific occupation, hobby, or select someone totally different from them to gain knowledge about the world around them.\n\nA modern variation on the traditional penpal arrangement is to have a keypal / epal and exchange email addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged in a short period of time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox. Using postal mail, it is possible to trade coupons, swap slips, postcards, stamps and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called \"tuck-ins\". Many penpallers like to trade sheets of stickers, notecards and stationery sets.\n\nWhile the expansion of the Internet has reduced the number of traditional penpals, penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term \"pen pals\" defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more. Penpals also make and pass around friendship books, slams and crams. Another term used to describe pen pal is the word penfriend.\n\nIn recent years, pen pal correspondence with prison inmates has gained acceptance on the Internet.\n\nMany penpals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.\n\nOrganizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.\n\nWhile the traditional snail mail pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's communication gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow prisoners to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the United States and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.\n\nThe Australian author Geraldine Brooks wrote a memoir entitled \"Foreign Correspondence\" (1997) about her childhood, which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.\n\nIn the 1970s, syndicated children's television program \"Big Blue Marble\" often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.\n\nOn another children's TV show, \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\", Pee-wee Herman would often receive pen pal letters.\n\nAt the 1964/1965 World's Fair in New York, the Parker Pen pavilion provided a computer pen pal matching service. This service was officially terminated by Parker Pen in 1967. This service did not work in conjunction with any other pen friend clubs. The computer system and database used for this service were not sold, taken over, or continued in any way.\n\nIn the \"Peanuts\" comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen but after several literally \"botched\" attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his \"pencil-pal\", with his first letter to his \"pencil-pal\" explaining the reason for the name change.\n\nThe 1983 Bollywood film \"Romance\" is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals.

{"id": "34947960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34947960", "title": "Personality judgment", "text": "Personality judgment\n\nPersonality judgment (or personality judgement) is the process by which people perceive each other's personalities through acquisition of certain information about others, or meeting others in person. The purpose of studying personality judgment is to understand past behavior exhibited by individuals and predict future behavior. Theories concerning personality judgment focus on the accuracy of personality judgments and the effects of personality judgments on various aspects of social interactions. Determining how people judge personality is important because personality judgments often influence individuals' behaviors.\n\nResearch on the accuracy of personality judgments varies based on three major perspectives on the basis of accurate personality judgment. These perspectives vary based on the criteria used to determine accuracy.\n\nA variety of variables contribute to the accuracy or inaccuracy of personality judgment in systematic ways. These variables include characteristics of the individual whose personality is being judged as well as characteristics of the individual who is judging personality.\n\nCharacteristics of the individual judging personality that contribute to accuracy include the following:\n\nCharacteristics of the target individual that are important for accurate personality judgment include the following:\n\nPersonality judgment not only influences perceptions of individuals, it also may influence the behavior of individuals being judged. This phenomenon is known as behavioral confirmation, and occurs when one's preconceived ideas about a person influence the behavior of the person. For example, if an individual is believed to be aggressive, one's behavior toward that individual may elicit an aggressive response, even if the individual is not typically aggressive. Behavioral confirmation may occur in a variety of settings, including classrooms and social interactions. Researchers have shown that when a male individual believes he is talking to an attractive woman over the phone, the woman will act more sociable and agreeable than if the male believes he is talking to an unattractive woman. This suggests that the woman's behavior in this situation is being influenced by the male's expectations concerning her appearance, rather than her actual personality characteristics.\n\nAn additional determinant of the processes through which personality is judged and the accuracy of these judgments is culture. Typically, researchers report cross-cultural consistency in the judgment of personality. However, people from different types of cultures tend to find certain traits more easily identifiable than others, based on judging personality from facial characteristics of targets alone. For example, people from Western cultures are typically better able to identify the traits of extroversion and aggression than individuals from Eastern cultures.\n"}
{"id": "2009709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009709", "title": "Posting rule", "text": "Posting rule\n\nThe posting rule (or mailbox rule in the United States, also known as the \"postal rule\" or \"deposited acceptance rule\") is an exception to the general rule of contract law in common law countries that acceptance of an offer takes place when communicated. Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a post box or handed to a postal worker). In plain English, the \"meeting of the minds\" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is \"sent\" via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is \"received\" by the person who offered the contract.\n\nThe rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following:\n\nOne rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer.\n\nThe rule was established by a series of 19th century cases, starting with \"Adams v Lindsell\" (1818) B & Ald 681, which was later confirmed and expanded in \"Dunlop v Higgins\" (1848) 1 HL Cas 381, \"Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant\" (1879) 4 Ex D 216 and \"Henthorn v Fraser\" [1892] 2 Ch 27.\n\nThe posting rule applies only to acceptance. Other contractual letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in \"Stevenson, Jacques & Co v McLean\" (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication of this is that it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter of revocation of the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete at the time that the letter of acceptance was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.\n\nExample 1:\n\nExample 2:\n\nExample 3:\n\nUnder the posting rule, performance is a means of acceptance. If A orders 1000 blue coathangers and B ships them out, that shipment is considered to be a conveyance of acceptance of A's offer to buy the coathangers. Defective performance is also an acceptance, unless accompanied by an explanation. For example, if A orders 1000 blue coathangers, and B mistakenly ships 1000 red coathangers, this is still an acceptance of the contract. However, if B ships the red coathangers with a note that they sent these because they had run out of blue coathangers, this is not an acceptance, but rather an accommodation, which is a form of counter-offer.\n\nAn interesting implication of the operation of the posting rule is that an acceptance is complete once the letter of acceptance is posted; it makes no difference whether the offeror actually receives the letter. This was demonstrated in \"Byrne v Van Tienhoven\" (1880) 5 CPD 344. If a letter of acceptance were to be lost, acceptance has still taken place. An exception to this would be if the offeree knows or has reason to know that the letter of acceptance never reached the offeror. For example, if A brings a letter of acceptance to the local post office and A sees the post office burn down a moment later, there is no acceptance.\n\nFurther the posting rule does not apply to instantaneous forms of communications. For example, in \"Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation\" [1955] 2 QB 327, the Court held that the posting rule did not apply to an acceptance by telex as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting rule does apply to acceptances by telephone or fax. \n\nThe courts are yet to decide whether e-mail should be regarded as an instantaneous form of communication. If the offeree were to convey acceptance by commercially \"un\"reasonable means - by cross-country pony express, for example - the acceptance would not be effective until it had actually been received.\n\nA letter is regarded as \"posted\" only when it is in the possession of the Post Office; this was established in the case of \"Re London & Northern Bank\" [1900] 1 Ch 220. A letter of acceptance is not considered \"posted\" if it is handed to an agent to deliver, such as a courier. This is not the case under the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe posting rule does not apply to option contracts or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed revocations of the offer.\nWhere parties are at distance from one another, and an offer is sent by mail, it is universally held in this country [United States] that the reply accepting the offer may be sent through the same medium, and, if it is so sent, the contract will be complete when the acceptance is mailed...and beyond the acceptor's control; the theory being that, when one makes an offer through the mail, he authorizes the acceptance to be made through the same medium his agent to receive his acceptance; that the acceptance, when mailed, is then constructively communicated to the offeror.\n\n–Excerpt of an opinion by Judge Kimmelman (718 A.2d 1223)\n\nIn the United States, the majority rule is that the mailbox rule does not apply to option contracts. By default, an option contract is accepted when the offeror receives the acceptance, not when the offeree mails it. However, because the California Civil Code applies the mailbox rule to all contracts, California follows the minority rule, under which the mailbox rule also applies to option contracts.\n\nIn \"Tallerman & Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise\" (1957) 98 CLR 93, 111-112 Dixon CJ and Fullagar J took a more restrictive view. \"The general rule is that a contract is not completed until acceptance of an offer is actually communicated to the offeror, and a finding that a contract is completed by the posting of a letter of acceptance cannot be justified unless it is to be inferred that the offeror contemplated and intended that his offer might be accepted by the doing of that act.\" The High Court included the element of intention.\n\nCivil law jurisdictions do not follow the postal rule. The classical civil law position is that acceptance, like any expression of will, can only be effective if it was communicated to the addressee, unless the lack of communication can be attributed to the latter. The Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods chooses a compromise between the two approaches: According to article 18(2) of the Convention, an acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeror. However, article 16(1) of the Convention provides for the most important consequence of the common law \"posting rule\", that is, an offer may not be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree after it has dispatched an acceptance.\n\nMany countries have enacted legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce. Such legislation is often entitled the Electronic Transactions Act. Among other issues, this legislation deals a default rule for the time that email (electronic communications) is sent and when it is received. However it is mistaken to suggest that it deals with a clarification of the postal acceptance rule for electronic communications. There are two schools of thought.\n\n\nThe UNCITRAL rules on time of sending and receiving are:\n\n\n\n"}

For example, the PDM indicates that the anxiety disorders may be traced to the \"four basic danger situations\" described by Sigmund Freud (1926) as the loss of a significant other; the loss of love; the loss of body integrity; and the loss of affirmation by one's own conscience. It uses a new perspective on the existing diagnostic system as it enables clinicians to describe and categorize personality patterns, related social and emotional capacities, unique mental profiles, and personal experiences of the patient.\n\nThe PDM is not intended to compete with the DSM or ICD. The authors report the work emphasizes \"individual variations as well as commonalities\" by \"focusing on the full range of mental functioning\" and serves as a \"[complement to] the DSM and ICD efforts in cataloguing [sic] symptoms. The task force intends for the PDM to augment the existing diagnostic taxonomies by providing \"a multi dimensional approach to describe the intricacies of the patient's overall functioning and ways of engaging in the therapeutic process.\".\n\nThis first dimension classifies personality patterns in two domains. First, it looks at the spectrum of personality types and places the person's personality on a continuum from unhealthy and maladaptive to healthy and adaptive. Second, it classifies the how the person \"organizes mental functioning and engages the world\".\n\nThe task force adds, \"This dimension has been placed first in the PDM system because of the accumulating evidence that symptoms or problems cannot be understood, assessed, or treated in the absence of an understanding of the mental life of the person who has the symptoms\". In other words, a list of symptoms characteristic of a diagnosis does not adequately inform a clinician how to understand and treat the symptoms without proper context. By analogy, if a patient went to her physician complaining of watering eyes and a runny nose, the symptoms alone do not indicate the appropriate treatment. Her symptoms could be a function of seasonal allergies, a bacterial sinus infection, the common cold, or she may have just come from her grandmother's funeral. The doctor might treat allergies with an antihisamine, the sinus infection with antibiotics, the cold with zinc, and give her patient a Kleenex tissue after the funeral. All four conditions may have very similar symptoms; all four condition are treated very differently.\n\nNext, the PDM provides a \"detailed description of emotional functioning\" which are understood to be \"the capacities that contribute to an individual's personality and overall level of psychological health or pathology\". This dimension provides a \"microscopic\" examination of the patient's mental life by systematically accounting for their functional capacity to\n\nThe third dimension starts with the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic categories; moreover, beyond simply listing symptoms, the PDM \"goes on to describe the affective states, cognitive processes, somatic experiences, and relational patterns most often associated clinically\" with each diagnosis. In this dimension, \"symptom clusters\" are \"useful descriptors\" which presents the patient's \"symptom patterns in terms of the patient's personal experience of his or her prevailing difficulties\". The task force concludes, \"The patient may evidence a few or many patterns, which may or may not be related, and which should be seen in the context of the person's personality and mental functioning. The multi dimensional approach... provides a systematic way to describe patients that is faithful to their complexity and helpful in planning appropriate treatments\".\n\nGuilford Press will be publishing a new edition of the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM-2), which is being developed by a steering committee composed by Vittorio Lingiardi (Editor), Nancy McWilliams (Editor), and Robert S. Wallerstein (Honorary Chair). Guilford Press received a manuscript for PDM-2 in September 2016, and the current release date is set for June 2017.\n\n\n"}

Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz entitled her book \"The Superwoman Syndrome\" in 1984.\n\nThe notion was first recognized in the post second-wave feminism American society of 1970s–1980s, with the shift of the woman's traditional role of a housewife towards a more career-oriented way of life.

{"id": "10325000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10325000", "title": "Unity of opposites", "text": "Unity of opposites\n\nThe unity of opposites is the central category of dialectics, said to be related to the notion of non-duality in a deep sense. It defines a situation in which the existence or identity of a thing (or situation) depends on the co-existence of at least two conditions which are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other, within a field of tension. \n\nFirst suggested by Heraclitus (c. 535 – c. 475 BC), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, philosophers had for some time been contemplating the notion of opposites. Anaximander posited that every element was an opposite, or connected to an opposite (water is cold, fire is hot). Thus, the material world was composed by some indefinite, boundless apeiron from which arose the elements (earth, air, fire, water) and pairs of opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry). There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites.\n\nAnaximenes of Miletus, a student and successor of Anaximander, replaced this indefinite, boundless arche with air, a known element with neutral properties. According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change.\n\nHeraclitus, however, did not accept the milesian monism and replaced their underlying material arche with a single, divine law of the universe, which he called Logos. The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, but also remaining the same. That is to say, an object moves from point A to point B, thus creating a change, but the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe as difference and sameness. This is a rather broad example though. For a more detailed example we may turn to an aphorism of Heraclitus:\n\nThe road up and the road down are the same thing. (Hippolytus, \"Refutations\" 9.10.3)\n\nThis is an example of a compresent unity of opposites. For, at the same time, this slanted road has the opposite qualities of ascent and descent. According to Heraclitus, everything is in constant flux, and every changing object co-instantiates at least one pair of opposites (though not necessarily simultaneously) and every pair of opposites is co-instantiated in at least one object. \n\nHeraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a base for change:\n\nCold things grow hot, a hot thing cold, a moist thing withers, a parched thing is wetted. (DK B126)\n\nAs a single object persists through opposite properties, this object undergoes change.\n\nDialecticians claim that unity or identity of opposites can exist in reality or in thought. If the opposites were completely balanced, the result would be stasis, but often it is implied that one of the pairs of opposites is larger, stronger or more powerful than the other, such that over time, one of the opposed conditions prevails over the other. Yet rather than 'stasis' the identity of opposites, there being unity within their duality, is taken to be the instance of their very manifestation, the unity between them being the essential principle of making any particular opposite in question extant as either opposing force. For example 'upward' cannot exist unless there is a 'downward', they are opposites but they co-substantiate one another, their unity is that either one exists because the opposite is necessary for the existence of the other, one manifests immediately with the other. Hot would not be hot without cold, due to there being no contrast by which to define it as 'hot' relative to any other condition, it would not and could not have identity whatsoever if not for its very opposite that makes the necessary prerequisite existence for the opposing condition to be. This is the oneness, unity, principle to the very existence of any opposite. Either one's identity is the contra-posing principle itself, necessitating the other. The criteria for what is opposite is therefore something \"a priori\". \n\nIn his criticism of Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel who tried to systematise dialectical understandings thus wrote: \n\nIn his philosophy, Hegel ventured to describe quite a few cases of \"unity of opposites\", including the concepts of Finite and Infinite, Force and Matter, Identity and Difference, Positive and Negative, Form and Content, Chance and Necessity, Cause and effect, Freedom and Necessity, Subjectivity and Objectivity, Means and Ends, Subject and Object, and Abstract and Concrete. It is also considered to be integral to Marxist philosophy of nature and is discussed in Friedrich Engels' \"Dialectics of Nature\".\n\n\"Coincidentia oppositorum\" is a Latin phrase meaning coincidence of opposites. It is a neoplatonic term attributed to 15th century German polymath Nicholas of Cusa in his essay, \"De Docta Ignorantia\" (1440). Mircea Eliade, a 20th-century historian of religion, used the term extensively in his essays about myth and ritual, describing the \"coincidentia oppositorum\" as \"the mythical pattern\". Psychiatrist Carl Jung, the philosopher and Islamic Studies professor Henry Corbin as well as Jewish philosophers Gershom Scholem and Abraham Joshua Heschel also used the term. \nIn alchemy, \"coincidentia oppositorum\" is a synonym for \"coniunctio\". For example, Michael Maier stresses that the union of opposites is the aim of the alchemical work. Or, according to Paracelsus' pupil, Gerhard Dorn, the highest grade of the alchemical \"coniunctio\" consisted in the union of the total man with the \"unus mundus\" (\"one world\"). \n\nThe term is also used in describing a revelation of the oneness of things previously believed to be different. Such insight into the unity of things is a kind of transcendence, and is found in various mystical traditions. The idea occurs in the traditions of Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, in German mysticism, Taoism, Zen and Sufism, among others.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "338331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338331", "title": "Value (computer science)", "text": "Value (computer science)\n\nIn computer science, a value is the representation of some entity that can be manipulated by a program. The members of a type are the values of that type. \n\nThe \"value of a variable\" is given by the corresponding mapping in the environment. In languages with assignable variables it becomes necessary to distinguish between the \"r-value\" (or contents) and the \"l-value\" (or location) of a variable.\n\nIn declarative (high-level) languages, values have to be referentially transparent. This means that the resulting value is independent of the location in which a (sub-)expression needed to compute the value is stored. Only the contents of the location (the bits, whether they are 1 or 0) and their interpretation are significant.\n\nSome languages use the idea of l-values and r-values, deriving from the typical mode of evaluation on the left and right hand side of an assignment statement. An lvalue refers to an object that persists beyond a single expression. An rvalue is a temporary value that does not persist beyond the expression that uses it.\n\nThe notion of l-values and r-values was introduced by Combined Programming Language (CPL). The notions in an expression of r-value, l-value, and r-value/l-value are analogous to the parameter modes of input parameter (has a value), output parameter (can be assigned), and input/output parameter (has a value and can be assigned), though the technical details differ between contexts and languages.\n\nIn many languages, notably the C family, l-values have storage addresses that are programmatically accessible to the running program (e.g., via some address-of operator like \"&\" in C/C++), meaning that they are variables or dereferenced references to a certain memory location. R-values can be l-values (see below) or non-l-values—a term only used to distinguish from l-values. Consider the C expression codice_1. When executed, the computer generates an integer value of 13, but because the program has not explicitly designated where in the computer this 13 is stored, the expression is a non l-value. On the other hand, if a C program declares a variable x and assigns the value of 13 to x, then the expression codice_2 has a value of 13 and is an l-value.\n\nIn C, the term l-value originally meant something that could be assigned to (hence the name, indicating it is on the left side of the assignment operator), but since the reserved word codice_3 (constant) was added to the language, the term is now 'modifiable l-value'. In C++11 a special semantic-glyph codice_4 exists, to denote the \"use/access of the expression's address for the \"compiler\" only\"; i.e., the address cannot be retrieved using the address-of, codice_5, operator during the \"run-time\" of the program (see the use of move semantics).\n\nThis type of reference can be applied to \"all\" r-values including non-l-values as well as l-values. Some processors provide one or more instructions which take an immediate value, sometimes referred to as \"immediate\" for short. An immediate value is stored as part of the instruction which employs it, usually to load into, add to, or subtract from, a register. The other parts of the instruction are the opcode, and destination. The latter may be implicit. (A non-immediate value may reside in a register, or be stored elsewhere in memory, requiring the instruction to contain a direct or indirect address [e.g., index register address] to the value.)\n\nThe l-value expression designates (refers to) an object. A non-modifiable l-value is addressable, but not assignable. A modifiable l-value allows the designated object to be changed as well as examined. An r-value is any expression, a non-l-value is any expression that is not an l-value. One example is an \"immediate value\" (look below) and consequently not addressable..\n\nA value can be virtually any kind of data by a given data type, for instance a string, a digit, a single letter.\n\nProcessors often support more than one size of immediate data, e.g. 8 or 16 bit, employing a unique opcode and mnemonic for each instruction variant. If a programmer supplies a data value that will not fit, the assembler issues an \"Out of range\" error message. Most assemblers allow an immediate value to be expressed as ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary data. Thus, the ASCII character 'A' is the same as 65 or 0x41. The byte order of strings may differ between processors, depending on the assembler and computer architecture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38773637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38773637", "title": "Vertical and horizontal", "text": "Vertical and horizontal\n\nIn astronomy, geography, and related sciences and contexts, a \"direction\" or \"plane\" passing by a given point is said to be vertical if it contains the local gravity direction at that point.\n\nConversely, a direction or plane is said to be horizontal if it is perpendicular to the vertical direction.\n\nThe usage of the inter-related terms horizontal and vertical as well as their symmetries and asymmetries vary with context (e.g. two vs. three dimensions).\nIn general, something that is vertical can be drawn from up to down (or down to up), such as the y-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nGirard Desargues defined the vertical to be perpendicular to the horizon in his \"Perspective\" of 1636.\n\nThe word \"horizontal\" is derived from \"horizon\", whereas \"vertical\" originates in the late Latin \"\", which is from the same root as \"vertex\" 'highest point'.\n\nIn physics, in engineering, and in construction, the direction designated as vertical is usually that along which a plumb-bob hangs. Alternatively, a spirit level that exploits the buoyancy of an air bubble and its tendency to go vertically upwards may be used to test for horizontality. Modern rotary laser levels that can level themselves automatically are robust sophisticated instruments and work on the same fundamental principle.\n\nIn the flat earth scenario, where the earth is notionally a large (infinite) flat surface with gravitational field at a right angle to the surface, the earth surface is horizontal and any plane parallel to the earth surface is also horizontal. Vertical planes, e.g., walls, may be parallel to each other or they may intersect at a vertical line. Horizontal surfaces do not intersect. Furthermore, a plane cannot both be a horizontal plane at one place and a vertical plane somewhere else.\n\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the concepts of vertical and horizontal take on yet another meaning. On the surface of a smoothly spherical, homogenous, non-rotating planet, the plumb bob picks out as vertical the radial direction. Strictly speaking, it is now no longer possible for vertical walls to be parallel: \"all\" verticals intersect. This fact has real practical applications in construction and civil engineering, e.g., the tops of the towers of a suspension bridge are further apart than at the bottom. \n\nAlso, horizontal planes can intersect when they are tangent planes to separated points on the surface of the earth. In particular, a plane tangent to a point on the equator intersects the plane tangent to the North Pole at a right angle. (See diagram).\nFurthermore, the equatorial plane is parallel to the tangent plane at the North Pole and as such has claim to be a horizontal plane. But it is. at the same time, a vertical plane for points on the equator. In this sense, a plane can, arguably, be \"both\" horizontal and vertical, horizontal \"at one place\", and vertical \"at another\".\n\nFor a spinning earth, the plumb line deviates from the radial direction as a function of latitude. Only at the North and South Poles does the plumb line align with the local radius. The situation is actually even more complicated because earth is not a homogeneous smooth sphere. It is a non homogeneous, non spherical, knobby planet in motion, and the vertical not only need not lie along a radial, it may even be curved and be varying with time. On a smaller scale, a mountain to one side may deflect the plumb bob away from the true zenith.\n\nOn a larger scale the gravitational field of the earth, which is at least approximately radial near the earth, is not radial when it is affected by the moon at higher altitudes.\n\nOn a (horizontal) floor, one can draw a horizontal line but not a vertical line in the sense of a plumb bob line. But on a (vertical) wall, one can draw both vertical \"and\" horizontal lines. In this sense, a vertical wall allows more options. This is reflected in the tools a bricklayer uses: a plumb line for verticality and a spirit level to check that the mortar courses are horizontal.\nOn the other hand, in contrast to a wall a horizontal floor allows more options when one considers compass directions. One can draw on a floor lines going north, south, east, and west, in fact, along any compass direction. A wall allows fewer options. For instance, on a wall which runs along a longitude, an insect cannot crawl east.\n\nNeglecting the curvature of the earth, horizontal and vertical motions of a projectile moving under gravity are independent of each other. Vertical displacement of a projectile is not affected by the horizontal component of the launch velocity, and, conversely, the horizontal displacement is unaffected by the vertical component. The notion dates at least as far back as Galileo.\n\nWhen the curvature of the earth is taken into account, the independence of the two motion does \"not\" hold. For example, even a projectile fired in a horizontal direction (i.e., with a zero vertical component) may leave the surface of the spherical earth and indeed escape altogether.\n\nIn the context of a two-dimensional orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system on a Euclidean plane, to say that a line is horizontal or vertical, an initial designation has to be made. One can start off by designating the vertical direction, usually labelled the Y direction. The horizontal direction, usually labelled the X direction, is then automatically determined. Or, one can do it the other way around, i.e., nominate the \"x\"-axis, in which case the \"y\"-axis is then automatically determined. There is no special reason to choose the horizontal over the vertical as the initial designation: the two directions are on par in this respect.\n\nThe following hold in the two-dimensional case:\n\nNot all of these elementary geometric facts are true in the 3-D context.\n\nIn the three-dimensional case, the situation is more complicated as now one has horizontal and vertical planes in addition to horizontal and vertical lines. Consider a point P and designate a direction through P as vertical. A plane which contains P and is normal to the designated direction is the \"horizontal plane\" at P. Any plane going through P, normal to the horizontal plane is a \"vertical plane\" at P. Through any point P, there is one and only one horizontal plane but a \"multiplicity\" of vertical planes. This is a new feature that emerges in three dimensions. The symmetry that exists in the two-dimensional case no longer holds.\n\nIn the 2-dimension case, as mentioned already, the usual designation of the vertical coincides with the y-axis in co-ordinate geometry. This convention can cause confusion in the classroom. For the teacher, writing perhaps on a white board, the \"y\"-axis really is vertical in the sense of the plumbline verticality but for the student the axis may well lie on a horizontal table.\n\nAlthough the word horizontal is commonly used in daily life and language (see below), it is subject to many misconceptions.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, something that is horizontal can be drawn from left to right (or right to left), such as the x-axis in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nThe concept of a horizontal plane is thus anything but simple, although, in practice, most of these effects and variations are rather small: they are measurable and can be predicted with great accuracy, but they may not greatly affect our daily life.\n\nThis dichotomy between the apparent simplicity of a concept and an actual complexity of defining (and measuring) it in scientific terms arises from the fact that the typical linear scales and dimensions of relevance in daily life are 3 orders of magnitude (or more) smaller than the size of the Earth. Hence, the world appears to be flat locally, and horizontal planes in nearby locations appear to be parallel. Such statements are nevertheless approximations; whether they are acceptable in any particular context or application depends on the applicable requirements, in particular in terms of accuracy.\n\nIn graphical contexts, such as drawing and drafting and Co-ordinate geometry on rectangular paper, it is very common to associate one of the dimensions of the paper with a horizontal, even though the entire sheet of paper is standing on a flat horizontal (or slanted) table. In this case, the horizontal direction is typically from the left side of the paper to the right side. This is purely conventional (although it is somehow 'natural' when drawing a natural scene as it is seen in reality), and may lead to misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in an educational context.\n\n\n\n"}

Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the right to vote could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.\n\nIn \"Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor\" (1998), the High Court suggested on an \"obiter\" basis that voting is a privilege rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer the existence of the right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and from the fact that it is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.\n\nThe Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act regulate the exercise of the vote and set out the procedures for parliamentary and presidential elections in Singapore. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. All Singapore citizens not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A one person, one vote system is currently in operation, though in 1994 Senior Minister and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the 2006 general election.\n\nA person is disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners the right to vote has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.\n\nThe right to vote forms the foundation of representative democracy, that is, democracy based on the principle of citizens electing a group of people to represent their interests. The various models of government that fall under the general term \"representative democracy\", namely, the protective, participatory and elite models, are all based upon the underlying principle of equality of rights, including the right to vote.\n\n\"Popular government\" was referred to by John Stuart Mill as \"where the supreme controlling power ... is vested in the entire aggregate of the community\", while Edmund Burke argued that it has the desirable consequence of establishing a government that has a unified public interest, with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of the public good. The right to vote then provides the means for individuals to voice their support of or opposition to government. Their aggregated choices enable the will of the people to control the extent of power and perpetuity of governments, thus protecting society's rights and interests.\n\nThomas Paine, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, said that the right to vote is critical in the protection of individual freedoms. He called it one of an individual's personal rights, which are \"a species of property of the most sacred kind\", and expressed the view that \"[t]o take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, ... subject to the will of another ... [T]o disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal to take away property\". Paine's view was that there is no justification for one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as Article 21(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court case \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote:\n\nThe term \"representative democracy\" does not appear in the Constitution of Singapore. However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the High Court of Australia to the Australian Constitution. In \"Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" (1997), the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and responsible government from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that Parliament may be dissolved by the Prime Minister under certain conditions, and will be automatically dissolved by operation of law five years from its first sitting. A general election must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament. The Constitution also states that \"[t]he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature\", and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before the expiry date, within six months of the date when it becomes vacant. In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement, which was entered into by the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 \"Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation ...\".\n\nIn \"Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor\" (1998), the High Court expressed the \"obiter\" view that the right to vote does not have constitutional status but is a privilege:\n\nThe juridical status of the right to vote was subsequently debated in Parliament on 16 May 2001 upon an adjournment motion introduced by Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam. Jeyaretnam argued that since \"the marking of a ballot paper is an expression of the voter\", the right to vote is protected by the freedom of expression clause set out in Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore. Responding, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, stated:\n\nThe heading of section 38 of the Parliamentary Elections Act (\"PEA\") is \"Registers of electors to be conclusive evidence of right to vote\". Subsection (1) provides that the current register of electors is conclusive evidence for determining whether a person is entitled to vote at an election, and subsection (2) states that a person's \"right and duty of voting\" is not prejudiced if there is an appeal pending as to whether his or her name is properly on the register.\n\nThe status of the right to vote was again considered in Parliament in 2009. During debates on the Ministry of Law's annual budget on 12 February, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann asked if the right to vote is \"a constitutional right and part of the fundamental law of the land, or merely a statutory right, regulated by ordinary law?\" Replying to Thio the following day, Minister for Law K. Shanmugam referred to the 2001 debate on the matter and confirmed that, having conferred with the Attorney-General, in the Government's view the right to vote is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions of the Constitution, including Articles 65 and 66. Article 65 sets out the requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament. Articles 65(2) to 65(3A) explain when the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament, while Article 65(4) specifically provides that Parliament has a fixed term: \"Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for 5 years from the date of its first sitting and shall then stand dissolved.\" Article 66 states: \"There shall be a general election at such time, within 3 months after every dissolution of Parliament, as the President shall, by Proclamation in the Gazette, appoint.\" The Minister also said:\n\nAs regards the High Court's view in \"Taw Cheng Kong\", the Minister noted that it could not be treated as a precedent since \"[t]he legal nature of the citizens' right to vote was not an issue in that case and was not specifically argued\". Thio Li-ann has commented that the Minister's clarification \"dealt the \"quietus est\" to the High Court's odd pronouncement in \"Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor\"\".\n\nOn 18 January 1966, shortly after Singapore's independence, the President appointed a Constitutional Commission led by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin to consider how the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected. In its report on 27 August 1966, the Commission recommended entrenching the right to vote as a \"fundamental right\" in the form of \"the right to elect a government of their choice as expressed in general elections held at reasonable periodic intervals by secret vote\". The chief justification for this proposal was the relatively infant or immature culture of democracy in a newly independent nation that was \"barely one year old\". The report noted that citizens had only exercised the right to vote twice in general elections, in 1959 and 1963 respectively. Hence:\n\nHowever, Parliament decided not to entrench the right to vote, instead relegating voting rights to statutory regulation under the Parliamentary Elections Act.\n\nDuring the 2009 parliamentary debate on the right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.\n\nHowever, the Minister for Law said the Government was of the opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was unnecessary for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force. That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a bill that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time. Therefore, it could be assumed that the idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in Singaporean voters. Furthermore, some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others, like Singapore, set out a basic philosophy. He noted that countries such as North Korea and Myanmar were among those that had set out the right to vote within their constitutions. Shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting the right to vote was a Government committed to the rule of law. \n\nFollowing the parliamentary debate, in a 2009 article Thio elaborated that entrenching the right to vote in the Constitution would make it significantly more difficult for any corrupt government that came into power to curtail it, as a super-majority of at least two-thirds of all elected Members of Parliament would be needed before a constitutional amendment could be made. Otherwise, with control over a simple majority of Parliament, a ruling party, if it chose to, could direct amendments to the PEA or create new legislation to provide some citizens with, say, double the number of votes and protect this from constitutional challenge using a notwithstanding clause (that is, a provision stated to have legal effect despite the existence of other inconsistent laws). By not protecting such an important right, the freedom of Singapore's electoral system could be progressively curtailed. A similar point has been made by Singapore Management University constitutional law professor Jack Lee who noted that since Article 66 does not define the term \"general election\":\n\nThio also argued that without a constitutionally expressed right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and the fact that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.\n\nDespite the Government's unequivocal view that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status is not likely to be brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.\n\nThio has argued that a court convened to determine whether the right to vote exists in the Constitution would give serious weight to the Minister of Law's pronouncements on the status of the right, as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power. Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act requires a purposive interpretation of written law, including the Constitution, to \"promote the purpose or object underlying the written law\". Sections 9A(3)(c) and (d) identify ministerial speeches made at the second readings of bills or \"any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament\" as appropriate aspects of the interpretive matrix. The court might then take one or both of the following approaches.\n\nThe courts may choose to establish an imputed intention or traditional understanding of the existence of a right to vote, derived from the drafting style associated with the drafters of Westminster constitutions rather than the drafted text as it is. Thio has said that the framers of the Constitution worked with certain assumptions which they did not make explicit. In \"Hinds v. The Queen\" (1975), the Privy Council said that:\n\nThe court in \"Hinds\" held that, as \"a rule of construction applicable to constitutional instruments\" adopting the Westminster system, the \"absence of express words\" did not prevent the judicial powers of the new state being exclusively exercised by the judicature\". Similarly, the right to vote was necessarily implied into the Constitution through its genesis as an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy.\n\nThio has also argued that the courts may find that an implied right to vote can be derived from the existing structure of the Constitution and a purposive reading of Articles 65 and 66. According to this reading, a constitutional right to vote must be logically or practically necessary for preserving the integrity of that structure, as constitutionally established. In Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, the appointment of the Prime Minister requires that he commands \"the confidence of the majority of the Members of Parliament\". As the Constitution places emphasis on the need for democratic legitimacy as well as general elections, it may be reasonable to infer that the structure of the Constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of democratic legitimacy.\n\nThe Parliamentary Elections Act regulates the exercise of the vote and sets out the procedures for parliamentary elections in Singapore. The right to vote in Singapore extends only to Singapore citizens who are ordinarily resident in Singapore and not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors. This is known as the \"prescribed date\", and is currently 1 January of a particular year. A person is considered to be ordinarily resident in Singapore on 1 January in a year if he or she has lived in the country for a total of 30 days during the three years immediately before that date, even if on 1 January the person is not resident in the country. Whether people are entitled to vote at a presidential election also depends on whether they are entitled to have their names entered or retained in a register of electors maintained under the PEA.\n\nSingapore has a one person, one vote system: plural voting – that is, voting more than once in the electoral division that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division – is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: \"It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government.\" Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine \"Foreign Affairs\" in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because \"he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that.\" In a later media interview published in \"The Straits Times\" on 8 May 1994, Lee said:\n\nLee suggested that such a change should perhaps be implemented \"in 15 to 20 years\" if Singapore's birth rate had not increased, as policies might then be disproportionately influenced by people aged 60 and over. However, he emphasized that these were his personal views and had not been discussed by the Cabinet. To date, no such modification to the voting system has been made.\n\nPrior to May 2001, voters who were overseas on polling day could not vote. Operational concerns such as insufficient Singapore missions around the world, the possibility that the last known addresses of Singapore citizens overseas might not be current, and the difficulty of keeping track of citizens who were abroad, were cited for this restriction. Some commentators took the view that such logistical issues should not deprive Singaporeans of their \"sacred right to vote\".\n\nOverseas voting was eventually introduced for both parliamentary and presidential elections with effect from 15 May 2001. Speaking during the Second Reading of the bill that led to the change in the law, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, said that the Government recognized that increasing numbers of Singaporeans studied and worked abroad due to economic globalization. Thus, it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at the next general elections. At that time, the law generally required overseas voters to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the five-year period before the prescribed date. However, Singaporeans whom the Government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families. The Minister explained that this requirement for residence in Singapore was a \"necessary pre-condition to constituency representation and to prevent plural voting\". J.B. Jeyaretnam criticized this restriction as discriminating against overseas voters.\n\nHowever, following the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks. Therefore, overseas voting first took place at the 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.\n\nWith effect from 3 March 2009, the residence requirement for overseas voters was reduced to an aggregate of 30 days during the three years immediately before the prescribed date, and the special dispensation of the requirement applying to citizens working or studying abroad at the Government's direction and their families was removed. The change was described in Parliament as a measure to \"allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs to do is to come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends.\"\n\nA person is disqualified from voting in the following situations, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence:\n\n\nSingapore citizens who vote in foreign countries may lose their right to vote in Singapore. The relevant provisions are section 6(1)(a)(ii) read with section 6(3) of the PEA:\n\nOne issue that has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes in a foreign country where the right to vote is not exclusive to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore, who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections. When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.\n\nAnother potentially controversial provision is section 6(1)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which denies suffrage to convicted criminals serving jail sentences. The provision states:\n\nIn addition, section 6(1A) provides as follows:\n\nThe issue of the constitutionality of this restriction has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional.\n\nThe Singapore position may be compared with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms. In \"Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia\" (2009), it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960 – who have not been convicted of any crime – still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.\n\nA survey of European countries reported in \"Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2)\" (2005), a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners were not allowed to vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In \"Hirst\", the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.\n\nIn Canada, the Supreme Court held in \"Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)\" (2002), that a statutory provision prohibiting prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be denied the right to vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.\n\nThe foregoing cases may be contrasted with the position in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States held in \"Richardson v. Ramirez\" (1974) that a California statute permanently removing the right to vote from any person convicted of an \"infamous crime\" unless the right to vote was restored by court order or executive pardon did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court noted that there was explicit constitutional approval for laws disenfranchising felons since section 2 of the Amendment reduced a state's representation in Congress if the state has denied the right to vote for any reason \"except for participation in rebellion, or other crime\". Thus, it was unnecessary for the statute in question to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests to be consistent with equal protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
