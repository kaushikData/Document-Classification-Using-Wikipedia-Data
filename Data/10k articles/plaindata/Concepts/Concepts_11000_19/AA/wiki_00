It is designed to be a very simple, beginner-friendly game system.\n\nThe name of the game is a pun on the famous \"Dungeons & Dragons\" or \"D&D\"; the original version of the game – \"Defensores de Tóquio\" (\"Defenders of Tokyo\") – was a satire of tokusatsu, fighting games, and anime series. It was created by Marcelo Cassaro and published by Trama Editorial, later known as Editora Talismã. It spawned \"AD&T\" - as implied by the name, an \"advanced\" edition (and a pun on AD&D). Finally, \"3D&T\" means \"Defenders of Tokyo 3rd edition\". The major change on the 3rd edition was that it was turned into a generic game, dropping its satire roots. It was a huge success, becoming as popular as \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"\" among Brazilian roleplayers.\n\nAn even simpler version, like GURPS Lite called \"3D&T Fastplay\", was made freely available online.\n\nA revision, \"3D&T Manual Revisado, Ampliado e Turbinado\", was released in 2003.\n\nDissatisfied with the poor management at Talismã – also publishers of RPG magazine \"Dragão Brasil\", of which he was editor-in-chief – Marcelo Cassaro left to start a new RPG magazine, \"RPG Master\" for Mythos Editora, a magazine entirely dedicated to 3D&T (although the news releases for other systems) and soon after, \"Dragon Slayer\", fully devoted to the d20 System; meanwhile, Talismã kept publishing 3D&T, despite \"not\" having the rights to do so. Ultimately, \"Dragon Slayer\" was very successful and remains in print, while Talismã closed their doors.\n\nAs a successor to 3D&T, a new system named 4D&T was published in 2006 by Editora JBC (Brazilian publisher of manga). It completely dropped 3D&T's own fast, in this the player uses 4 six-sided dice. The book was published under the Open Game License. This edition is itself a change of the d20 System, but with six-sided dice.\n\nAlthough it has succeeded on its own, it has been poorly received by 3D&T players, given the original purpose of the system was to be as simple as possible.\n\nIn May 2008, Cassaro was told by Guilherme Dei Svaldi, editor-in-chief at Jambô Editora, that he found 3D&T to remain very popular, despite being out of print for years. This surprised Cassaro, and gave him the idea of bringing 3D&T back; it was released again in September 2008, under the name \"3D&T Alpha\" (the new name inspired by \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", which Cassaro and Erica Awano had adapted into a 4-issue comic book series published by Trama in 1998/99). It is also available as a free e-book from Jambô's website. In this new version, the combat rules remain basically the same; the advantage/disadvantage system was fine-tuned; and, most importantly, the magic system was completely revamped. Also, now the book is printed in landscape format.\n\nIn 2010 the first major setting for 3D&T Alpha was announced: Mega City, by Gustavo Brauner. It was finally published in mid-2012, bringing as setting a megalopolis in which five different smaller settings coexist: \nMega City allows to either choose one of the smaller settings to play, or to combine some of them (or even all of them), teaching how to balance the different kinds of characters.\n\nA second major setting was released in the same year: Brigada Ligeira Estelar \"(Star Light Brigade),\" by Alexandre Lancaster. It's a mecha/space opera/swashbuckling setting, bringing an empire spread in seventeen solar systems that together form the Constellation of Sabre – main target of invaders from outer space called \"The Forsaken,\" while the empire itself is divided by political intrigue. \"Brigada\" brings a heavy influence of classic sci-fi anime like Mobile Suit Gundam, Captain Harlock, Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Star Blazers, having as player characters mecha ace pilots, space pirates, space condottieri, swashbuckling noblemen and others.\n\nA game aimed at beginners, 3D&T focus on simplicity and ease of play.\n\nAs in GURPS, each character is built with a pre-determined number of \"points\" (typically 5) to distribute between the main stats, magic power and advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThere are 5 stats:\n\nThe magical powers of characters are defined by \"Elemental Paths\" (\"Caminhos Elementais\", in the original), which measure how well the mage can control the elements - there are 6 \"Elemental Paths\": Fire (\"Fogo\"), Water (\"Água\"), Earth (\"Terra\"), Air (\"Ar\"), Light (\"Luz\") and Darkness (\"Trevas\").\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages are special powers which characters can possess; advantages cost points, and disadvantages \"give\" more points to spend. Finally, there is also a special kind of advantages, called \"skills\" (\"Perícias\"), which are things that your character can do, but with no relation to combat: \"Animals\",\"Arts\", \"Crime\", \"Investigation\",\"Languages\", \"Machines\",\"Manipulation\", \"Medicine\", \"Science\",\"Sports\" and \"Survival.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "79912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79912", "title": "Baronet", "text": "Baronet\n\nA baronet ( or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, , or ; abbreviation Btss), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.\n\nA baronetcy is the only British hereditary honour that is not a peerage, with the exception of the Anglo-Irish Black Knight, White Knight and Green Knight (of which only the Green Knight is extant). A baronet is addressed as \"Sir\" (just as is a knight) or \"Dame\" in the case of a baronetess but ranks above all knighthoods and damehoods in the order of precedence, except for the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, and the dormant Order of St Patrick. Baronets are conventionally seen to belong to the lesser nobility even though William Thoms claims that \"The precise quality of this dignity is not yet fully determined, some holding it to be the head of the \"nobiles minores\", while others, again, rank Baronets as the lowest of the \"nobiles majores\", because their honour, like that of the higher nobility, is both hereditary and created by patent.\"\n\nComparisons with continental titles and ranks are tenuous due to the British system of primogeniture and the fact that claims to baronetcies must be proven; currently the Official Roll of the Baronetage is overseen by the Ministry of Justice. In practice this means that the UK Peerage and Baronetage consists of about 2000 families (some Peers are also Baronets), which is roughly 0.01% of UK families. In some continental countries the nobility consisted of about 5% of the population, and in most countries titles are no longer recognised or regulated by the state.\n\nThe term \"baronet\" has medieval origins. Sir Thomas de La More, describing the Battle of Boroughbridge, mentioned that baronets took part, along with barons and knights. Edward III is known to have created eight baronets in 1328; further creations were made in 1340, 1446 and 1551. At least one, Sir William de La Pole in 1340, was created for payment of money. Whether or not these early creations were hereditary, all have died out.\n\nPresent-day Baronets date from 1611 when James I granted Letters Patent to 200 gentlemen of good birth with an income of at least £1,000 a year; in return for the honour, each was required to pay for the upkeep of thirty soldiers for three years amounting to £1,095, in those days a very large sum. In 1619 James I established the Baronetage of Ireland; Charles I in 1625 created the Baronetages of Scotland and Nova Scotia. The new baronets were each required to pay 2,000 marks or to support six colonial settlers for two years. Over a hundred of these baronetcies, now familiarly known as Scottish baronetcies, survive to this day. \n\nAs a result of the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, all future creations were styled baronets of Great Britain. Following the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, new creations were styled as baronets of the United Kingdom. \n\nUnder royal warrants of 1612 and 1613, certain privileges were accorded to baronets. Firstly, no person or persons should have place between baronets and the younger sons of peers. Secondly, the right of knighthood was established for the eldest sons of baronets (this was later revoked by George IV in 1827), and thirdly, baronets were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the Arms of Ulster on an inescutcheon: \"in a field Argent, a Hand Geules (or a bloudy hand)\". These privileges were extended to baronets of Ireland, and for baronets of Scotland the privilege of depicting the Arms of Nova Scotia as an augmentation of honour. The former applies to this day for all baronets of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom created subsequently.\n\nThe title of baronet was initially conferred upon noblemen who lost the right of individual summons to Parliament, and was used in this sense in a statute of Richard II. A similar title of lower rank was banneret.\n\nSince 1965 only one new baronetcy has been created, for Sir Denis Thatcher on 7 December 1990, husband of a former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher (\"later\" Baroness Thatcher); their eldest son, Sir Mark Thatcher, succeeded as 2nd Baronet upon his father's death in 2003.\n\nLike knights, baronets are accorded the style \"Sir\" before their first name. Baronetesses in their own right use \"Dame\", also before their first name, while wives of baronets use \"Lady\" followed by the husband's (marital) surname only, this by longstanding courtesy. Wives of baronets are not baronetesses; only women holding baronetcies in their own right are so styled.\n\nUnlike knighthoods – which apply to the recipient only – a baronetcy is hereditarily entailed. The eldest son of a baronet who is born in wedlock succeeds to a baronetcy upon his father's death, but will not be officially recognised until his name is recognised by being placed on the Official Roll. With some exceptions granted with special remainder by letters patent, baronetcies descend through the male line.\n\nA full list of extant baronets appears in \"Burke's Peerage and Baronetage\", which also published a record of extinct baronetcies.\n\nA baronetcy is not a peerage, so baronets like knights and junior members of peerage families are commoners and not peers of the realm (N.B., in the UK, all people save the Sovereign and peers are considered commoners). According to the Home Office there is a tangible benefit to the honour of baronet: according to law, a baronet is entitled to have \"a pall supported by two men, a principal mourner and four others\" assisting at his funeral. Originally baronets also had other rights, including the right to have the eldest son knighted on his 21st birthday. However, at the beginning of George IV's reign, these rights were eroded by Orders-in-Council on the grounds that Sovereigns should not necessarily be bound by acts made by their predecessors. Baronets although never having been automatically entitled to heraldic supporters, were allowed them in heredity in the first half of the 19th century where the title holder was also a Knight Grand Cross of a Crown order.\n\nBaronets of Scotland or Nova Scotia were allowed to augment their armorial bearings with the Arms of Nova Scotia and the privilege of wearing a neck badge signifying \"of Nova Scotia\", suspended by an orange-tawny ribbon. This consists of an escutcheon Argent with a Saltire Azure, an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland, with an Imperial Crown above the escutcheon, and encircled with the motto \"Fax Mentis Honestae Gloria\". This badge may be shown suspended by the ribbon below the escutcheon.\n\nBaronets of England and Ireland applied to King Charles I for permission to wear a badge. Although a badge was worn in the 17th century, it was not until 1929 that King George V granted permission for all baronets (other than those of Scotland) to wear badges.\n\nA baronet is referred to and addressed as, for example, \"Sir <Joseph>\" (using his forename). The correct style on an envelope for a baronet who has no other titles is \"Sir <Joseph Bloggs>, Bt.\" or \"Sir <Joseph Bloggs>, Bart.\" The letter would commence: \"Dear Sir <Joseph>\".\n\nThe wife of a baronet is addressed and referred to as \"Lady <Bloggs>\"; at the head of a letter as \"Dear Lady <Bloggs>\". Her given name is used only when necessary to distinguish between two holders of the same title. For example, if a baronet has died and the title has passed to his son, the widow (the new baronet's mother) will remain \"Lady <Bloggs>\" if he (the son) is unmarried or never marries, but if he is married or becomes married then his wife becomes \"Lady <Bloggs>\" while his mother will be known by the style \"<Alice>, Lady <Bloggs>\". Alternatively, the mother may prefer to be known as \"The Dowager Lady <Bloggs>\". A previous wife will also become \"<Alice>, Lady Bloggs\" to distinguish her from the current wife of the incumbent baronet. She would not be \"Lady <Alice> <Bloggs>\", a style reserved for the daughters of Dukes, Marquesses and Earls. \n\nThe children of a baronet are not entitled to the use of any courtesy titles.\n\nFor a baronetess one should write \"Dame <Daisy Smith>, Btss\" on the envelope. At the head of the letter, one would write \"Dear Dame <Daisy>,\" and to refer to her, one would say \"Dame <Daisy>\" or \"Dame <Daisy Smith>\" (never \"Dame <Smith>\").\n\nIn history there have been only four baronetesses:\n\n\nIn 1976 Lord Lyon King of Arms stated that, without examining the patent of every Scottish baronetcy, he was not in a position to confirm that only these four title creations could pass through female lines.\n\n, there are no living baronetesses.\n\nAll baronetcies are created with a territorial sub-designation, however only more recent creations duplicating the original creation require territorial designations. So, for example, there are baronetcies Moore of Colchester, Moore of Hancox, Moore of Kyleburn, and Moore of Moore Lodge.\n\nBaronets of England, Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom (\"i.e.\" all except baronets of Nova Scotia) can display the Red Hand of Ulster (sinister (left) hand version) as a heraldic badge, being the arms of the ancient kings of Ulster. This badge (or augmentation of honour) is blazoned as follows: \"Argent a Hand sinister couped at the wrist extended in pale Gules\". King James I of England established the hereditary Order of Baronets in England on 22 May 1611, in the words of \"Collins' Peerage\" (1741): \"for the plantation and protection of the whole Kingdom of Ireland, but more especially for the defence and security of the Province of Ulster, and therefore for their distinction those of this order and their descendants may bear the badge (Red Hand of Ulster) in their coats of arms either in canton or an escutcheon at their election\". Since 1929 such baronets may also display the Red Hand of Ulster on its own as a badge, suspended by a ribbon below the shield of arms.\n\nBaronets of Nova Scotia, unlike other baronets, do not use the Baronet's Badge (of Ulster), but have their own badge showing the escutcheon of the arms of Nova Scotia: \"Argent, a Saltire Azure with an inescutcheon of the Royal Arms of Scotland\". From before 1929 to the present it has been customary practice for such baronets to display this badge on its own suspended by the order's ribbon below the shield of arms.\nThe first publication listing all baronetcies ever created was C. J. Parry's \"Index of Baronetcy Creations\" (1967). This listed them in alphabetical order, other than the last five creations (Dodds of West Chillington, Redmayne of Rushcliffe, Pearson of Gressingham, Finlay of Epping and Thatcher of Scotney). It showed the total number created from 1611 to 1964 to have been 3,482. They include five of Oliver Cromwell, several of which were recreated by Charles II. Twenty-five were created between 1688 and 1784 by James II in exile after his dethronement, by his son James Stuart (\"The Old Pretender\") and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart (\"Bonny Prince Charlie\"). These \"Jacobite baronetcies\" were never accepted by the English Crown, have all disappeared and should properly be excluded from the 3,482, making the effective number of creations 3,457. A close examination of Parry's publication shows he missed one or two, so there may well have been some more.\n\nAs of 2000, including baronetcies where succession was dormant or unproven, there was a total of 1,314 baronetcies divided into five classes of creation included on \"The Official Roll of the Baronetage\" – 146 of England, 63 of Ireland, 119 of Scotland, 133 of Great Britain and 853 of the United Kingdom. \n\nThe total number of baronetcies today is approximately 1,204, although only some 1,020 are on \"The Official Roll of the Baronetage\". It is unknown whether some baronetcies remain extant and it may be that nobody can prove himself to be the actual heir. Over 200 baronetcies are now held by peers and others, such as the Knox line, have been made tenuous due to internal family dispute.\n\nThere were 1,490 baronetcies extant on 1 January 1965. Since then there has been a loss of about 260 baronetcies through extinction or dormancy resulting in a gross decline of 17.5% or almost one-sixth over 50 years.\n\nThere have however been some exceptions to this trend – a new creation (Thatcher baronetcy, \"of Scotney\" (1990)) and five baronetcies dormant in 1965 and since revived – Innes baronetcy, \"of Coxton\" (1686), Nicolson baronetcy of that Ilk and of Lasswade (1629), Hope baronetcy, \"of Kirkliston\" (1698), St John (\"later\" St John-Mildmay) baronetcy, \"of Farley\" (1772) and Maxwell-Macdonald baronetcy of Pollok (1682)\n\nThus the net loss is 254 or 17.1%. Extant baronetcies number about 1,236 (as of 2015).\n\nBaronetcies usually descend through heirs male of the body of the grantee, and can rarely be inherited by females or collateral kins, unless created with special remainder, for example:\n\nThe Premier Baronet (of England) is the unofficial title afforded to the current holder of the oldest extant baronetcy in the realm. The Premier Baronet is regarded as the senior member of the Baronetage, and ranks above other baronets (unless they hold a peerage title) in the United Kingdom Order of Precedence. Sir Nicholas Bacon, 14th Baronet, is the current Premier Baronet, whose family's senior title was created by King James I in 1611.\n\nThe Premier Baronets of Nova Scotia (Scotland) were the Gordon baronets of Gordonstoun and Letterfourie until the title's extinction in 1908. Subsequently, the Premier Scottish Baronets are the Innes baronets of that Ilk (cr. 28 May 1625), the present Premier Baronet being Guy Innes-Ker, 10th Duke of Roxburghe.\n\nThe Premier Baronetcy of Ireland was created for Sir Dominic Sarsfield in 1619, and was held by his successors until the attainder of the 4th Viscount Sarsfield in 1691. Since then the descendants of Sir Francis Annesley Bt., the Annesley baronets, have been the Premier Baronets of Ireland; presently Francis William Dighton Annesley, 16th Viscount Valentia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a complete list see also list of Canadian baronetcies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "882427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882427", "title": "Categorial grammar", "text": "Categorial grammar\n\nCategorial grammar is a term used for a family of formalisms in natural language syntax motivated by the principle of compositionality and organized according to the view that syntactic constituents should generally combine as functions or according to a function-argument relationship. Most versions of categorial grammar analyze sentence structure in terms of constituencies (as opposed to dependencies) and are therefore phrase structure grammars (as opposed to dependency grammars).\n\nA categorial grammar consists of two parts: a lexicon, which assigns a set of types (also called categories) to each basic symbol, and some type inference rules, which determine how the type of a string of symbols follows from the types of the constituent symbols. It has the advantage that the type inference rules can be fixed once and for all, so that the specification of a particular language grammar is entirely determined by the lexicon.\n\nA categorial grammar shares some features with the simply typed lambda calculus.\nWhereas the lambda calculus has only one function type formula_1,\na categorial grammar typically has two function types, one type which is applied on the left,\nand one on the right. For example, a simple categorial grammar might have two function types formula_2 and formula_3.\nThe first, formula_2, is the type of a phrase that results in a phrase of type\nformula_5 when followed (on the right) by a phrase of type formula_6.\nThe second, formula_7, is the type of a phrase that results\nin a phrase of type formula_5 when preceded (on the left) by a phrase of type \nformula_6. \n\nThe notation is based upon algebra. A fraction when multiplied by (i.e. concatenated with) its denominator yields its numerator. As concatenation is not commutative, it makes a difference whether the denominator occurs to the left or right. The concatenation must be on the same side as the denominator for it to cancel out.\n\nThe first and simplest kind of categorial grammar is called a basic categorial grammar, or sometimes an AB-grammar (after Ajdukiewicz and Bar-Hillel).\nGiven a set of primitive types formula_10, let \nformula_11 be the set of types constructed from primitive types. In the basic case, this is the least set such that formula_12\nand if formula_13\nthen formula_14.\nThink of these as purely formal expressions freely generated from the primitive types; any semantics will be added later. Some authors assume a fixed infinite set of primitive types used by all grammars, but by making the primitive types part of the grammar, the whole construction is kept finite.\n\nA basic categorial grammar is a tuple formula_15\nwhere formula_16 is a finite set of symbols,\nformula_10 is a finite set of primitive types, and formula_18.\n\nThe relation formula_19 is the lexicon, which relates types to symbols formula_20.\nSince the lexicon is finite, it can be specified by listing a set of pairs like formula_21.\n\nSuch a grammar for English might have three basic types formula_22, assigning count nouns the type formula_23, complete noun phrases the type\nformula_24, and sentences the type formula_25.\nThen an adjective could have the type formula_26, because if it is followed by a noun then the whole phrase is a noun. \nSimilarly, a determiner has the type formula_27,\nbecause it forms a complete noun phrase when followed by a noun.\nIntransitive verbs have the type formula_28, and transitive verbs the type formula_29.\nThen a string of words is a sentence if it has overall type formula_25.\n\nFor example, take the string \"the bad boy made that mess\". Now \"the\" and \"that\" are determiners, \"boy\" and \"mess\" are nouns, \"bad\" is an adjective, and \"made\" is a transitive verb, so the lexicon is\nformula_32,\nformula_33,\nformula_34,\nformula_35,\nformula_36}.\n\nand the sequence of types in the string is\n\nformula_37\n\nnow find functions and appropriate arguments and reduce them according to the two inference rules\nformula_38 and\nformula_39:\n\nformula_40<br>\nformula_41<br>\nformula_42<br>\nformula_43<br>\nformula_44<br>\nformula_45\n\nThe fact that the result is formula_25 means that the string is a sentence, while the sequence of reductions shows that it must be parsed as ((the (bad boy)) (made (that mess))).\n\nCategorial grammars of this form (having only function application rules) are equivalent in generative capacity to context-free grammars and are thus often considered inadequate for theories of natural language syntax. Unlike CFGs, categorial grammars are lexicalized, meaning that only a small number of (mostly language-independent) rules are employed, and all other syntactic phenomena derive from the lexical entries of specific words.\n\nAnother appealing aspect of categorial grammars is that it is often easy to assign them a compositional semantics, by first assigning interpretation types to all the basic categories, and then associating all the derived categories with appropriate function types. The interpretation of any constituent is then simply the value of a function at an argument. With some modifications to handle intensionality and quantification, this approach can be used to cover a wide variety of semantic phenomena.\n\nA Lambek grammar is an elaboration of this idea that has a\nconcatenation operator for types, and several other inference rules.\nPentus has shown that these still have the generative capacity of\ncontext-free grammars.\n\nFor the Lambek calculus, there is a type concatenation\noperator formula_47, so\nthat formula_12\nand if formula_13\nthen formula_50.\n\nThe Lambek calculus consists of several deduction rules, which specify\nhow type inclusion assertions can be derived. In the following\nrules, upper case roman letters stand for types, upper case Greek\nletters stand for sequences of types. A sequent of the form\nformula_51\ncan be read: a string is of type formula_52 if it consists of the concatenation\nof strings of each of the types in formula_53. If a type is\ninterpreted as a set of strings, then the\nformula_54 may be interpreted as formula_55,\nthat is, \"includes as a subset\". \nA horizontal line means that the inclusion above the line\nimplies the one below the line.\n\nThe process is begun by the Axiom rule, which has no antecedents and\njust says that any type includes itself.\n\n<math>\n(Axiom)\\quad\n"}

{"id": "804964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=804964", "title": "Dehumanization", "text": "Dehumanization\n\nDehumanization or an act thereof can describe a behavior or process that undermines individuality of and in others. Behaviorally, dehumanization describes a disposition towards others that debases the others' individuality as either an \"individual\" species or an \"individual\" object, e.g. someone who acts inhumanely towards humans. As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction, e.g. \"Technology revolutions cause the dehumanization of labor markets to the point of antiquation.\"\n\nIn almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization. As social norms define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane. Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms. This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization. If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history. However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a type-token ambiguity relative to both scales individual and societal.\n\nBiologically, dehumanization can be described as an introduced species marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.\n\nIn political science and jurisprudence, the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of human rights or denaturalization of natural rights, a definition contingent upon presiding international law rather than social norms limited by human geography. In this context, specialty within species need not apply to constitute global citizenship or its inalienable rights; these both are inherit by human genome.\n\nIt is theorized to take on two forms: \"animalistic dehumanization\", which is employed on a largely intergroup basis, and \"mechanistic dehumanization\", which is employed on a largely interpersonal basis. Dehumanization can occur discursively (e.g., idiomatic language that likens certain human beings to non-human animals, verbal abuse, erasing one's voice from discourse), symbolically (e.g., imagery), or physically (e.g., chattel slavery, physical abuse, refusing eye contact). Dehumanization often ignores the target's individuality (i.e., the creative and interesting aspects of their personality) and can hinder one from feeling empathy or properly understanding a stigmatized group of people.\n\nDehumanization may be carried out by a social institution (such as a state, school, or family), interpersonally, or even within the self. Dehumanization can be unintentional, especially on the part of individuals, as with some types of \"de facto\" racism. State-organized dehumanization has historically been directed against perceived political, racial, ethnic, national, or religious minority groups. Other minoritized and marginalized individuals and groups (based on sexual orientation, gender, disability, class, or some other organizing principle) are also susceptible to various forms of dehumanization. The concept of dehumanization has received empirical attention in the psychological literature. It is conceptually related to infrahumanization, delegitimization, moral exclusion, and objectification. Dehumanization occurs across several domains; is facilitated by status, power, and social connection; and results in behaviors like exclusion, violence, and support for violence against others.\n\n“Dehumanisation is viewed as a central component to intergroup violence because it is frequently the most important precursor to moral exclusion, the process by which stigmatized groups are placed outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply.”\n\nDavid Livingstone Smith, director and founder of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England, argues that historically, human beings have been dehumanizing one another for thousands of years.\n\nIn Herbert Kelman's work on dehumanization, humanness has two features: \"identity\" (i.e., a perception of the person \"as an individual, independent and distinguishable from others, capable of making choices\") and \"community\" (i.e., a perception of the person as \"part of an interconnected network of individuals who care for each other\"). When a target's agency and community embeddedness are denied, they no longer elicit compassion or other moral responses, and may suffer violence as a result.\n\nIn Nick Haslam's review of dehumanization, he differentiates between uniquely human (UH) characteristics, which distinguish humans from non-human animals, and human nature (HN), characteristics that are typical of or central to human beings. His model suggests that different types of dehumanization arise from the denial of one sense of humanness or the other. Language, higher order cognition, refined emotions, civility, and morality are uniquely human characteristics (i.e., traits humans have that non-human animals do not). Cognitive flexibility, emotionality, vital agency, and warmth are central to human nature. Characteristics of human nature are perceived to be widely shared among groups (i.e., every human has these traits), while uniquely human characteristics (e.g., civility, morality) are thought to vary between groups.\n\nAccording to Haslam, the animalistic form of dehumanization occurs when uniquely human characteristics (e.g., refinement, moral sensibility) are denied to an outgroup. People that suffer animalistic dehumanization are seen as amoral, unintelligent, and lacking self-control, and they are likened to animals. This has happened to Jewish people during The Holocaust, and indigenous people subject to colonization and slavery. While usually employed on an intergroup basis, animalistic dehumanization can occur on an interpersonal basis as well.\n\nThe mechanistic form occurs when features of human nature (e.g., cognitive flexibility, warmth, agency) are denied to targets. Targets of mechanistic dehumanization are seen as cold, rigid, interchangeable, lacking agency, and likened to machines or objects. Mechanistic dehumanization is usually employed on an interpersonal basis (e.g., when a person is seen as a means to another's end).\n\nSeveral lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization. Infrahumanization suggests that individuals think of and treat outgroup members as \"less human\" and more like animals; while Irenaus Eibl-Eibesfeld uses the term \"pseudo-speciation\", a term that he borrowed from the psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, to imply that the dehumanized person or persons are being regarded as not members of the human species. Specifically, individuals associate secondary emotions (which are seen as uniquely human) more with the ingroup than with the outgroup. Primary emotions (those that are experienced by all sentient beings, both humans and other animals) and are found to be more associated with the outgroup. Dehumanization is intrinsically connected with violence. Often, one cannot do serious injury to another without first dehumanizing him or her in one's mind (as a form of rationalization.) Military training is, among other things, a systematic desensitization and dehumanization of the enemy, and servicemen and women may find it psychologically necessary to refer to the enemy as animal or other non-human beings. Lt. Col. Dave Grossman has shown that without such desensitization it would be difficult, if not impossible for someone to kill another human, even in combat or under threat to their own lives.\n\nDelegitimization is the \"categorization of groups into extreme negative social categories which are excluded from human groups that are considered as acting within the limits of acceptable norms and/or values.\"\n\nMoral exclusion occurs when outgroups are subject to a different set of moral values, rules, and fairness than are used in social relations with ingroup members. When individuals dehumanize others, they no longer experience distress when they treat them poorly. Moral exclusion is used to explain extreme behaviors like genocide, harsh immigration policies, and eugenics, but can also happen on a more regular, everyday discriminatory level. In laboratory studies, people who are portrayed as lacking human qualities have been found to be treated in a particularly harsh and violent manner.\n\nMartha Nussbaum (1999) identified seven components of objectification: \"instrumentality\", \"denial of autonomy\", \"inertness\", \"fungibility\", \"violability\", \"ownership\", and \"denial of subjectivity\".\n\nIn Psychology higher-order cognitive processes like social cognition may occur between a human and human, or human and non-human, human and object. The assigning that occurs in social cognition suggests a non-human target can have projected internal life, or conscious emotional and cognitive experiences. Mental states projected onto objects and non-human forms of life can occur without intention. Studies by Heberlein, Adolphs, Tranel & Damasio, Heberlein AS, Adolphs R, Tranel D, Damasio H. Cortical regions for judgments of emotions and personality traits from point-light walkers explore the constants of biological motion perception within areas of the human brain, where participants would infer intent among objects which do not have any emotion or cognitions. It is also possible for subjects to anthropomorphize a spectrum of inanimate objects and non-human life forms. In children there is a common pattern of projecting the imaginary other, both humanlike and not, and a child is able to interact with the imaginary other without much effort as if the projected other exists. With the ease of anthropomorphic projection, children's lack of social cognition unto human counterparts is surprising. Dehumanized perception often means a cognitive bias experienced through lack of consideration for thoughts, feelings, and general mental contents of a social target's cognition. This dehumanized perception can occur when the target has elicited disgust or further negative responses when in contact with the dehumanizing subject. Humans seen as having certain lower social standings such as people suffering from addictions and homeless persons are often perceived as being low in cognitive warmth and low in social competency reliability. This often elicits more frequent disgust compared to certain higher social standings when projected cognitions by the dehumanizing subject. Humans can suddenly consider the mental cognitions of those persons who experience emotions of a social variety, linking in-groups of positive social figures to pride, connecting in-groups of wealthy and the upper class feelings of envy, and experiencing pity towards in-groups of the disabled and the elderly. Through a study by Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick in 2007, a stereotype content model showed that social targets such as the elderly and wealthy were trustworthy, friendly, and of capable ability due to perceived competence and warmth. However, in-groups of the disabled, poor, persons with addictions, and immigrants were recorded as disgust-inducing due to projected low warmth and incompetence.\n\nDehumanized perception has been indicated to occur when a subject experiences low frequencies of activation within their social cognition neural network. This includes areas of neural networking such as the superior temporal sulcus and the medial prefrontal cortex. A study by Frith & Frith in 2001 suggests the criticality of social interaction within a neural network has tendencies for subjects to dehumanize those seen as disgust-inducing leading to social disengagement. Tasks involving social cognition typically activate the neural network responsible for subjective projections of disgust-inducing perceptions and patterns of dehumanization. \"Besides manipulations of target persons, manipulations of social goals validate this prediction: Inferring preference, a mental-state inference, significantly increases MPFC and STS activity to these otherwise dehumanized targets.\" A 2007 study by Harris, McClure, van den Bos, Cohen & Fiske suggest a subject's mental reliability towards dehumanizing social cognition due to the decrease of neural activity towards the projected target, replicating across stimuli and contexts.\n\nWhile social distance from the outgroup target is a necessary condition for dehumanization, some research suggests that it is not sufficient. Psychological research has identified high status, power, and social connection as additional factors that influence whether dehumanization will occur. If being an outgroup member was all that was required to be dehumanized, dehumanization would be far more prevalent. However, only members of high status groups associate humanity more with ingroup than the outgroup. Members of low status groups exhibit no differences in associations with humanity. Having high status makes one more likely to dehumanize others. Low status groups are more associated with human nature traits (warmth, emotionality) than uniquely human traits, implying that they are closer to animals than humans because these traits are typical of humans but can be seen in other species. In addition, another line of work found that individuals in a position of power were more likely to objectify their subordinates, treating them as a means to one's own end rather than focusing on their essentially human qualities. Finally, social connection, thinking about a close other or being in the actual presence of a close other, enables dehumanization by reducing attribution of human mental states, increasing support for treating targets like animals, and increasing willingness to endorse harsh interrogation tactics. This is surprising because social connection has documented benefits for personal health and well-being but appears to impair intergroup relations.\n\nNeuroimaging studies have discovered that the medial prefrontal cortex—a brain region distinctively involved in attributing mental states to others—shows diminished activation to extremely dehumanized targets (i.e., those rated, according to the stereotype content model, as low-warmth and low-competence, such as drug addicts or homeless people).\n\nDehumanization often occurs as a result of conflict in an intergroup context. Ethnic and racial others are often represented as animals in popular culture and scholarship. There is evidence that this representation persists in the American context with African Americans implicitly associated with apes. To the extent that an individual has this dehumanizing implicit association, they are more likely to support violence against African Americans (e.g., jury decisions to execute defendants). Historically, dehumanization is frequently connected to genocidal conflicts in that ideologies before and during the conflict link victims to rodents/vermin. Immigrants are also dehumanized in this manner. In the 1900s, the Australian Constitution and British Government partook in an Act to federate the Australian states. Section 51 (xxvi) and 127 were two provisions that dehumanised Aboriginals.\n51. The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:\n(xxvi) The people of any race, other than the Aboriginal people in any state, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. \n127. In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a state or other part of the Commonwealth, Aboriginal natives shall not be counted.\nIn 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act was passed, this categorically denied Aboriginals from the right to vote. Indigenous Australians were not allowed social security benefits e.g. Aged pensions and maternity allowances. However, these benefits were provided to other non-Indigenous Australians by the Commonwealth Government. Aboriginals in rural areas were discriminated and controlled as to where and how they could marry, work, live, and their movements were restricted.\n\nFredrickson and Roberts argued that the sexual objectification of women extends beyond pornography (which emphasizes women's bodies over their uniquely human mental and emotional characteristics) to society generally. There is a normative emphasis on female appearance that causes women to take a third-person perspective on their bodies. The psychological distance women may feel from their bodies might cause them to dehumanize themselves. Some research has indicated that women and men exhibit a \"sexual body part recognition bias\", in which women's sexual body parts are better recognized when presented in isolation than in the context of their entire bodies, whereas men's sexual body parts are better recognized in the context of their entire bodies than in isolation. Men who dehumanize women as either animals or objects are more liable to rape and sexually harass women and display more negative attitudes toward female rape victims.\n\nSociologists and historians often view dehumanization as essential to war. Governments sometimes represent \"enemy\" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder. Dictatorships use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, sectarian, or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of media, presenting \"enemies\" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for colonialism.\n\nThe Holocaust during World War II and the Rwandan Genocide have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like lynching (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.\n\nAnthropologists Ashley Montagu and Floyd Matson famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered \"the fifth horseman of the apocalypse\" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society. When people become things, the logic follows, they become dispensable, and any atrocity can be justified.\n\nDehumanization can be seen outside of overtly violent conflicts, as in political debates where opponents are presented as collectively stupid or inherently evil. Such \"good-versus-evil\" claims help end substantive debate (see also thought-terminating cliché).\n\nNon-state actors—terrorists in particular—have also resorted to dehumanization to further their cause and assuage pangs of guilt. The 1960s terrorist group Weather Underground had advocated violence against any authority figure, and used the \"police are pigs\" idea to convince members that they were not harming human beings, but simply killing wild animals. Likewise, rhetoric statements such as \"terrorists are just scum\", is an act of dehumanization.\n\nA study investigating racialized law enforcement violence is using virtual simulators to investigate \"shoot or don't shoot\" responses. The studies conducted that participants' responses were affected by racial bias. When the simulator presented an armed Black man, participants shot faster and more accurately compared to an armed White man. In response to the \"don't shoot\", command of an unarmed Black man participant's reaction time was slower and less accurate compared to an unarmed White man. The Center of Disease Control statistics on law enforcement killings between 1999 and 2011 showed that American youth of African ancestry between the ages of 15 and 19 are 2.8 times more likely to be killed by law enforcement than the national average of all races and age groups. A study conducted with predominately White female undergraduates as well as predominately White male law enforcement found that participants overestimated the age of American children of African ancestry by 4.59 years, translating to boys of thirteen and a half years of age would be misperceived as legal adults. Annually, 250,000 children are processed through to adult correctional facilities; this is at the impairment of their physical and mental health. In comparison to children at juvenile facilities, children sentenced as adults are, five times as likely to be sexually assaulted, twice as likely to be assaulted by a correctional officer, and eight times as likely to commit suicide. Implied dehumanization estimated the inclination of excessive force used by law enforcement against American suspect of African ancestry compared to other races. The work of Herbert Kelman, \"Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizes\", illustrates how the above dehumanization of Americans with African ancestry is occurring. The apprehension towards murdering human beings is so overwhelming that the victim must be removed from their human status if systematic murdering is to occur. The victims are then dehumanized by placing them \"outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply\", the principle of mortality is no longer applicable. To establish others as entirely human, signify the sorrow from their death, despite racial background, as well as our individual relationship with the person. When referring to identity, the death is individualized; when referring to community, the death is experienced personally. The involvement of the bureaucratic apparatus is one of dehumanization.\n\nIn the United States of America, Americans of African ancestry were dehumanised via the classification of being deemed as a primate, not a human. The United States of America Constitution that took place in 1787 stated when collecting census data \"all other persons\" in reference to enslaved Africans will be counted as three-fifths of a human being. In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved. A California police officer who was also involved in the Rodney King beating described a dispute between an American couple with African ancestry as \"something right out of gorillas in the mist\". Franz Boas and Charles Darwin hypothesized that there may be an evolution process among primates. Monkeys and apes were least evolved, then savage and/ or deformed anthropoids which referred to people of African ancestry, to Caucasians as most evolved.\n\nRelatively recent history has seen the relationship between dehumanization and science result in unethical scientific research. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Nazi human experimentation on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently institutional review boards exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.\n\nIn a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the Dark Ages (see History of anatomy), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted. Dehumanization has been associated with modern medicine generally, and specifically, has been suggested as a coping mechanism for doctors who work with patients at the end of life. Researchers have identified six potential causes of dehumanization in medicine: deindivudating practices, impaired patient agency, dissimilarity (causes which do not facilitate the delivery of medical treatment), mechanization, empathy reduction, and moral disengagement (which could be argued, do facilitate the delivery of medical treatment).\n\nFrom the patient point of view, in some states in America, controversial legislation requires that a woman view the ultrasound image of her fetus before being able to have an abortion. Critics of the law argue that simply seeing an image of the fetus humanizes it, and biases women against abortion. Similarly, a recent study showed that subtle humanization of medical patients appears to improve care for these patients. Radiologists evaluating X-rays reported more details to patients and expressed more empathy when a photo of the patient's face accompanied the X-rays. It appears that inclusion of the photos counteracts the dehumanization of the medical process.\n\nDehumanization has applications outside traditional social contexts. Anthropomorphism (i.e., perceiving in nonhuman entities mental and physical capacities that reflect humans) is the inverse of dehumanization, which occurs when characteristics that apply to humans are denied to other humans. Waytz, Epley, and Cacioppo suggest that the inverse of the factors that facilitate dehumanization (e.g., high status, power, and social connection) should facilitate anthropomorphism. That is, a low status, socially disconnected person without power should be more likely to attribute human qualities to pets or electronics than a high-status, high-power, socially connected person.\n\nResearchers have found that engaging in violent video game play diminishes perceptions of both one's own humanity and the humanity of the players who are targets of the violence in the games. While the players are dehumanized, the video game characters that play them are likely anthropomorphized.\n\nDehumanization has occurred historically under the pre-tense of \"progress in the name of science\". During the St. Louis World's fair in 1904 human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes around the globe, most notably a young Congolese man, Ota Benga. Benga's imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing “a degraded and degenerate race”. During this period religion was still the driving force behind much political and scientific action, and because of this, eugenics were widely supported among the most notable US scientific communities, political figures, and industrial elites. After allocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.\n\nIn Martin Luther King Jr.'s book on civil rights \"Why We Can't Wait\", he explains \"Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race.\"\n\nMi'kmaq elder and human rights activist Daniel N. Paul has researched written extensively of historic accounts of atrocious acts of violence against First Nations peoples in North America. His work states European colonialism in Canada and America was a subjugation of the indigenous peoples and is an unequivocal violent series of crimes against humanity which has been unparalleled historically. Tens of millions First Nations died at the hands of European invaders in an attempt to appropriate the entirety of the land. Those hundreds of diverse civilizations and communities who thrived across North America millions of years before the exploits of Christopher Columbus were ultimately destroyed. Dehumanization occurred in the form of barbaric genocidal processes of murder, rape, starvation, enslavement, allocation, and germ warfare. Of the myriad of ways the English performed ethnic cleansing, one of the most frequent was the practice of bounty hunting and scalping—where colonial conquerors would raid communities and remove the scalps of children and adults. This war crime of scalping was most prevalent when maritime colonialists repeatedly attempted to eradicate Daniel N. Paul's ancestors, the Mi'kmaq. Scalping was common practice in many United States areas all the way until the 1860s in attempt to completely wipe out the remaining First Nations.\n\nCompton's cafeteria riot predates the stonewall riots of 1969 and marks one of the first times in American history that non-hetero-normative peoples denied their oppressors taking agency by demanding human rights. This incident was a result of the rampant discrimination, abuse, and ultimately, dehumanizing acts of violence against the LGBT community in the tenderloin district of San Francisco. Up until the Compton cafeteria riot, the act of dressing in non-gender binary clothing was considered a criminal offence, and police would respond to \"cross-dressers\" with frequent violence and misconduct. Accounts of frequent sexual assault, police brutality, abuse of power, and constant arrests by local law enforcement towards those seeking refuge in the ghettos of the tenderloin have been told in the documentary \"Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton’s Cafeteria.\"\n\nGerman philosopher and anthropologist of law Axel Montenbruck wrote that dehumanization is inextricably linked with both the \"techniques of neutralization\" (David Matza/Gresham Sykes) and to the obedience aspects of the Milgram experiment and in a wider sense with Philip Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment.\n\nMontenbruck continues that—in light of our common Western civilization—dehumanization is based on political Humanism, in terms of both human rights and Western democracy. Each of them are grounded in the \"dignity of man\" aspect. Therefore, its \"negation\" might be seen as dehumanization in our common Western sense. Furthermore, in light democracy, criminal law might be reduced to the simple formula: violating a person means an act of dehumanization by taking \"freedom, unfairly and inhumanely\". The reaction of a civilized Western society ought to be \"taking freedom as well, but fair and humane\".\n\nDehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, and political alignment. Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often light-skinned people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. \"Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal. There is no other classification that I’m aware of where the individual is being rendered as illegal as opposed to the actions of that individuals.\"\n\nA series of examinations of language sought to find if there was a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., \"faggot\") were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.\n\nFrancisco Goya, famed Spanish painter and printmaker of the romantic period often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization. In the romantic period of painting martyrdom art was most often a means of deifying the oppressed and tormented, and it was common for Goya to depict evil personalities performing these unjust horrible acts. But it was revolutionary the way the painter broke this convention by dehumanizing these martyr figures. \"…one would not know whom the painting depicts, so determinedly has Goya reduced his subjects from martyrs to meat.\"\n\nThe propaganda model of Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky argues that corporate media are able to carry out large-scale, successful dehumanization campaigns when they promote the goals (profit-making) that the corporations are contractually obliged to maximise. In both democracies and dictatorships, state media are also capable of carrying out dehumanization campaigns, to the extent with which the population is unable to counteract the dehumanizing memes.\n\n"}

The precise meaning of \"structure-preserving\" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which \"X\" and \"Y\" are instances. In the terminology of category theory, a structure-preserving map is called a morphism.\n\nThe fact that a map is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a \"hooked arrow\" (); thus: formula_1 (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for inclusion maps.)\n\nGiven \"X\" and \"Y\", several different embeddings of \"X\" in \"Y\" may be possible. In many cases of interest there is a standard (or \"canonical\") embedding, like those of the natural numbers in the integers, the integers in the rational numbers, the rational numbers in the real numbers, and the real numbers in the complex numbers. In such cases it is common to identify the domain \"X\" with its image \"f\"(\"X\") contained in \"Y\", so that .\n\nIn general topology, an embedding is a homeomorphism onto its image. More explicitly, an injective continuous map formula_2 between topological spaces formula_3 and formula_4 is a topological embedding if formula_5 yields a homeomorphism between formula_3 and formula_7 (where formula_7 carries the subspace topology inherited from formula_4). Intuitively then, the embedding formula_2 lets us treat formula_3 as a subspace of formula_4. Every embedding is injective and continuous. Every map that is injective, continuous and either open or closed is an embedding; however there are also embeddings which are neither open nor closed. The latter happens if the image formula_7 is neither an open set nor a closed set in formula_4.\n\nFor a given space formula_4, the existence of an embedding formula_16 is a topological invariant of formula_3. This allows two spaces to be distinguished if one is able to be embedded in a space while the other is not.\n\nIn differential topology:\nLet formula_18 and formula_19 be smooth manifolds and formula_20 be a smooth map. Then formula_5 is called an immersion if its derivative is everywhere injective. An embedding, or a smooth embedding, is defined to be an injective immersion which is an embedding in the topological sense mentioned above (i.e. homeomorphism onto its image). \n\nIn other words, an embedding is diffeomorphic to its image, and in particular the image of an embedding must be a submanifold. An immersion is a local embedding (i.e. for any point formula_22 there is a neighborhood formula_23 such that formula_24 is an embedding.)\n\nWhen the domain manifold is compact, the notion of a smooth embedding is equivalent to that of an injective immersion.\n\nAn important case is formula_25. The interest here is in how large formula_26 must be for an embedding, in terms of the dimension formula_27 of formula_18. The Whitney embedding theorem states that formula_29 is enough, and is the best possible linear bound. For example the real projective space RP of dimension formula_27, where formula_27 is a power of two, requires formula_29 for an embedding. However, this does not apply to immersions; for instance, RP can be immersed in formula_33 as is explicitly shown by Boy's surface—which has self-intersections. The Roman surface fails to be an immersion as it contains cross-caps.\n\nAn embedding is proper if it behaves well with respect to boundaries: one requires the map formula_34 to be such that\n\n\nThe first condition is equivalent to having formula_39 and formula_40. The second condition, roughly speaking, says that \"f\"(\"X\") is not tangent to the boundary of \"Y\".\n\nIn Riemannian geometry:\nLet (\"M,g\") and (\"N,h\") be Riemannian manifolds.\nAn isometric embedding is a smooth embedding \"f\" : \"M\" → \"N\" which preserves the metric in the sense that \"g\" is equal to the pullback of \"h\" by \"f\", i.e. \"g\" = \"f\"*\"h\". Explicitly, for any two tangent vectors \n\nwe have \n\nAnalogously, isometric immersion is an immersion between Riemannian manifolds which preserves the Riemannian metrics.\n\nEquivalently, an isometric embedding (immersion) is a smooth embedding (immersion) which preserves length of curves (cf. Nash embedding theorem).\n\nIn general, for an algebraic category \"C\", an embedding between two \"C\"-algebraic structures \"X\" and \"Y\" is a \"C\"-morphism that is injective.\n\nIn field theory, an embedding of a field \"E\" in a field \"F\" is a ring homomorphism .\n\nThe kernel of \"σ\" is an ideal of \"E\" which cannot be the whole field \"E\", because of the condition . Furthermore, it is a well-known property of fields that their only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole field itself. Therefore, the kernel is 0, so any embedding of fields is a monomorphism. Hence, \"E\" is isomorphic to the subfield \"σ\"(\"E\") of \"F\". This justifies the name \"embedding\" for an arbitrary homomorphism of fields.\n\nIf σ is a signature and formula_43 are σ-structures (also called σ-algebras in universal algebra or models in model theory), then a map formula_44 is a σ-embedding iff all of the following hold:\n\nHere formula_55 is a model theoretical notation equivalent to formula_56. In model theory there is also a stronger notion of elementary embedding.\n\nIn order theory, an embedding of partial orders is a function F from X to Y such that:\n\nIn domain theory, an additional requirement is: \n\nA mapping formula_59 of metric spaces is called an \"embedding\"\n(with distortion formula_60) if \nfor some constant formula_62.\n\nAn important special case is that of normed spaces; in this case it is natural to consider linear embeddings. \n\nOne of the basic questions that can be asked about a finite-dimensional normed space formula_63 is, \"what is the maximal dimension formula_64 such that the Hilbert space formula_65 can be linearly embedded into formula_3 with constant distortion?\"\n\nThe answer is given by Dvoretzky's theorem.\n\nIn category theory, there is no satisfactory and generally accepted definition of embeddings that is applicable in all categories. One would expect that all isomorphisms and all compositions of embeddings are embeddings, and that all embeddings are monomorphisms. Other typical requirements are: any extremal monomorphism is an embedding and embeddings are stable under pullbacks.\n\nIdeally the class of all embedded subobjects of a given object, up to isomorphism, should also be small, and thus an ordered set. In this case, the category is said to be well powered with respect to the class of embeddings. This allows defining new local structures in the category (such as a closure operator). \n\nIn a concrete category, an embedding is a morphism \"ƒ\": \"A\" → \"B\" which is an injective function from the underlying set of \"A\" to the underlying set of \"B\" and is also an initial morphism in the following sense:\nIf \"g\" is a function from the underlying set of an object \"C\" to the underlying set of \"A\", and if its composition with \"ƒ\" is a morphism \"ƒg\": \"C\" → \"B\", then \"g\" itself is a morphism.\n\nA factorization system for a category also gives rise to a notion of embedding. If (\"E\", \"M\") is a factorization system, then the morphisms in \"M\" may be regarded as the embeddings, especially when the category is well powered with respect to \"M\". Concrete theories often have a factorization system in which \"M\" consists of the embeddings in the previous sense. This is the case of the majority of the examples given in this article.\n\nAs usual in category theory, there is a dual concept, known as quotient. All the preceding properties can be dualized.\n\nAn embedding can also refer to an embedding functor.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58476264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58476264", "title": "Fisheries-induced evolution", "text": "Fisheries-induced evolution\n\nFisheries-induced evolution (FIE) is the microevolution of an exploited aquatic organism's population, brought on through the artificial selection for biological traits by fishing practices. Fishing, of any severity or effort, will impose an additional layer of mortality to the natural population equilibrium and will be selective to certain genetic traits within that organism's gene pool. This removal of selected traits fundamentally changes the population gene frequency, resulting in the artificially induced microevolution by the proxy of the survival of untargeted fish and their propagation of heritable biological characteristics. This artificial selection often counters natural life-history pattern for many species, such as causing early sexual maturation, diminished sizes for matured fish, and reduced fecundity in the form of smaller egg size, lower sperm counts and viability during reproductive events. These effects can have prolonged effects on the adaptability or fitness of the species to their environmental factors. \n\nFisheries-induced evolution differ to the norm Darwinian evolution model by the direct human factor. For FIE, fishing enforces a greater selection pressure for traits, often through sheer effort and catch numbers, which can disparage natural selection pressures such as predator-prey interactions and environmental influences. \n\nFishing practices that permanently remove animals from their population (i.e. not catch and release) drive direct fisheries-induced evolution by removing the genetic materials of those animals from the population. Individuals that are untargeted, through the selection bias of fishing gears and/or legislation, are allowed to reproduce and proliferate their genetic materials. As fishing pressures persist, traits belonging to non-selected organisms are preserved through survival and become more dominant in frequency within the gene pool. Additionally, fishing on a targeted species incur knock-on effects to those around it by its disturbance of their natural interactions. In these situations, specific traits of the untargeted species may be favourable under the diminutive presence, or absence, of the targeted species, and therefore indirectly selected for. \n\nThe direct selection for biological traits through fishery practices is the result of fishery management regulations, and gear restrictions and selectivities. The most obvious artificial selection for traits through management legislation can be observed in the imposed regulations on size, sex, seasonality, and locations. \n\nCatch size regulations vary with specificity to the targeted species and is often used to prevent exploitation during a specific part of the life cycle for the organism. Such regulations arose in response to the effects of FIE observed by the fisheries of Atlantic Cod (\"Gadus morhua\"). Prior to the fishing technological revolution that has lead to the species moratorium, the exploitation of Atlantic Cod have been selective towards larger-sized fish since the 1500s. Catch data for the species have quantitatively shown that this selectivity for larger fish for over 500 years have shifted the life-history patterns, resulting in earlier sexual maturation and smaller sizes at said maturation. \n\nSexual selectivity by a fishery works on the theoretical foundation that the preservation of females allows their reproductive input to offset the fishing mortality. Fisheries of species with low fecundity such as mud crabs (\"Scylla serrata\") and blue swimmer crabs (\"Portunus armatus\") often adopt this method and only allow the harvesting of males. The direct selection for traits, with respect to sex selectivity, occurs when specific characteristics or behaviours increase the susceptibility of the organisms for harvest. For example, corking wrasses (\"Symphodus melops\") are harvested as a biological control for sea lice within farmed salmon facilities of the northern hemisphere. Male fish dominate these wild fisheries in both catch per unit effort and weight owing to their strong nesting behaviour and territorial nature, which differentiate them from females and sneaker males. Persistent fishing pressures over the years have reduced maturation age and size for these nesting males, in addition to increasing the density of sneaker males to the detriment of the localised population. \n\nIndirect fishery-induced evolution occurs when a species with some level of ecological significance is targeted by a fishery, and their diminished presence within the ecology causes a flow on effect to other untargeted species. Keystone or umbrella species provide many ecological services to the environment which they belong to, ranging from the provision of habitat and food, to the control of biodiversity by preventing any one organism from dominating. Removal or reduction of these organisms often cause significant changes to the behaviours and physiology of the organisms which were once controlled. \n\nNon-migratory reef sharks (\"Carcharhinus melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos,\" and \"Triaenodon obesus\") play the vital role in weeding out sick and ill-adapted individuals from within a population, in addition to controlling the abundance of larger size fish. Thus, these sharks are an ever-present mortality factor for many reef organisms. Fisheries targeting these apex predators inherently allow for the proliferation of medium-sized predatory fishes (e.g. barracudas, juvenile groupers, trevallies, snappers) at the expense of the cohabiting smaller species. When this happen, the FIE responses observed from smaller species have been consistent with their increasing egg production and shifted life-history for early sexual maturation.\n\nAnother example of FIE that is instigated indirectly can be seen in the ornamental or aquarium trade industry. In particular, corals and anemones are highly prized ornamental commodities and are often harvested at unsustainable rates for profit within the Malay archipelago. Removal of anemones at rates higher than their resettlement into the reefs, as observed in the Philippines, is known to have caused drastic reduction in the localised population of clownfish or anemonefish (\"Amphiprion sp.\"). Evolutionarily, anemone fish observed on reefs that were subjected to intense and prolonged anemone fishing were significantly smaller, even for mature adult pairs, than those found living with an anemone. This size reduction is attributed to their need to hide in small coral crevices in the absence of a host.\n\nOutside of observational data collected from active fisheries, the evidence for fisheries-induced evolution, or its symptoms, may be discerned through both commercial and recreational anecdotes. These stories often articulate the diminishing catch, reduction in their weight and length records, in addition to the mandatory increase to fishing efforts over time to attain similar fishing quotas to their historical references. However, experimental data was needed to clarify two fundamental questions regarding FIE, so that the aforementioned ramifications of smaller sizes and early maturation may not be attributed to non-anthropogenic factors such as population flux. The two evidentiary questions: a) Is fishing pressure capable of changing the gene frequency of a population to cause microevolution within such a short time frame? b) How can non-selective fishing gears (gill nets and trawlers) be selective for certain traits? \n\nThe implementation of aquaculture experimental designs afford the possibility of isolating different biological traits and observing their impacts and heredity within a population. \n\nA study by Solberg et al. (2013) demonstrated that with sufficient fishing pressure and selectivity, a substantial change to a population genotype may be achieved without the geological time-frame often associated with evolution. In this study, Atlantic salmon (\"Salmo salar\") were subjected to a modified 'common garden' design, and the researchers isolated stress as an abiotic independent variable to the growth rates of salmon. By selecting for fish with a lower biological response to stress, a domesticated population was created within 10 generations of breeding, which exhibited a threefold increase in growth rate over its wild counterpart. Thus, the difference between the absence of larger fish, which can be misattributed to overfishing, and FIE lies in the inherited biological characteristics that were untargeted by fishing. \n\nFishing techniques such as gill nets and trawling are often associated with a lack of selectivity within the environment which they are operated. It is difficult to establish whether selectivity can occur under these practices, when fishing data suggest that an entire localised population may be caught or up to 80% of the effort to go to bycatches and not the targeted species. An experiment by Biro and Post (2008) shows that despite being mechanically unselective of gill nets, behavioural variation in certain fish species can indeed affect the likelihood of them being caught and therefore be a function for selectivity. Using a ‘selection experiment in the field’ model, two genotypes of rainbow trouts (\"Oncorhynchus mykiss\") were transplanted into identical artificial lake habitats and subjected to matching gill net fishing pressures. The net in question were designed to capture all size variability within the simulated populations. Trouts exhibiting the genotypes for faster growth rates and therefore a more active lifestyle were found to have a 60% increase chance to be caught in comparison to those characterised by the more sedentary genotype. Therefore, for 'non-selective' fishing methods, the selecting factor rests not on the gear itself but on the inherent behavioural variations within the population.\n\nFisheries-induced evolution is a function of the fishing-induced genetic drift, and to some extent represent the reduction of genetic diversity within the targeted population. For many exploited population, this reduction in genetic diversity has been predicted to reduce their adaptability to both environmental variability and ecological competitiveness. Indeed, the commonly observed fisheries-induced adaptation of younger and smaller size at sexual maturation counter specific life-history characteristics that would enable interspecies competition for resources. A biological model by Kindsvater and Palkovacs (2017) shows that FIE Atlantic cod, due to their smaller sizes, actually belong to a lower trophic level irrespective of their original position prior to the species moratorium. Furthermore, the FIE effect of reducing egg counts and their viability have weakened the number of recruitments back into the population after spawning, thereby reducing the localised population density. However, at the reduced population abundance and smaller sizes, the increase in \"per capita\" resource has been stipulated to counteract the effects of competitions between different species by reducing intraspecific interactions, which can allow for maximal density-dependent growth to happen. This also means that for harvesting to be sustainable, yearly or seasonal assessment of viable reproductive stocks and their recruitment rates must be performed to account for the compromised fecundity and recovery statuses. \n\nThere is limited data on the interactions between FIE affected species and their robustness to environmental fluctuations. For many species, the additional mortality rate and the frequency of harvesting exerted by the fisheries make it difficult to elucidate how environmental factors such as temperatures, salinity and currents can be beneficial or detrimental for stocks, since their effects on deaths or recruitment gains are diminutive in comparison. However, with the rapidly evolving climates stemming from the anthropogenic inputs, an understanding of how FIE affects the adaptability of these aquatic population will be necessary, not only for future stock assessments, but also sustainable harvesting. \n"}

The apparent abstraction of his paintings, films, and installations is anchored by specific archival sources: 17th-century kimono designs, avant-garde typography, WWI military uniform patterns, cartography, Latin American textiles, and early dance notations. Through the selection, reduction, rearrangement, and reproduction of his source materials—unsystematic and subjective modes of transcription—the artist arrives at a vocabulary that is at once abstract and semiotically motivated.\n\nPumhösl’s compositions establish points of contact with realms traditionally consigned to the margins of modern art. Through attention to the social, political, and geographic genealogy of given forms, his works reveal that the modernist fantasy of complete self-referentiality was always already haunted by irreducible specificity and cultural instability. “I am calling into question to what extent it is possible to act within a space defined by the artist himself – a space that emerges from the hierarchy between my own authorship and its research sources, between historical references or concrete borrowings and what I can depict,” Pumhösl states. “My medium is the physical and historical space that I create using painting, architecture, film or photography.”\n\nSolo exhibitions of Pumhösl's work have been staged at Kunsthaus Bregenz (2012); Mumok (Vienna, 2011); Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen (Düsseldorf, 2010); Musée d’Art Moderne Grand-Duc Jean (Luxembourg, 2009), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam, 2008); Neue Kunsthalle St. Gallen (2005); Centre d’édition contemporaine (Geneva, 2004); Kölnischer Kunstverein (Cologne, 2003); Secession (Vienna, 2000); and Salzburger Kunstverein (1998), among others. His work was featured in Documenta 12 (Kassel, 2007), São Paulo Biennial (2006) and the 50th Venice Biennale (2003). In 2015, his work was included in \"Parasophia: Kyoto International Festival of Contemporary Culture\" in Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art (2015). In 2012, he exhibited his work in Parcours, a two-person show at The Art Institute of Chicago with Liz Deschenes.

{"id": "48253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48253", "title": "Fractal art", "text": "Fractal art\n\nFractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and media. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards. It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art. The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.\n\nFractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of fractal-generating software, iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other graphics programs are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork. The Julia set and Mandelbrot sets can be considered as icons of fractal art.\n\nIt was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the calculative capabilities they provide. Fractals are generated by applying iterative methods to solving non-linear equations or polynomial equations. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.\n\nThere are many different kinds of fractal images and can be subdivided into several groups. \n\nFractal Expressionism is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as self-similarity for example. Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in Jackson Pollock's dripped patterns. They have been analysed and found to contain a fractal dimension which has been attributed to his technique.\n\nFractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s. Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from mainstream culture. Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation and landscape generation.\n\nFractals are sometimes combined with evolutionary algorithms, either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the Electric Sheep project, where people use fractal flames rendered with distributed computing as their screensaver and \"rate\" the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.\n\nMany fractal images are admired because of their perceived harmony. This is typically achieved by the patterns which emerge from the balance of order and chaos. Similar qualities have been described in Chinese painting and miniature trees and rockeries.\n\nThe first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of \"Scientific American\", August 1985. This image showed a landscape formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) Mandelbrot set. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a plateau atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in \"The Beauty of Fractals\" by Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form formula_1.\n\nNotable fractal artists include Desmond Paul Henry, Hamid Naderi Yeganeh and musician Bruno Degazio. The British artist William Latham, has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works. Greg Sams has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts and textiles. American Vicky Brago-Mitchell has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. Scott Draves is credited with inventing flame fractals. Carlos Ginzburg has explored fractal art and developed a concept called \"homo fractalus\" which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal. Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art. \nKerry Mitchell wrote a \"Fractal Art Manifesto\", claiming that\n\nAccording to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, \"fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART.\"\n\nMore recently, American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\n\nFractal art has been exhibited at major international art galleries. One of the first exhibitions of fractal art was \"Map Art\", a travelling exhibition of works from researchers at the University of Bremen. Mathematicians Heinz-Otto Peitgen and Michael M. Richter discovered that the public not only found the images aesthetically pleasing but that they also wanted to understand the scientific background to the images.\n\nIn 1989, fractals were part of the subject matter for an art show called \"Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos\" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art. The show consisted of photographs, installations and sculptures designed to provide greater scientific discourse to the field which had already captured the public's attention through colourful and intricate computer imagery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "162025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162025", "title": "Gender identity", "text": "Gender identity\n\nGender identity is the personal sense of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it. All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. Some people do not identify with some, or all, of the aspects of gender assigned to their biological sex; some of those people are transgender, genderqueer or non-binary. There are some societies that have third gender categories.\n\nCore gender identity is usually formed by age three. After age three, it is extremely difficult to change, and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria. Both biological and social factors have been suggested to influence its formation.\n\nThere are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence. John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three. It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three. At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys), although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender. After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change, and attempts to reassign it can result in gender dysphoria. Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age, and continues into young adulthood.\n\nMartin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this \"peak of rigidity,\" fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat. Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning gender role standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.\n\nAccording to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.\n\nAlthough the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as \"nature versus nurture\". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels. While genetic makeup also influences gender identity, it does not inflexibly determine it.\n\nSocial factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family, authority figures, mass media, and other influential people in a child's life. When children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles, they are more likely to behave in the same way, matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns. Language also plays a role: children, while learning a language, learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles. The social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors, and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way, thus being shaped by the people surrounding them through trying to imitate and follow them.\n\nA well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of David Reimer, otherwise known as \"John/Joan\". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct. This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.\n\nSeveral prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity. The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.\n\nHormonal influences are also complex; sex-determining hormones are produced at an early stage of foetal development, and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.\n\nHormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with \"women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.\"\n\nA survey of the research literature from 1955–2000 suggests that more than one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic. An intersex human or other animal is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \"do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies\". An intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child's future gender identity. Reinforcing sex assignments through surgical and hormonal means may violate the individual's rights.\n\nA 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised 46,XY persons with penile agenesis, cloacal exstrophy of the bladder, or penile ablation, found that 78% of the study subjects were living as female, as opposed to 22% who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex. The study concludes: \"The findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood, but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens.\"\n\nA 2012 clinical review paper found that between 8.5% and 20% of people with intersex variations experienced gender dysphoria. Sociological research in Australia, a country with a third 'X' sex classification, shows that 19% of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an \"X\" or \"other\" option, while 52% are women, 23% men, and 6% unsure. At birth, 52% of persons in the study were assigned female, and 41% were assigned male.\n\nA study by Reiner & Gearhart provides some insight into what can happen when genetically male children with cloacal exstrophy are sexually assigned female and raised as girls, according to an 'optimal gender policy' developed by John Money: in a sample of 14 children, follow-up between the ages of 5 to 12 showed that 8 of them identified as boys, and all of the subjects had at least moderately male-typical attitudes and interests, providing support for the argument that genetic variables affect gender identity and behavior independent of socialization.\n\nSome studies have investigated whether or not there is a link between biological variables and transgender or transsexual identity. Several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex. In particular, the bed nucleus of a stria terminalis or BSTc (a constituent of the basal ganglia of the brain which is affected by prenatal androgens) of trans women is similar to cisgender women's and unlike men's. Similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women. Another study suggests that transsexuality may have a genetic component.\n\nResearch suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity. Different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth, and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender.\n\nIn 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood. Money's hypothesis has since been discredited, but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation. In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence, with a 2004 article noting that \"solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking.\" A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.\n\nIt has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.\n\nParents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles. Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine. However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy. Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity, with Kane stating that \"the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity.\"\n\nMany parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as ultrasound. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions. Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.\n\nWhen considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class \"professional\" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.\n\nWithin a study conducted by Hillary Halpern it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.\n\nGender identity can lead to security issues among individuals that do not fit on a binary scale. In some cases, a person's gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.\n\nIn recent decades it has become possible to reassign sex surgically. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see transsexual for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe terms \"gender identity\" and \"core gender identity\" were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender — sometime in the 1960s. To this day they are usually used in that sense, though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the sexual orientation and sexual identity categories \"gay\", \"lesbian\" and \"bisexual\".\n\nIn late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called \"inverts\", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a \"dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework\". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their \"correct\" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.\n\nIn 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in \"Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\", giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).\n\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of homosexuality (which was viewed as a mental disorder at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the UCLA Medical Center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst Robert Stoller generalized many of the findings of the project in his book \"Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity\" (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term \"gender identity\" to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in 1963. Behavioral psychologist John Money was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at Johns Hopkins Medical School's Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book \"Man and Woman, Boy and Girl\" (1972) became widely used as a college textbook, although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Judith Butler began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published \"Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity\", introducing the concept of gender performativity and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.\n\n, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of conversion therapy, which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective. In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the NHS, have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.\n\nOn the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.\n\nTranssexual self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.\n\nIn the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that health insurance exchanges would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the LGBT community.\n\nGender dysphoria (previously called \"gender identity disorder\" or GID in the DSM) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant dysphoria (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex: \"In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.\" The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example gender identity disorder in children (for children who experience gender dysphoria).\n\nThe concept of gender identity appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in its third edition, DSM-III (1980), in the form of two psychiatric diagnoses of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the DSM-III-R, added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder. In 2013, the DSM-5 renamed the diagnosis \"gender dysphoria\" and revised its definition.\n\nThe authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a mental disorder, speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial, although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.\n\nThe Yogyakarta Principles, a document on the application of international human rights law, provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that \"Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity.\" and Principle 18 states that \"Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed.\" Relating to this principle, the \"Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles\" observed that \"Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected gender expression, have been treated as a form of mental illness. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including electroshock therapy — as a 'cure'.\" The \"Yogyakarta Principles in Action\" says \"it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration.\" These Principles influenced the UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity\nIn 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.\n\nSome people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a binary in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms \"non-binary\" or \"genderqueer\". Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from \"man\" and \"woman.\" These are often referred to as \"third genders\".\n\nIn some Polynesian societies, fa'afafine are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (\"see references\"), fa'afafine in Samoa at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against. Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.\nThe Samoan Prime Minister is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association. Translated literally, fa'afafine means \"in the manner of a woman.\"\n\nIn some cultures of Asia, a hijra is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically male or intersex, but some are anatomically female. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes prostitutes, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to transvestites or drag queens of contemporary western culture.\n\nThe khanith form an accepted third gender in Oman. The khanith are male homosexual prostitutes whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at weddings or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their society, khaniths can marry women, proving their masculinity by consummating the marriage. Should a divorce or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.\n\nMany indigenous North American Nations had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond cisgender man and woman, are now often collectively termed \"two-spirit\" or \"two-spirited.\" There are parts of the community that take \"two-spirit\" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.\n\n\n"}

Glassings can occur at bars or pubs where alcohol is served and such items are readily available. The most common method of glassing involves the attacker smashing an intact glass in the face of the victim. However, the glass may be smashed before the attack, and then gripped by the remaining base of the glass or neck of the bottle with the broken shards protruding outwards. Glassing is easily prevented by using containers made from plastic or tempered glass instead, but they suffer from unpleasant feel (plastic) and higher expense (for tempered glass). These alternative containers are slowly being adopted in areas with a high frequency of glassing, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. In New Zealand, a similar phenomenon is referred to as \"bottling\".\n\nCommon injuries resulting from glassings are heavy blood loss, permanent scarring, disfigurement and loss of sight through ocular injury. In the United Kingdom, there are more than 87,000 glassing attacks per year, resulting in over 5,000 injuries. Glassing is a relatively small portion of all alcohol-related violence, constituting 9% of injuries from alcohol-related violence in New South Wales, from 1999 to 2011, for instance.\n\nIn 2000, following a series of glassing attacks in Manchester, Greater Manchester Police and the Manchester Evening News launched a campaign \"Safe Glass Safe City\" promoting the use of toughened glass in pubs and clubs to prevent such attacks.\n\nAt least three states in Australia are addressing glassing incidents by introducing regulations for liquor-licensed venues.\n\nNew South Wales introduced many restrictions in 2008, including the removal of glass after midnight for high-risk venues. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of glassings.\n\nIn response to glassing violence, the government of Western Australia in 2011 made recommendations to the state hospitality industry on the use of tempered glass in hotels. The state government and the Australian Hotels Association created a self-regulatory program on the rollout of tempered glass in pubs, with most hotels and bars expected to change over to tempered beer glasses in six to 12 months. Royal Perth Hospital's head of plastic surgery Mark Duncan-Smith described it as an important step in protecting the public.\n\nIn relation to continuing glassing incidents despite limited glass bans in Queensland, Australia, state Liquor Licensing Minister Paul Lucas in 2011 predicted that almost all Queensland pubs and clubs would be (standard) glass-free in 10 years.\n\n"}

The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the 317th Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on 4 December 1950, when the General Assembly declared resolution 423(V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.\n\nThe day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. In addition it is traditionally on 10 December that the five-yearly United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize are awarded. Many governmental and non-governmental organizations active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organizations.\n\nHuman Rights Day is the day in 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe formal inception of Human Rights Day dates from 1950, after the Assembly passed resolution 423(V) inviting all States and interested organizations to adopt 10 December of each year as Human Rights Day. The popularity of the day can be shown by the fact that the commemorative Human Rights Day stamp issued by the United Nations Postal Administration in 1952, received approximately 200,000 advance orders.\n\nWhen the General Assembly adopted the Declaration, with 48 states in favor and eight abstentions, it was proclaimed as a \"common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\", towards which individuals and societies should \"strive by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance\". The measure was received by both advocates and critics alike as \"being more declarative than legislative, more suggestive than binding.\"\n\nAlthough the Declaration with its broad range of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights is not a binding document, it inspired more than 60 human rights instruments which together constitute an international standard of human rights. Today the general consent of all United Nations Member States on the basic Human Rights laid down in the Declaration makes it even stronger and emphasizes the relevance of Human Rights in our daily lives.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the main United Nations rights official, and his Office play a major role in coordinating efforts for the yearly observation of Human Rights Day:\n\nThe 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights occurred on 10 December 2008, and the UN Secretary-General launched a year-long campaign leading up to this anniversary. Because the UDHR holds the world record as the most translated document (except for the Bible), organizations around the globe used the year to focus on helping people everywhere learn about their rights.\n\nOn 9 December 2001, President George W. Bush made a Presidential proclamation that Human Rights Week began on 9 December. He also made the same proclamation on 10 December 2008.\n\nIn South Africa, Human Rights Day is celebrated on 21 March, in remembrance of the Sharpeville massacre which took place on 21 March 1960. This massacre occurred as a result of protests against the Apartheid regime in South Africa. South African Human Rights Day was declared a national holiday when the ANC was elected as the government with Nelson Mandela as the first democratically elected leader. Parliament's role on this day is to empower the people so that the democratic processes becomes known to all South Africans.\n\nIt is celebrated on 11 December in Kiribati.\n\n\n"}

In the international law of human rights, it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to justice and redress. Impunity is especially common in countries that lack a tradition of the rule of law, suffer from corruption or that have entrenched systems of patronage, or where the judiciary is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special jurisdictions or immunities.\n\nThe amended \"Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights Through Action to Combat Impunity\", submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on 8 February 2005, defines impunity as:\n\nThe First Principle of that same document states that:\n\nTruth and reconciliation commissions are frequently established by nations emerging from periods marked by human rights violations – coups d'état, military dictatorships, civil wars, etc. – in order to cast light on the events of the past.

{"id": "43956277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43956277", "title": "International Abolitionist Federation", "text": "International Abolitionist Federation\n\nThe International Abolitionist Federation (IAF; ), founded in Liverpool in 1875, aimed to abolish state regulation of prostitution and fought the international traffic in women in prostitution. It was originally called the British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution.\n\nThe federation was active in Europe, the Americas, and the European colonies and mandated territories. It felt that state regulations encouraged prostitution while having the effect of enslaving women in prostitution.\nIt felt that the solution lay in moral education, empowerment of women through the right to acquire skills and work, and marriage.\nThe federation experienced opposition from the authorities in Europe and the colonies, who were unwilling to relinquish control, and from reformers who wanted to suppress traffic of women but were less concerned with their welfare.\nAfter World War I (1914–18), the IAF was involved in discussions about League of Nations conventions on the issues, and after World War II (1939–45), about United Nations conventions.\nIn later years, the main focus was on eliminating unjust regulations that violated women's rights.\n\nRegulation of prostitution in the 19th century typically consisted of policing, brothel licenses, red light districts, registration and forced medical examination of women in prostitution, and forced hospitalization of women in prostitution suffering from sexually transmitted diseases.\nAbuses included police corruption, registration of underage girls, forced registration of vulnerable women, debt bondage and other ways in which women in brothels were exploited, as well as regulations and other practices that prevented women from leaving prostitution. In the colonies and mandated territories, the regulations were often related to military conquest and control.\nThe English feminist Josephine Butler (1828–1906), who came from a family involved in the abolition of slavery, believed that forced vaginal examination of women suspected of prostitution violated their basic legal rights. She argued that women lacked sexual autonomy because they were excluded from higher education, professional training, and paid employment and therefore had to choose between marriage or prostitution. Either way, their condition was no different from that of a slave. \nButler published many articles on the subject.\nShe toured Europe in 1874 and 1875 to raise support for an international abolitionist movement.\nIn Italy she was able to talk with Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi.\n\nButler and the pastors and friends who joined her at first campaigned for the \"freedom and purity of our English Commonwealth\", with which \nthey alluded to the liberty of women and to morality and the family. They were against extra-marital sex but also against celibacy, which they felt leads to depravity.\nThe solution was marriage.\nIn 1882, Butler said, \"The best of the restrictions imposed by law is that which encourages and, if necessary, forces citizens of both sexes to practice self-respect.\"\n\nThe abolition campaign rested on two main arguments. The first was \"scientific evidence\" that state regulation was ineffective and even harmful.\nThe second was that regulation was unacceptable even it were effective in terms of administration and health because it violated human liberty.\nThe abolitionists supported the civil rights of women in prostitution and denied that the state had the right to organize prostitution.\nAbolitionists were against the abuses inherent in state regulations and against restrictions on the basic freedoms of women in prostitution, such as their right to freedom of movement and to voluntary medical examination.\nButler asserted that regulation deprived women of the rights bestowed by the Magna Carta and the writ of habeas corpus.\n\nThe abolitionists pointed out the double standard of contemporary sexual morality due to which women's bodies were policed and controlled but their male customers were not regulated.\nThey pointed out that this resulted in a double injustice \"because it is unjust to punish the sex who are the victims of a vice, and leave unpunished the sex who are the main cause both of its vice and its dreaded consequences\". Men both caused prostitution and enforced the system that shamed and punished the women who were its victims.\nThe IAF said, \"The social rehabilitation of prostitutes cannot solve the problem of prostitution unless other factors influence the causes of prostitution ... Too often prostitutes are subjected to a disguised form of imprisonment, on the pretext of rehabilitation, in spite of laws which do not state prostitution to be an offence.\"\nThe IAF felt that treating prostitution as a legal or tolerated institution was \"a hygienic mistake, a social injustice, a moral outrage, and a judicial crime\".\n\nThe abolitionists also thought the trafficking of women would be reduced by the abolition of state-regulated prostitution.\nThey were uneasy about cooperating on measures against the white slave traffic with governments that regulated prostitution because they saw the governments as hypocritical in maintaining a system that created demand for the trafficked women.\n\nIn the late 19th century, most IAF activists did not have the right to vote because women's suffrage only existed in very few countries.\nThey faced disapproval of open discussion of sexual matters by women. Their efforts to organize were sometimes countered by police repression.\nThe movement struggled to maintain coherence despite the different priorities and beliefs of its members and despite the continued expansion of the colonial and imperial system.\nThe IAF tried to be independent of any particular political, philosophical, religious, or ethnic ties but was in practice dominated by Europeans.\nThe federation often looked to socialists for support, stressing the economic causes of prostitution among women unable to find other employment.\n\nVarious groups in different countries agitated against sexual slavery in the 1870s.\nThey formed an international federation thanks to the activity of Josephine Butler and a few other feminist leaders.\nThe first meeting of the British branch was held in Liverpool in March 1875 and was attended by Italian representatives.\nThe movement soon spread to other European countries, to European colonies or client states (India, Egypt, and the Dutch East Indies), and to the Americas.\nA pan-European international congress with six or seven hundred attendees was held in Geneva from 17 to 22 September 1877.\nThe British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of the Government Regulation of Vice was established at this meeting.\n\nThe supporters of the federation included a range of women including doctors, religious reformers, and feminists who were also active in organizations such as the International Council of Women and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. The federation was also supported by liberal or socialist men.\nIt was one of the first unofficial international societies for social and legal reform.\nThe resolutions stressed the importance of self-control, denied that debauchery was inevitable, decried impurity in both men and women, and called for the police to ensure that decency be respected in the street. They also said that \"[c]ompulsory registration is an affront to liberty and to common law\". There was thus tension between the disapproval of extramarital relations and the demand for women's liberty.\nThe International Union of Friends of Young Women was founded at this congress. This was a Protestant association that gave assistance to emigrating girls and women in an effort to prevent their sexual exploitation.\n\nThe federation helped the national abolitionist organizations to communicate and make connections, but activity at the international level was difficult due to the profound differences between the different countries. These included \"[t]he differences of language, of national and social traditions, of the state of public opinion and of the laws—and above all, the differences in the status of women\".\nAt the international level, the focus had to be strictly on the repeal of state laws and regulations regarding prostitution.\n\nThe first annual conference of the federation was held in Paris from 24 to 25 September 1878 in a mood of optimism.\nJames Stansfeld (1820–1898), the general secretary, had been received by Émile Deshayes de Marcère, the French minister of the interior.\nThe second congress of the federation, held in Genoa from 27 September to 4 October 1880, was attended by Yves Guyot and Emilie and Auguste de Morsier. The resolutions of this congress show that the liberal position had triumphed. \nThere was no mention of repression of illicit sexuality, only demands for guarantees of individual liberty, the rule of law, and the abolition of the regulation of prostitution.\nThe British, Continental, and General Federation for the Abolition of Regulated Prostitution held its fifth conference in Geneva in 1889, where it solemnly denounced the international white slave trade.\nThe federation moved its headquarters to Geneva in 1898.\nIt became the International Abolitionist Federation in 1902.\n\nIn the 1870s Butler helped organize the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. \nThe Contagious Diseases Acts had extended British regulations of women in prostitution in military areas to cover the whole country.\nThe British, Continental and General Federation for the Abolition of Government Regulation of Prostitution: British Branch was formed in Liverpool on 19 March 1875.\nThe reformers used the name \"abolition\" as a reference to the earlier movement to abolish slavery, since they considered that state-regulated prostitution was a form of slavery of women.\nThe British branch was based in Liverpool and had an office in Westminster, London.\nJames Stansfeld was president, Josephine Butler secretary and Henry Wilson corresponding secretary. \nLater William Crosfield was made treasurer and James Stuart replaced Wilson.\n\nThe British association saw prostitution as part of the larger issue of social morality and the position of women.\nButler was also active in the suffrage movement.\nThe concept that regulation was acceptable in the colonies but not in Europe was completely rejected since the arguments against regulation were considered to be based on universal principles. British reformers also worked in Australia, Ceylon, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, India, Malta, Singapore and South Africa.\nIn 1886 the British Contagious Diseases Act was repealed, a victory for the abolitionists.\nThis was followed by a large meeting to which delegates came from Europe and America to \"consolidate the attack on regulation throughout the world\".\n\nAfter the Contagious Diseases Acts were repealed the branch concentrated on eliminating regulation of prostitution in the British Empire, and in India in particular. In 1890 it changed its name to the British Committee for the Abolition of the State Regulation of Vice in India and throughout the British Dominions.\nIn 1897 the branch re-launched the \"Shield\", a periodical that had supported repeal of the Contagious Diseases Act, after this act was re-enacted in India. In 1915 the branch merged with the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts to form the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene (AMSH).\nThe international abolitionist Alison Neilans (1884–1942) was the AMSH general secretary in the 1920s.\nThe AMSH was a member of the IAF.\n\nProtestant reformers in the Dutch Réveil movement were concerned about the spread of municipal regulation between 1852 and 1877. They published translations of Butler's writings, and ran asylums for women in prostitution. Their main leader was the Reverend Hendrik Pierson. He met Butler at the 1877 congress in Geneva and was persuaded to join the IAF despite his misgivings about the secular nature of the organization and the influence of socialist feminists.\nIn 1889 the Dutch Women's Union, which considered itself an offshoot of the IAF, had 3,000 members working for abolition of regulation and trying to prevent prostitution by assisting young women who were traveling. By the end of the 19th century the Dutch Women's Union had 5,000 members.\nThe feminist and physician Aletta Jacobs signed up to the cause of abolition.\nLater she was one of the founders of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance, \nPierson became president of the IAF in 1898.\n\nOn 15 November 1876 Albert Caise, a founder of the \"Journal des femmes\", launched a petitition that called for brothels to be closed, the vice squad abolished, laws passed against provocation on public streets, more dispensaries and the return of women in prostitution to the rule of common law. The petition also called for free, compulsory education and new regulation of women's work.\nButler saw Paris as \"the great Babylon.\"\nIn January 1877 Butler traveled to Paris with the main IAF representatives to launch a campaign against the actions of the vice squad, and spoke at various meetings. In her view the French Contagious Diseases Act, and the resulting \"French system,\" caused enslavement of women and encouraged male immorality. She was against the \"fetishism of socialist State worship\" as well as \"medical domination and legislative tyranny.\"\n\nIn an ordinance of 16 June 1879 the police authorized establishment of a French section of the British and Continental Federation, called the \"Association pour l'abolition de la prostitution réglementée\", with Victor Schœlcher (1804–1893) as president. The association included feminists, radicals and abolitionists.\nThe most active organizers of the French Association for the Abolition of Official Prostitution were the feminist leaders Maria Deraismes, Emilie de Morsier and Caroline de Barrau.\nJosephine Butler visited Paris in April 1880. A meeting on 10 April 1880 was attended by about 2,000 people, mostly of the lower classes, including leaders of the extreme left in Paris. \nThe speeches reflected the growing influence of the feminist movement.\n\nBy the end of 1896 the abolitionist movement on France was moribund. Some of the members left the British and Continental Federation and formed a new \"Ligue française pour le relèvement de la moralité publique\". The new league called for abolition of the vice squad and the regulations that dishonored the police, compromised the magistrates and established inequality between men and women. The league was also concerned with fighting alcoholism, the white slave trade, immoral literature and license on the streets.\n\nIn 1897 Butler visited France, and a group led by Auguste de Morsier initiated re-foundation of a French branch of the IAF. \nThe new organization was represented officially at the international abolitionist conference in London in 1898.\nBetween 1898 and 1907 the abolitionist movement in France revived, led first by Auguste de Morsier and then by Ghénia Avril de Sainte-Croix (1855–1939).\nIn this period the IAF gained fresh support from periodicals. The \"Revue de morale sociale\" was dedicated to abolition.\nA major conference was held in Lyons in 1901 at the height of the campaign.\n\nThe first effective chapter of the IAF in Germany was organized in 1880 in Berlin, led by Gertrude Guillaume-Schack.\nLiberal Protestant activists in Germany were in close contact with the IAF, and Ludwig Weber (1846–1922) was on the IAF executive commission until 1887. However, the conservative Protestants had difficulty with the dominant liberal view that an individual had the right to do whatever they wanted with their body as long as they did not harm or affect the rights of others.\nThe liberals thought the state should defend the rights of citizens but should not impose any particular religious or moral values, while the conservatives thought \"the state is the guardian of God's commandments.\" Conservatives were also unable to accept the outspoken role that women played in the IAF, feeling it was for men to take the initiative.\nIn 1898 local associations of the IAF were formed by German women in several cities to fight against brothels and police control over women in prostitution.\nIn 1899 Anna Pappritz (1861–1939) of Berlin met Butler at the International Women's Congress in London.\nThat year she founded and became chairperson of the Berlin branch of the IAF.\nAnna Pappritz and Katharina Scheven became the two most influential leaders of the German branch of the IAF (DZIAF).\nFrom 1902 to 1914 Pappritz and Scheven edited the DZIAF magazine \"Der Abolitionist\".\n\nThe pre-war campaign of the DZIAF was largely ineffective. \nAttempts to revise the laws related to prostitution were abandoned with the outbreak of World War I (1914–18).\nEventually the Weimar Republic (1919–33) passed the 1927 Law to Combat Venereal Disease, which abolished state regulation of prostitution.\nThe Berlin chapter of the IAF, later called the League for Protection of Women and Youth (\"Bund für Frauen- und Jugendschutz\"), was dissolved in 1933.\n\nBy the mid 1920s Australia had in practice been regulating prostitution in Queensland and Western Australia for decades, and was under growing international pressure to abolish these regulations. \nThe IAF significantly affected Australian policy and policing, although the country would resist signing the United Nations abolitionist conventions until the 1970s.\nThe question of trafficking was raised in Australia in 1927, with foreigners blamed. \nThe Attorney General's Department recommended deporting any foreign women in prostitution.\nHowever, although the IAF would not object to measures against men involved in trafficking, their position on excluding or repatriating foreign women in prostitution was less clear cut.\nRepressive measures meant \"The prostitute was being considered as a special class which could be driven from place to place.\" \nThe effect of forced repatriation was to cause considerable economic loss to the women, who arguably would have to work longer in prostitution as a result.\n\nIn some areas under the control of the European powers there were high levels of foreign women among the women in prostitution, but after World War I the number of European women declined in areas such as Indochina and the Levant. When the IAF secretary visited Beirut in 1931 she reported that 14% of registered women in prostitution were foreign.\nThe British branch of the IAF showed the clear connection between regulation and trafficking when it quoted the governor of Somaliland saying in 1936, \"It will be necessary to regulate in all centers of the Italian African colonies a sufficiently large and often renewed supply of white women of another quality than honest women. They must be white women but not Italian—Italian women of that class should never be allowed to pass the frontiers of our Empire: it is an elementary question of prestige in relation to the natives.\"\n\nAfter World War II (1939–45) anti-slavery organizations such as the IAF continued to document the traffic in women and girls for the purpose of prostitution or marriage, but operated at the \"bottom of the UN human rights hierarchy\".\nIn December 1947 representatives of the IAF were among those who provided input into drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nThe United Nations' 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was only ratified by a few states since most would have had to first change their laws related to prostitution.\n\nIn 1954, the British put forward a draft convention on slavery for the United Nations, which formed the basis for the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery.\nThe IAF was involved in discussions of the wording, as were other NGOs such as the Women's International Organization and the Anti-Slavery Society. The IAF was generally opposed to efforts that might weaken the language, which called for abolition of slavery as soon as possible.\nIn 1974, the UN Commission of Human Rights set up the Working Group on Slavery, in which the IAF participated.\nThe working group discussed female genital mutilation, which the IAF argued fitted the definition of slavery since the women affected had lost control of their bodies.\nSince the main support for the practice came from the mothers of the women, who were certainly not slaves, the working group eventually dropped the issue.\nIn 1985, the IAF provided information to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\nThe federation held its 29th international congress in September 1987 in Vienna, Austria.\nIn France it was associated with organizations that gave shelter and retraining to women in prostitution so they could enter a new occupation.\nThe IAF was involved in the formulation of the United Nations 2000 protocol on trafficking in persons, joining with organizations such as the US-based Coalition Against Trafficking in Persons and the European Women's Lobby. A compromise had to be made with anti-abolitionist NGOs and supporters of sex workers' rights, and the agreed formula therefore restricted the definition to cases involving coercion or deception. \nIt was extended to cover trafficking for other purposes, marking a shift from women's sexuality and morality to a focus on crime and working conditions.\n\nAuthorities in the European countries and their colonial territories often saw abolition of regulations as a threat to their authority.\nMale-led \"purity reformers\" also saw no need to protect the rights of women in prostitution.\nIn 1899 the purity reformers founded the International Bureau for the Suppression of the White Slave Traffic (later Traffic in Women and Children, then Traffic in Persons).\nThese later changes in name reflected shifts in focus to include non-white women and boys being trafficked for prostitution.\nThe International Bureau felt the state should have control over the sexual activities of which they disapproved, but avoided the question of regulation. Each national committee of the Bureau wanted to protect the women of their own country from export to foreign brothels, and to criminalize women imported from other countries.\nThe state authorities preferred to work with the International Bureau, which did not challenge their authority to prosecute unregistered women in prostitution and brothels, to import voluntary prostitutes and to deport foreign women in prostitution.\n\nThe movement also had to address women who thought regulations should be reformed rather than abolished. \nThese women, often from the upper classes, thought greater control of prostitution would reduce the health risks from sexually transmitted diseases, both for the men buying sex and for their wives, and reduced the risk of women being attacked by men unable to find an outlet for their sexual urges.\nThus Lady Henry Somerset, first vice-president of the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, advocated reforming regulations in India rather than abolishing them. \nIAF activists in all countries were consistently opposed to such a position.\nSupporters of regulation were able to show statements from women in prostitution that they felt safer in brothels than on the streets, health checks let them gain business by showing clients they had a clean bill of health, and government regulation removed the stigma of their occupation. Abolitionists said these were exceptional cases. Interviews by IAF and Women's Christian Temperance Union reformers in India in the late 19th century showed that women in prostitution serving the troops detested the compulsory medical checks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59563", "title": "Judicial independence", "text": "Judicial independence\n\nJudicial independence is the concept that the judiciary should be independent from the other branches of government. That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important to the idea of separation of powers.\n\nDifferent countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing judges. One way to promote judicial independence is by granting life tenure or long tenure for judges, which ideally frees them to decide cases and make rulings according to the rule of law and judicial discretion, even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.\n\nIn some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of judicial review. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional.\n\nJudicial independence serves as a safeguard for the rights and privileges provided by a limited constitution and prevents executive and legislative encroachment upon those rights. It serves as a foundation for the rule of law and democracy. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the judiciary's affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people's rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.\n\nThe effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference. The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.\n\nThe disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and interdependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One cannot be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. If the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.\n\nAlso, an extremely independent judiciary would lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or harm. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.\n\nConstitutional economics studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a market economy.\n\nIn some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.\n\nThe development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law. This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.\n\nA notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the Act of Settlement 1701. The second phase was evident when England’s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu’s separation of powers doctrine, and the Founding Fathers of the US Constitution used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution’s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence. Other common law countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.\n\nIn recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK, as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the European Convention on Human Rights in British law through the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force in the UK in 2000.\n\nWhere British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British Constitutional Reform Act 2005 marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the Lord Chancellor, one of the country’s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities. The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the House of Lords; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers. The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial Appellate Committee of the House of Lords from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the Supreme Court, and creating a Judicial Appointments Commission. The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.\n\nThus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in European Union law, in civil law countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.\n\nThe International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association's New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association's revision of its ethical standards for judges.\n\nIn recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.\n\nCanada has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its Constitution, awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the Constitution Act, 1867. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the Parliament of Canada (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in criminal law (but not civil law) by section 11 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, although in the 1986 case \"Valente v. The Queen\" it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.\n\nThe year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the Supreme Court of Canada in the Provincial Judges Reference found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.\nThere are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.\n\nIn Hong Kong, independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty registered with the United Nations, independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English common law, has been enshrined in the territory's constitutional document, the Basic Law.\n\nJudicial independence in Singapore is protected by the Constitution of Singapore, statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the common law. To safeguard judicial independence, Singapore law lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of Supreme Court judges may be discussed in Parliament and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.\n\nThe Chief Justice and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President of Singapore acting on the advice of the Cabinet of Singapore. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet's advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy security of tenure up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.\n\nDuring the middle ages, under the Norman monarchy of the Kingdom of England, the king and his Curia Regis held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the early modern period; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king's role in this feature of government became small. Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The Stuart dynasty used this power frequently in order to overpower the Parliament of England. After the Stuarts were removed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King William III approved the Act of Settlement 1701, which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.\n\nUnder the uncodified British Constitution, there are two important conventions which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of parliamentary privilege: that Members of Parliament are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.\n\nFurthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 aims to increase diversity among the judiciary.\n\nThe pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in \"good order,\" they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.\n\nUntil 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the Bar Council and the Law Society. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the Legal Services Board, composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the Legal Services Act 2007. This saw the establishment of the Solicitors Regulation Authority to regulate solicitors and the Bar Standards Board to regulate barristers.\n\nArticle III of the United States Constitution establishes the federal courts as part of the federal government.\n\nThe Constitution provides that federal judges, including judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, are appointed by the President \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Once appointed, federal judges:\n\nFederal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or impeachment and removal from office by Congress; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase \"during good behavior\" predates the Declaration of Independence. John Adams equated it with \"quamdiu se bene gesserint\" in a letter to the Boston Gazette published on 11 January 1773, a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1701 in England.\n\nThe President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the American Bar Association, whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee \"Well Qualified,\" \"Qualified\" or \"Not Qualified.\"\n\nState courts deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both trial courts and appellate courts (including state supreme courts), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some states, judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a nonpartisan one), while in others they are appointed by the governor or state legislature.\n\nThe 2000 case of \"Bush v. Gore\", in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of the George W. Bush then pending in the Florida Supreme Court, whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.\n\n\n"}

It is a special case of a more general result for symmetric spaces. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of , and for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all \"n\" by \"n\" complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ, ..., λ) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.\n\nKostant used this to generalize the Golden–Thompson inequality to all compact groups.\n\nLet \"K\" be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus \"T\" and Weyl group \"W\" = \"N\"(\"T\")/\"T\". Let their Lie algebras be formula_1 and formula_2. Let \"P\" be the orthogonal projection of formula_1 onto formula_2 for some Ad-invariant inner product on formula_1. Then for \"X\" in formula_2, \"P\"(Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\") is the convex polytope with vertices \"w\"(\"X\") where \"w\" runs over the Weyl group.\n\nLet \"G\" be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with \"K\" a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the identity component of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus \"G\"/\"K\" is a symmetric space of compact type. Let formula_7 and formula_1 be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of formula_7. Let formula_10 be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let formula_11 be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let \"Q\" be the orthogonal projection of formula_10 onto formula_11 for some Ad(\"K\")-invariant inner product on formula_10. Then for \"X\" in formula_11, \"Q\"(Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\") is the convex polytope with vertices the \"w\"(\"X\") where \"w\" runs over the restricted Weyl group (the normalizer of formula_11 in \"K\" modulo its centralizer).\n\nThe case of a compact Lie group is the special case where \"G\" = \"K\" × \"K\", \"K\" is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of \"G\" interchanging the two factors.\n\nKostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in . There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to : it is based on a generalization of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm to compact Lie groups.\n\nLet \"K\" be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus \"T\". For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into \"K\". A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if \"Y\" is in formula_1 and \"k\" varies in this image of SU(2), then \"P\"(Ad(\"k\")⋅\"Y\") traces a straight line between \"P\"(\"Y\") and its reflection in the root α. In particular the component in the α root space—its \"α off-diagonal coordinate\"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from \"P\"(\"Y\") to \"P\"(Ad(\"k\")⋅\"Y\") is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of \"Y\". Let \"m\" be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of \"K\"/\"T\". Starting from an arbitrary \"Y\" take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get \"Y\". Continue in this way, to get a sequence (\"Y\"). Then\n\nThus \"P\"(\"Y\") tends to 0 and\n\nHence \"X\" = \"P\"(\"Y\") is a Cauchy sequence, so tends to \"X\" in formula_2. Since \"Y\" = \"P\"(\"Y\") ⊕ \"P\"(\"Y\"), \"Y\" tends to \"X\". On the other hand, \"X\" lies on the line segment joining \"X\" and its reflection in the root α. Thus \"X\" lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by \"X\". These convex polytopes are thus increasing as \"n\" increases and hence \"P\"(\"Y\") lies in the polytope for \"X\". This can be repeated for each \"Z\" in the \"K\"-orbit of \"X\". The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of \"X\" and hence \"P\"(Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\") is contained in the convex polytope defined by \"W\"(\"X\").\n\nTo prove the opposite inclusion, take \"X\" to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points \"Y\" in the convex hull of \"W\"(\"X\") can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality \"X\" corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of \"K\" with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ.) Each part of the path from \"X\" to \"Y\" can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in \"P\"(Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\").\n\n gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in . For compact groups, and showed that if \"M\" is a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian action of a torus \"T\" with Lie algebra formula_2, then the image of the moment map\n\nis a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of \"T\" (the image is a finite set). Taking for \"M\" a coadjoint orbit of \"K\" in formula_23, the moment map for \"T\" is the composition\n\nUsing the Ad-invariant inner product to identify formula_23 and formula_1, the map becomes\n\nthe restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking \"X\" in formula_2, the fixed points of \"T\" in the orbit Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\" are just the orbit under the Weyl group, \"W\"(\"X\"). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices. gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.\n\nLet τ be the map τ(\"Y\") = − σ(\"Y\"). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad(\"K\")⋅\"X\". Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of \"T\" on Ad(\"G\")⋅\"X\", i.e. the points \"w\"(\"X\") for \"w\" in \"W\" = N(\"T\")/C(\"T\").\n\nIn the convexity theorem is deduced from a more general convexity theorem concerning the projection onto the component \"A\" in the Iwasawa decomposition \"G\" = \"KAN\" of a real semisimple Lie group \"G\". The result discussed above for compact Lie groups \"K\" corresponds to the special case when \"G\" is the complexification of \"K\": in this case the Lie algebra of \"A\" can be identified with formula_32. The more general version of Kostant's theorem has also been generalized to semisimple symmetric spaces by . gave a generalization for infinite-dimensional groups.\n\n"}
{"id": "26023412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26023412", "title": "Legality of the War on Drugs", "text": "Legality of the War on Drugs\n\nSeveral authors have put forth arguments concerning the legality of the War on Drugs. In his essay \"The Drug War and the Constitution\", Libertarian philosopher Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the Constitution.\n\nIn her dissent in \"Gonzales v. Raich\" (a case argued by Randy Barnett), Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that drug prohibition is an improper usurpation of the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the power to prohibit should be reserved by the states. In the same case, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a stronger dissent expressing a similar idea. Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined O'Connor's dissent.\n\nAnother argument against drug prohibition is based on the notion that its practice violates implicit rights within the substantive due process doctrine. It has been suggested that anti-drug laws do not achieve enough reasonable benefit to State interests to justify arbitrarily restricting basic individual liberties that are supposed to be guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. One proponent of this notion is attorney Warren Redlich.\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. State of Florida attempted to eliminate criminal intent as an element of the crime of drug possession. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that the Florida law was unconstitutional, saying that the elimination of the element of intent was \"atavistic and repugnant to the common law\". Nellie King, president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, explained the ruling in terms of due process. The ruling is subject to appeal.\n\nThe substantive due process argument is sometimes used in medical marijuana cases. NORML once wrote in an amicus brief on \"United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative\" that the right to use medical marijuana to save one's life is within the rights established by the substantive due process. However, the Supreme Court found against the medical marijuana dispensary and for the United States in the aforementioned case. Some apparently believe that this invalidates the substantive due process argument against the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court expressly \"declined\" to rule on the issue of substantive due process in the aforementioned case, ruling against the medical marijuana dispensary in question on grounds of statutory construction, as the Court found that there was no standalone medical necessity defense in the Controlled Substances Act. Justice Clarence Thomas' majority opinion clearly explains that the Court did not consider any Constitutional arguments in coming to the conclusion that it reached. As Justice Thomas expressly states in his majority opinion: \"Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statute exceeds Congress’ Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do so in the first instance.\" As such, the question of the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act under the doctrine of substantive due process remains an open one, undecided by the Supreme Court, and debated by the citizens of the United States.

She was a Quaker and a member of the American Woman Suffrage Association. Vernon was inspired by the methods used by the Women's Social and Political Union in Britain. Vernon was one of the principal members of the Congressional Union for Women Suffrage (CUWS) alongside Olympia Brown, Inez Milholland, Crystal Eastman, Lucy Burns, and Alice Paul, and helped to organize the Silent Sentinels protests that involved daily picketing of Woodrow Wilson's White House.\n\nMabel Vernon was born on September 19, 1883 in Wilmington, Delaware. She graduated from Wilmington Friends School in 1901. She went on to attend Swarthmore College where she was a year ahead of Alice Paul. Vernon graduated from Swarthmore in 1906. She then became a teacher at Radnor High School in Wayne, Pennsylvania where she taught Latin and German.\n\nVernon attended the 1912 convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, where she was an usher. She was the first paid organizer that Alice Paul recruited. Vernon joined Lucy Burns and Paul as part of NAWSA's Congressional Committee to organize the Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913 that was to occur the following March where it would coincide with the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. During the Summer of 1913, Vernon and Edith Marsden campaigned for suffrage in Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Long Island.\n\nIn 1914, Vernon organized for the Congressional Union, travelling through the Southwestern United States and making her way north through California before arriving in Nevada. An accomplished fundraiser, she assisted Anne Martin in Nevada, who was working for NAWSA on a referendum campaign. After Martin got into a debate with Senator Key Pittman, Anna Howard Shaw wrote her an angry letter accusing her of being duped by Vernon and the CU. Late in 1915, Vernon organized greeting parades ahead of Sara Bard Field, who was driving a petition with 500,000 signatures across the United States to be presented to President Woodrow Wilson in Washington D.C.\n\nAt a June 1916 convention in Chicago, women from states that had granted them the right to vote gathered to form the National Woman's Party. The Democratic Party had adopted a suffrage plank that advocated state's rights to choose suffrage, but continued to block national suffrage. Frustrated with the situation, Vernon interrupted President Woodrow Wilson during a speech he was giving at the dedication of the Labor Temple in Washington on July 4, querying, \"Mr. President, if you sincerely desire to forward the interests of all the people, why do you oppose the national enfranchisement of women?\" Wilson dismissed the question and when Vernon repeated the question again later, police ordered her to leave the meeting.\n\nVernon was a key organizer of the campaign of the Silent Sentinels that began in January 10, 1917. She was responsible for ensuring that there were enough volunteers each day to picket the White House. Vernon and Paul organized themed days for the picket where all of the volunteers were from certain states or from certain professions. Their strategy ensured consistent press coverage and the eighteen-month campaign saw thousands of women participate and culminated in the arrests of many picketers and the \"Night of Terror\".\n\nAt a convention in March 1917, it was decided to merge the Congressional Union and the National Woman's Party. Following the vote, Vernon was selected to be Secretary of the NWP. After President Wilson announced the American entry into World War I, a committee was able to secure an audience with Wilson on the issue of suffrage. Doris Stevens, in her memoir \"Jailed for Freedom\", wrote that the President was moved when Mabel Vernon said \"If the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government is so sacred a cause to foreign people as to constitute the reason for our entering the international war in its defense, will you not, Mr. President, give immediate aid to the measure before Congress demanding self-government for the women of this country?\"\n\nVernon was among the first six women who were arrested while picketing the White House, under charges of \"obstructing the traffic.\" They were tried and found guilty on June 26, 1917 and each was ordered to pay a 25 dollar fine or spend three days in jail. All of the women insisted they were innocent and refused to pay the fine. Following the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, during the 1920s, Vernon supported women candidates for Congress and lobbied on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nVernon went to Columbia University where she earned a master's degree in political science in 1924.\n\nIn 1930, Vernon turned her attention from the women's movement to focus on international relations and peace. She was a proponent of Latin American rights and disarmament. Vernon joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1930. She was director of the Peoples Mandate Committee for Inter-American Peace and Cooperation in the 1940s. She was a member of the Inter-American delegation to the foundation of the United Nations.\n\nBeginning in 1951, Vernon lived with her companion Consuelo Reyes-Calderon in Washington, D.C. Vernon died on September 2, 1975.\n\nIn the 2004 film \"Iron Jawed Angels\" she was portrayed by Brooke Smith. However, the film doesn't depict her being arrested and imprisoned: instead, she is shown managing the NWP during Alice Paul's incarceration, including working with lawyers on appeals for the suffragettes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "570963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=570963", "title": "Marginal propensity to save", "text": "Marginal propensity to save\n\nThe marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of an increase in income that is not spent on an increase in consumption. That is, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for saving. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.\n\nThe MPS plays a central role in Keynesian economics as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to Keynes it reflects the fundamental psychological law. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the multiplier.\n\nMPS can be calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.\n\nOr mathematically, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) function is expressed as the derivative of the savings (S) function with respect to disposable income (Y).\n\nNow, MPS can be calculated as follows:\n\nMPS = (Change in savings) / (Change in income)\n\nThis implies that for each additional one unit of income, the savings increase by 0.4.\n\nThere are different implications of this above-mentioned formula.\n\n\nSince MPS is measured as ratio of change in savings to change in income, its value lies between 0 and 1.\nAlso, marginal propensity to save is opposite of marginal propensity to consume.\n\nMathematically, in a closed economy, MPS + MPC = 1, since an increase in one unit of income will be either consumed or saved.\n\nIn the above example, If MPS = 0.4, then MPC = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.\n\nGenerally, it is assumed that value of marginal propensity to save for the richer is more than the marginal propensity to save for the poorer. If income increases for both parties by $1, then the propensity to save for a richer person would be more than that for the poorer person.\n\nMarginal propensity to save is also used as an alternative term for slope of saving line.\nThe slope of a saving line is given by the equation S = -a + (1-b)Y, where -a refers to autonomous savings and (1-b) refers to marginal propensity to save (here b refers to marginal propensity to consume but as MPC + MPS = 1, so (1-b) refers to MPS).\n\nIn this diagram, the savings function is an increasing function of disposable income i.e. savings increase as income increases.\n\nAn important implication of marginal propensity to save is measurement of the multiplier. A multiplier measures the magnified change in aggregate product i.e. the gross domestic product, resulting from a change in an autonomous variable (for example, government expenditure, investment expenditures, etc.).\n\nThe effect of a change in production creates a multiplied impact because it creates income which further creates consumption. However, the resulting consumption is also an expenditure which thus, generates more income, which creates more consumption. This next round of consumption leads to a further change in production, which generates even more income, and which induces even more consumption.\n\nAnd thus, as it goes on and on, it results in a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by a change in autonomous variable, but amplified by the creation of more income and increase in consumption.\n\nMathematically, the above effect can be stated as:\n\nAnd it goes on and on.\nWe can express this as:\n\nThe end result is a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by the change in investment, but amplified by the change in consumption i.e. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume).\n\nThe MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, but more consumption is induced, with each round of activity.\n\nThus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production due to change in an autonomous variable by $1\n\nThe effect of a multiplier effect can be measured as:\n\nIf the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, and more consumption is induced with each round of activity.\n\nFor example, if MPS = 0.2, then multiplier effect is 5, and if MPS = 0.4, then the multiplier effect is 2.5. Thus, we can see that a lower propensity to save implies a higher multiplier effect.\n\n\n"}

He disagreed with Lukes that Karl Marx underestimated the importance of values such as freedom of the press, writing that \"the effective use of such freedom rarely extended beyond the privileged strata of society\", and criticized Lukes for neglecting Marx's insight that capitalists and workers both behave through \"character masks.\" He concluded that, \"Despite its shortcomings, Lukes offers us a useful, though idiosyncratic vision of Marx's theory of morality.\"\n\nSwingewood described the book as \"a notable contribution to current debates on the problems of socialist ethics and moral theory\".

{"id": "33975919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33975919", "title": "Psychopolitical validity", "text": "Psychopolitical validity\n\nPsychopolitical validity was coined by Isaac Prilleltensky in 2003 as a way to evaluate community psychology research and interventions and the extent to which they engage with power dynamics, structural level of analysis, and promotion of social justice. The evaluative series of criteria developed by Prilleltensky may be used within any critical social science research and practice model, but can specifically be defined within community psychology research as advocating for a focus on well-being, oppression, and liberation across collective, relational, and personal domains in both research and practice.\n\nAn example of research that maintains psychopolitical validity is Bennett's study of Old Order Amish in Canada and their relationship with the state via cultural differences and industrial agriculture policies. Bennett's research investigates power dynamics between the state, mainstream culture, society, and the Amish community. This research looks at oppression and liberation at individual and community levels, and leads to local change as well as change in public policy.\n\nThe construct of psychopolitical validity runs in opposition to \"mainstream psychology's traditions [that] reinforce oppressive institutions even when individual psychologists have no such goal in mind,\". In addition this evaluation technique questions mainstream positivism. Psychopolitical validity asks the researcher and activist to think about power and how it affects fundamental epistemological and transformational values.\n\nPrilleltensky describes one component of psychopolitical validity as \"the degree to which research and action take into account power dynamics operating in psychological and political domains and in the interaction between them\". This inclusion of power and political dynamics is hypothesized to have the ability to move clinical and community psychology beyond helping the afflicted to helping change the systemic, structural sources of inequality that affect the population. Investigation and discussion of psychological and political dynamics may have the \"power to promote wellness, resist oppression, and foster liberation\".\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of psychopolitical validity lends itself to empowerment studies and social change. Prilleltensky and Fox suggest that psychopolitical validity should be institutionalized as a method of preventing wellness and justice from being discussed in isolation. This type of validity brings the two concepts together and politicizes the concept of wellness promotion.\n\n\"Definition\": \"Psychopolitical validity refers to the extent to which studies and interventions in the community integrate (a) knowledge with respect to multidisciplinary and multilevel sources, experiences, and consequences of oppression, and (b) effective strategies for promoting psychological and political liberation in the personal, relational, and collective domains.\"\n\nPsychopolitical validity is divided into two components: \"epistemic validity\" and \"transformational validity\".\n\nEpistemic validity uses both psychological and political dynamics when investigating social phenomena. Epistemic validity considers systemic factors and power in development and investigation of research questions and in thinking about the subsequent knowledge produced. When evaluating studies based on epistemic validity there is a focus on whether or not there is an effort to understand and take into account structural forces impacting a given issue. To be valid in this way, it is imperative that there is an understanding of how \"global, political, economic forces and social norms influence the perceptions and experiences of individuals and groups\".\n\n\"Definition\": \"Epistemic validity is concerned with the degree to which community research and action is attuned to issues of power at multiple levels of analysis (personal, relational, collective). The more systematic the analysis of the phenomenon of interest in terms of psychological and political power, the more valid is the critical research and action.\"\n\nPrilleltensky and Fox emphasize that epistemic psychopolitical validity measures the extent to which psychology research investigating wellness and justice imagines positive and negative political and psychological dynamics. \"Positive\" psychological dynamics can include qualities that vary on an individual level, i.e.: \"hope, empathy, optimism, attachment, and social support\". \"Negative\" forces include, for example, \"verbal abuse, stigmatization, or affective distortions\". Positive political forces are equitable resource distribution, human rights, maintenance of democracy, and access to civic participation, whereas negative forces include \"oppression, exploitation\", each of these being dependent on institutionalized power inequalities.\n\nTransformational validity measures the extent to which interventions use both politics and psychology to create structural change within society. Studies and interventions with high transformational validity are, for example, ones that promote psychopolitical literacy, educate on overcoming oppression, empower individuals and groups take action against injustice, and advocate for coalition building.\n\nTransformative validity also takes into account how positive and negative political and psychological forces can be changed through action.\n\n\"Definition\": \"Transformational validity … is concerned with the degree to which community research and action strives to transform social structures. The more transformative and the less ameliorative the intervention, the greater the transformational validity of the critical research and action.\"\n\nFisher and Sonn (2008) suggest that Prilleltensky fails to take cultural differences and diversity into account. Concepts imperative to any discussion of the importance of psychopolitical validity, such as \"wellness\", may not be useful across cultures, even across western cultures. They may not be easily conceptualized in cross-cultural context. In addition, they are skeptical of an uncritical rhetoric of democracy, which may fail to recognize other ways of social functioning or the ways democracy could potentially be flawed or misrepresented. Finally, Fisher and Sonn add that a strict and sole adherence to investigation and alleviation of oppression and promotion of liberation might prevent other areas of community psychology from growing.\n\n\n\n"}

The equivalent term Frauenraub, originally from German, is used in English in the field of art history.\n\nBride kidnapping is distinguished from \"raptio\" in that the former is the abduction of one woman by one man (and his friends and relatives), whereas the latter is the abduction of women by groups of men, possibly in a time of war.\n\nThe English word \"rape\" retains the Latin meaning in literary language, but the meaning is obscured by the more current meaning of \"sexual violation\". The word is akin to \"rapine\", \"rapture\", \"raptor\", \"rapacious\" and \"ravish\", and referred to the more general violations, such as looting, destruction, and capture of citizens, that are inflicted upon a town or country during war, e.g. the Rape of Nanking. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the definition \"the act of carrying away a person, especially a woman, by force\" besides the more general \"the act of taking anything by force\" (marked as \"obsolete\") and the more specific \"violation or ravishing of a woman\".\n\nEnglish \"rape\" was in use since the 14th century in the general sense of \"seize prey, take by force\", from \"raper\", an Old French legal term for \"to seize\", in turn from Latin \"rapere\" \"seize, carry off by force, abduct\". The Latin term was also used for sexual violation, but not always. It is contested that the legendary event known as \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\", while ultimately motivated sexually, did not entail sexual violation of the Sabine women on the spot, who were instead abducted, and then implored by the Romans to marry them (as opposed to striking a deal with their fathers or brothers first, as would have been required by law).\n\nThough the sexual connotation is today dominant, the word \"rape\" can be used in a non-sexual context in literary English. In Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\", the title means \"the theft of a lock [of hair]\", exaggerating a trivial violation against a person. In the twentieth century, the classically trained J. R. R. Tolkien used the word with its old meaning of \"seizing and taking away\" in his \"The Silmarillion\". The musical comedy \"The Fantasticks\" has a controversial song (\"It Depends on What You Pay\") about \"an old-fashioned rape\". Compare also the adjective \"rapacious\" which retains the generic meaning of greedy and grasping.\n\nIn Roman Catholic canon law, \"raptio\" refers to the legal prohibition of matrimony if the bride was abducted forcibly (Canon 1089 CIC).\n\nThe practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity. In Neolithic Europe, excavation of the Linear Pottery culture site at Asparn-Schletz, Austria, the remains of numerous slain victims were found. Among them, young adult females and children were clearly under-represented, suggesting that attackers had killed the men but abducted the nubile females.\n\nAbduction of women is a common practice in warfare among tribal societies, along with cattle raiding. In historical human migrations, the tendency of mobile groups of invading males to abduct indigenous females is reflected in the greater stability of Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups compared to Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. \n\nThe Rape of the Sabine Women is an important part of the foundation legends of Rome (8th century BC). Romulus had established the settlement on the Palatine Hill with mostly male followers. Seeking wives, the Romans negotiated with the neighboring tribe of the Sabines, without success. Faced with the extinction of their community, the Romans planned to abduct Sabine women. Romulus invited Sabine families to a festival of Neptune Equester. At the meeting he gave a signal, at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. The indignant abductees were implored by Romulus to accept Roman husbands. Livy claims that no sexual assault took place. He asserted that Romulus offered them free choice and promised civil and property rights to women. According to Livy he spoke to them each in person, \"and pointed out to them that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and—dearest of all to human nature—would be the mothers of free men.\" The women married Roman men, but the Sabines went to war with the Romans. The conflict was eventually resolved when the women, who now had children by their Roman husbands, intervened in a battle to reconcile the warring parties. The tale is parodied by English short-story writer Saki in \"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\".

This is assumed to represent the first lasting contact of the Goths with Christianity.\n\nIn the Qur'an, marriage to female prisoners of war who embraced Islam is recommended for those who cannot afford to marry other Muslim women according to Islamic law (Sura 4:25).\n\nMutual abduction of women between Christian and Muslim communities was common in the Balkans under Ottoman rule, and is a frequent theme in the Hajduk songs of the period.\n\n"}

Tory Higgins and Arie Kruglanski who are interested in the development of goal-pursuit as well as motivation. The theory depicts two main approaches to situations using locomotion and assessment.\n\nThe regulatory mode theory depicts how people approach situations to achieve the goal. This theory is part of E. Tory Higgins research in motivation theories and goal pursuit theories. People can either use the locomotion or the assessment method for goal-pursuit. E. Tory Higgins states, \"When people self-regulate they decide what they want that they don’t currently have. They then figure out what they need to do to get what they want, and then they do it.\" People who are geared towards the locomotion mode are focused on moving and getting things done. In contrast, those that are strong in assessment will compare different goals and analyze different options.\n\nA study done by Pierro, Giacomantonio, Pica, Kruglanski, and Higgins (2011) examined the ways locomotion and assessment affects procrastination and how people manage time. The study found that assessment is positively related to procrastination and locomotion is negatively related to procrastination. To reach a certain goal, assessors have to analyze and compare a large amount of work. However, the locomotors were generally quicker to make decisions and act on them. The study emphasized that assessment orientation evaluates and analyzes in such detail that they delay making the decision quickly. Yet for the assessment-oriented individuals, they were more accurate in their decisions even though they took a longer time. These two regulatory modes reflect motivational styles for goal-pursuit. The motivation behind the assessment mode is accuracy and for locomotion mode it is action.\n\nA person's regulatory mode is correlated with regulatory fitness. They display their optimal level of performance in addition to valuing the end goals. In Avnet and Higgin's study (2004), the participants paid more for the book-light when their decisions were based on their regulatory orientation—either locomotion or assessment. They demonstrated that the value of the book-light is dependent on their approach systems.\n\nConsequently, locomotion can be very efficient in maintaining attitude, creating intention, and facilitating behavior. Mannetti, Pierro, Higgins, and Kruglanski (2012) investigated peoples' commitment to exercising at the gym and how regularly they went. They evaluated the participants' regulatory mode using a questionnaire and then their attendance was recorded in a 6-month period. Results show that when the people had high locomotion concerns and they had positive attitudes about physical exercise, their intentions to engage in physical exercise were high. They would proceed to actually engage in physical exercise within the 6-month period. Since locomotion runs on the motivation to do and to act, the positive effects of making a behavior happen can be expanded to other areas.\n"}

This includes reenacting the event or putting oneself in situations where the event is likely to happen again. This \"re-living\" can also take the form of dreams in which memories and feelings of what happened are repeated, and even hallucination.\n\nThe term can also be used to cover the repetition of behaviour or life patterns more broadly: a \"key component in Freud's understanding of mental life, 'repetition compulsion' ... describes the pattern whereby people endlessly repeat patterns of behaviour which were difficult or distressing in earlier life\".\n\nSigmund Freud's use of the concept of \"repetition compulsion\" () was 'articulated ... for the first time, in the article of 1914, \"Erinnern, Wiederholen und Durcharbeiten\" (\"Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through\")'. Here he noted how 'the patient does not \"remember\" anything of what he has forgotten and repressed, he \"acts\" it out, without, of course, knowing that he is repeating it ... For instance, the patient does not say that he remembers that he used to be defiant and critical toward his parents' authority; instead, he behaves in that way to the doctor'.\n\nHe explored the repetition compulsion further in his 1920 essay \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\", describing four aspects of repetitive behavior, all of which seemed odd to him from the point of view of the mind's quest for pleasure/avoidance of unpleasure.\n\nThe first was the way 'dreams occurring in traumatic neuroses have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident' rather than, for example, 'show[ing] the patient pictures from his healthy past'.\n\nThe second came from children's play. Freud reported observing a child throw his favorite toy from his crib, become upset at the loss, then reel the toy back in, only to repeat this action. Freud theorized that the child was attempting to master the sensation of loss 'in allowing his mother to go away without protesting', but asked in puzzlement 'How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?'.\n\nThe third was the way (noted in 1914) that the patient, exploring in therapy a repressed past, 'is obliged to \"repeat\" the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of ... \"remembering\" it as something belonging to the past ... the compulsion to repeat the events of his childhood in the transference evidently disregards the pleasure principle in \"every\" way'.\n\nThe fourth was the so-called \"destiny neurosis\", manifested in 'the life-histories of men and women ... [as] an essential character-trait which remains always the same and which is compelled to find expression in a repetition of the same experience'.\n\nAll such activities appeared to Freud to contradict the organism's search for pleasure, and therefore 'to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that seems more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides': 'a daemonic current/trait', 'a daemonic character', a 'daemonic compulsion', likely alluding to the Latin motto \"errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum\" (\"to err is human, to persist [in committing such errors] is of the devil\"). Following this line of thought, he would come to stress that \"'an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things\"'; and so to arrive eventually at his concept of the death drive.\n\nAlong the way, however, Freud had in addition considered a variety of more purely psychological explanations for the phenomena of the repetition compulsion which he had observed. Traumatic repetitions could be seen as the result of an attempt to retrospectively \"master\" the original trauma, a child's play as an attempt to turn passivity into activity: 'At the outset he was in a \"passive\" situation ... but by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an \"active\" part'.\n\nAt the same time, the repetition of unpleasant experiences in analysis could be considered 'unpleasure for one system and simultaneously satisfaction for the other . In the second edition of 1921, he extended the point, stating explicitly that transference repetitions 'are of course the activities of instincts intended to lead to satisfaction; but no lesson has been learnt from the old experience of these activities having led only to unpleasure'.\n\nFive years later, in \"Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety\", he would quietly revise his earlier definition—'There is no need to be discouraged by these emendations ... so long as they enrich rather than invalidate our earlier views'—in his new formula on 'the power of the compulsion to repeat—the attraction exerted by the unconscious prototypes upon the repressed instinctual process'.\n\nIt was in the latter, psychological form that the concept of the repetition compulsion passed into the psychoanalytic mainstream. Otto Fenichel in his \"second generation\" compendium \"The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis\" stressed two main kinds of neurotic repetition.\n\nOn the one hand, there were \"'Repetitions of traumatic events for the purpose of achieving a belated mastery\" ... seen first and most clearly in children's games', although the 'same pattern occurs in the repetitive dreams and symptoms of traumatic neurotics and in many similar little actions of normal persons who ... repeat upsetting experiences a number of times before these experiences are mastered. Such traumatic repetitions could themselves appear in active or passive forms. In a passive form, one chooses his or her most familiar experiences consistently as a means to deal with problems of the past, believing that new experiences will be more painful than their present situation or too new and untested to imagine. In the active, participatory form, a person actively engages in behavior that mimics an earlier stressor, either deliberately or unconsciously, so that in particular events that are terrifying in childhood become sources of attraction in adulthood. For instance, a person who was spanked as a child may incorporate this into their adult sexual practices; or a victim of sexual abuse may attempt to seduce another person of authority in his or her life (such as their boss or therapist): an attempt at \"mastery\" of their feelings and experience, in the sense that they unconsciously want to go through the same situation but that it \"not\" result negatively as it did in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, there were \"'Repetitions due to the tendency of the repressed to find an outlet\"'. Here the drive of the repressed impulse to find gratification brought with it a renewal of the original defence: 'the anxiety that first brought about the repression is mobilized again and creates, together with the repetition of the impulse, a repetition of the anti-instinctual measures'. Fenichel considered that 'Neurotic repetitions of this kind contain no metaphysical element', and 'even the repetition of the most painful failure of the Oedipus complex in the transference during a psychoanalytic cure is not \"beyond the pleasure principle\"'.\n\nLater writers would take very similar views. Eric Berne saw as central to his work 'the repetition compulsion which drives men to their doom, the power of death, according to Freud ... [who] places it in some mysterious biological sphere, when after all it is only the voice of seduction'—the seduction of the repressed and unconscious id.\n\nErik Erikson saw the destiny neurosis—the way 'that some people make the same mistakes over and over'—in the same light: 'the individual unconsciously arranges for variations of an original theme which he has not learned either to overcome or to live with'. Ego psychology would subsequently take for granted 'how rigidly determined our lives are—how predictable and repetitive ... the same mistake over and over again'.\n\nObject relations theory, stressing the way 'the transference is a live relationship ... in the here-and-now of the analysis, repeating the way that the patient has used his objects from early in life' considered that 'this newer conception reveals a purpose ... [in] the repetition compulsion': thus 'unconscious hope may be found in repetition compulsion, when unresolved conflicts continue to generate attempts at solutions which do not really work ... [until] a genuine solution is found'.\n\nBy the close of the twentieth century, the psychoanalytic view of repetition compulsion had come into increasing dialogue with a variety of other discourses, ranging from attachment theory through brief psychodynamic therapy to cognitive behavioural therapy.\n\nAttachment theory saw early developmental experiences leading to 'schemas or mental representations of relationship ... [which] become organized, encoded experiential and cognitive data ... that lead to self-confirmation'.\n\nThe Core Conflictual Relationship Theme—'core wishes that the individual has in relation to others'—was seen in brief psychodynamic therapy as linked to the way in 'a repetition compulsion, the client will behave in ways that engender particular responses from others that conform with previous experiences in interpersonal relationships'.\n\nIn 'psychological schemas' described in social psychology or cognitive-behavioural psychology ... 'an enduring symbolic framework that organizes constellations of thought, feeling, memory, and expectation about self and others\" (Knapp 1991: 94)', further parallels may be seen to the role of early unconscious fixations in fueling the repetition compulsion.\n\n\n\n"}

A round is a process in a planetary chain, according to which a life cycle or life-wave of souls or monads begins its evolutionary journey on the first and most subtle or spiritual of the series of seven globes; then finishing its evolution there, proceeds to the next, and so on, to the densest or most manifest globe (usually called globe D), which in our case is the gross, physical Earth. From there it proceeds on the ascending arc, through increasingly more ethereal globes. Each of these globes are in coadunition with the physical earth, though they are not in consubstantiation with it. Each of these stages is called a \"round\", and during this time the reincarnating life wave has passed through seven Root Races.\n\nWhen the life wave has gone through all seven globes of the planetary chain, it has completed one \"planetary round\" or \"globe manvantara\". This is followed by the dissolution of the planetary chain in a nirvana (which is not the same as what Buddhism calls nirvana because it is not permanent); this period between physical manifestation is called pralaya in Hinduism. Finally, a new round begins, in which consciousness is now more developed than in the preceding round.\n\nSeven such planetary rounds (or forty-nine globe rounds) represents one kalpa or \"manvantara\" or \"day of Brahma\". This is followed by a higher \"nirvana\" or pralaya, which is the pralaya of that planetary chain. This lasts until a new planetary chain forms with its various life waves.\n\nSeven such planetary chains and their pralayas constitute a solar manvantara, after which the solar system is dissolved in a cosmic pralaya, before the cycle begins anew.\n\nThis elaborate cosmology, first formulated by Blavatsky, was also taught by de Purucker, Leadbeater, and Alice Bailey.\n\nRudolf Steiner retained the basic concept of root races and sevenfold cycles within cycles, but his description is considerably simpler, concentrating only on the seven cycles of the present Solar System. Each of these cycles constitutes a coming into being and passing out of being of the solar system, and each is divided into seven rounds, upon which man passes through seven root races. Each of Steiner's seven rounds is related to a metamorphosis of the Earth:\nFor Steiner, the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms represent \"cast off\" elements of the human entity from previous rounds. These teachings have been incorporated into the Anthroposophical Society that Steiner founded.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings about the scheme of evolution, in the beginning of a \"Day of Manifestation\" a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a Solar System for the evolution of added self-consciousness. In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of consciousness, from omniscience to an unconsciousness deeper than that of the deepest trance condition.\nDuring the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained to the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.\n\nThe period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called \"Involution\". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience, is called \"Evolution\". Every evolving being has within him a \"force\" within which makes evolution not to be a mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called \"Epigenesis\" provides the element of originality and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God.\n\nHeindel states that in the Solar system, God's Habitation, there are seven Worlds differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another. These Worlds have each a different \"measure\" and rate of vibration and are not separated by space or distance, as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of matter, of varying density and vibration (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical Earth). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin spirit becomes first human and, then, a God.\nThe highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually condense and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the nadir of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as evolution proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World. \n\n\n"}

The identity of the gift giver is a secret not to be revealed until after the gift is opened. \n\nDeriving from the Christian tradition, the ritual is known as \"Secret Santa\" in the United States and the United Kingdom; as \"Kris Kringel\" or \"Kris Kindle\" (\"Christkindl\") in Ireland; as \"Wichteln, Secret Santa\", \"Kris Kringle\", \"Chris Kindle\" (\"Christkindl\") or Engerl-Bengerl in parts of Austria; as \"Secret Santa\" or \"Kris Kringle\" in Canada and Australia; as \"Secret Santa\", \"Kris Kringle\", or \"Monito-monita\" in the Philippines; as \"Angelito\" in the Dominican Republic; and as \"Wichteln\" in Germany. \"Wichteln\" is what a \"Wichtel\", a wight, does, a good deed. In Poland, the tradition is celebrated on the day of 6 December (Mikołajki), in Ukraine — on December, 19th (Mykolay). All of these names derive from traditional Christmas gift-bringers: the American custom is named after Santa Claus, or St Nicholas (Poland and Ukraine), while \"Chris Kindle\" and \"Kris Kringle\" are both corruptions of the original name of the Austrian gift-bringer \"Christkindl\", which means the \"Christ Child\". Exceptions are the UK (where the traditional gift-bringer is Father Christmas) and the Philippines (which has the Three Kings). Spain, Portugal and most places in Latin America use \"amigo secreto\" (secret friend) or \"amigo invisible/invisível\" (invisible friend). In Israel, this game is called \"גמד וענק\" (A Dwarf and a Giant) and is mostly played during Purim.\n\nThe term \"Pollyanna\" is used in Southeastern Pennsylvania and South Jersey.\n\nIn this version, participants (players) bring one gift each which is potentially suitable or interesting to any of the other participants. The gifts should be wrapped in such a way as to disguise their nature. Ideally, the provider of each gift should not be disclosed when setting up the game. Players take turns, and can either open a new gift, or steal a previously opened gift. This game is more commonly known as the white elephant gift exchange, or Yankee Swap.\n\nEach participant brings a gift for their assigned person, with a letter. This letter may or may not have hints on who the giver might be, depending on the rules participants have established. Each receiver must guess who made the gift.\n\nIn this version, each person buys a gift for specific amount, not for anyone specifically. Each person also puts in a specific amount of money into a pot. Who goes first in gift selection can be determined by random selection. The options are:\n\n\nAt the end, the gifts that were chosen are opened and the winner of the money and leftover gifts are drawn.\n\nIn this version, participants engage in a \"conspiracy\" where all participants work together to select a gift for a single participant without that participant's direct involvement or knowledge. Many such individual \"conspiracies\" run concurrently, one for each participant. Email threads or web apps are commonly used to manage each \"conspiracy\" until a consensus is made, wherein the gift is purchased by a decided upon participant and given at a later date. A common theme of Conspiracy Santa is collectively learning about participants, making it popular for workplaces and schools.\n\nThe tradition of Secret Santa is becoming increasingly popular in online communities. \n\nOn the one hand there are several \"Secret Santa Generators\" that tell every participant in a group for whom to buy a gift.

{"id": "511068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511068", "title": "Self-serving bias", "text": "Self-serving bias\n\nA self-serving bias is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem, or the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner. It is the belief that individuals tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts, but ascribe failure to external factors. When individuals reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and failures, or take more responsibility for their group's work than they give to other members, they are protecting their ego from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but they also serve the self's need for esteem. For example, a student who attributes earning a good grade on an exam to their own intelligence and preparation but attributes earning a poor grade to the teacher's poor teaching ability or unfair test questions might be exhibiting the self-serving bias. Studies have shown that similar attributions are made in various situations, such as the workplace, interpersonal relationships, sports, and consumer decisions.\n\nBoth motivational processes (i.e. self-enhancement, self-presentation) and cognitive processes (i.e. locus of control, self-esteem) influence the self-serving bias. There are both cross-cultural (i.e. individualistic and collectivistic culture differences) and special clinical population (i.e. depression) considerations within the bias. Much of the research on the self-serving bias has used participant self-reports of attribution based on experimental manipulation of task outcomes or in naturalistic situations. Some more modern research, however, has shifted focus to physiological manipulations, such as emotional inducement and neural activation, in an attempt to better understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to the self-serving bias.\n\nThe theory of self-serving biases first came to attention in the late 1960s to early 1970s. As research on this topic continued to grow some people saw concerns. In 1971, fear emerged that the hypothesis would prove to be incorrect much like the perceptual defense hypothesis by Dixon. However, the theory now holds strong. When this theory was still being developed it was during the research of attribution bias. Fritz Heider found that in ambiguous situations people made attributions based on their own needs and in order to maintain a higher self-esteem and viewpoint. This specific tendency became what we now know as self-serving. Miller and Ross conducted a study in 1975 that was one of the earliest to assess not only self-serving bias but they looked at the attributions for successes and failures within this theory. They argued that the self-serving bias people create is rational and not dependent on one's need for self-esteem. This means that if the outcome of an event is consistent with the person's expectation, then they will make dispositional (internal) factors. On the other hand, if the outcome of the event doesn't match the person's expectations, they will make situational attributions by blaming their surroundings instead of themselves.\n\nInvestigations of the self-serving bias in the laboratory differ depending on the experimental goals, but have basic fundamental aspects. Participants perform some task, often of intelligence, social sensitivity, teaching ability, or therapy skills. Participants may be asked to work alone, in pairs, or in groups. After task completion, participants are given randomized bogus feedback. Some studies employ emotion-induction mechanisms to investigate moderating effects on the self-serving bias. Finally, participants make attributions for the given outcomes. These attributions are assessed by the researchers to determine implications for the self-serving bias.\n\nSome more modern testing employs neural imaging techniques to supplement the fundamental self-serving bias laboratory procedures. Neural correlates of the self-serving bias have been investigated by electroencephalography (EEG), as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These procedures allow for insight into brain area activity during exhibition of a self-serving bias, as well as a mechanism to differentiate brain activity between healthy and clinical populations.\n\nRetrospective performance outcomes can be used in investigation of the self-serving bias. An example of this is reported company performance followed up by self-report of outcome attributions. These self-report attributions can then be used to assess how successes and failures are viewed by company employees and executives. This method can be used for numerous outcome variables to determine the presence or absence of the self-serving bias.\n\nTwo types of motivation affect the self-serving bias: self-enhancement and self-presentation. Self-enhancement aims to uphold one's own self-worth, and attributing successes internally and failures externally helps individuals in their self-enhancement. Self-presentation refers to the drive to convey a desired image to others and make self-serving attributions to manage impressions. For example, they claim personal responsibility for successes but not failures in an attempt to influence how others perceive them. Motivation works in conjunction with cognitive factors to produce personally satisfying and self-preserving attributions for outcomes.\n\nLocus of control is one of the main influences of attribution style. Individuals with an internal locus of control believe that they have personal control over situations and that their actions matter. Those with an external locus of control believe that outside forces, chance, and luck determine situations and that their actions cannot change anything. Individuals with an external locus of control are more likely to exhibit a self-serving bias following failure than those with an internal locus of control. The difference in attribution style between individuals with internal and external loci of control, however, is not as marked in successful outcomes, as individuals with both types attribution style have less need to defend their self-images in success. Airplane pilots with an internal locus of control were likely to exhibit a self-serving bias in regard to their skill and levels of safety.\n\nStudies have shown a slight discrepancy in males' and females' use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, men tended to attribute negative interactions to their partners more than women did. This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias more than women, although the study did not look at positive interaction attributions.\n\nOlder adults have been shown to make more internal causal attributions for negative outcomes. Differential attribution style at different ages indicates that the self-serving bias may be less likely in older adults. These older adults who attributed negative outcomes to more internal factors also rated themselves to be in poorer health, so negative emotional factors may confound the found age effects.\n\nThere is evidence of cross-cultural differences in the tendency to exhibit the self-serving bias, particularly when considering individualistic (Western) versus collectivistic (non-Western) societies. Family and group goals are important in collectivistic cultures. In contrast, the individual goals and identity focused on in individualistic societies increases the need for people within those cultures to guard and boost their personal self-esteem. While differences have been shown, conflicting literature has cited similarity in causal attributions across both individual and collective cultures, specifically between Belgium, West Germany, South Korea, and England. Naturalistic observation and information comparing United States and Japanese companies outcome attributions shows that the meaning and psychological function of internal versus external attributions are similar across cultures but that the difference is in the strategy of attribution. No consensus has been reached on cross-culture influences on the self-serving bias, though some systematic differences do seem to be present, especially between Western and non-Western cultures. For example, a study conducted by Kudo and Numuzaki named “Explicit and Direct Self-Serving Bias in Japan Reexamination of Self-Serving Bias for Success and Failure” showed that the participants in the success condition provided more internal attributions than the participants in the failure condition even though past research has constantly shown that Japanese people don’t tend to show a self-serving bias. Also, another study conducted by Hugten and Witteloostuijn named “The foreign language effect on the self-serving bias: A field experiment in the high school classroom” displayed the results that student participants between the ages of 13-15 who mainly process feedback in a non-native English tend to show more self-serving bias than those who process feedback in their native Dutch language.\n\nInvestigations of self-serving bias distinguish between the role of participants as the actor of a task or as the observer of someone else performing a task, relating closely to actor–observer asymmetry. Actors of a task exhibit the self-serving bias in their attributions to their own success or failure feedback, whereas observers do not make the same attributions about another person's task outcome. Observers tend to be more objective in their tendency to ascribe internal or external attributions to other people's outcomes. This may be due to the fact that the self-image of actors is challenged directly and therefore actors feel the need to protect their own self-image, but do not feel the same inclination to do so when the self-image of others is threatened.\n\nEmotions can influence feelings of self-esteem, which in turn alters the need to protect one's self-identity. Individuals with higher self-esteem are thought to have more to protect in their self-image, and therefore exhibit the self-serving bias more often than those individuals with lower self-esteem. In a study, participants who were induced to feel the emotions of guilt or revulsion were less likely to make self-serving attributions for success and less likely to make self-protecting attributions for failure. Coleman concluded that the two emotions of guilt and revulsion lead to a drop in self-esteem, and thus a reduction in the use of the self-serving bias.\n\nThe relationship between individuals' awareness levels and perceived probability of improvement also influences the activation of the self-serving bias. Individuals with high self-awareness attribute failure internally when they perceive a high probability of improvement. However, they will engage in self-serving bias, attributing failure externally when they perceive a low probability of improvement. Individuals low in self-awareness will attribute failure externally regardless of their perceived probability of improvement.\n\nWhether the self-serving bias is exhibited may depend on interpersonal closeness, relationships in a social context. When working in pairs to complete interdependent outcome tasks, relationally close pairs did not show a self-serving bias while relationally distant pairs did. A study on self-serving bias in relational context suggests this is due to the idea that close relationships place limits on an individual's self enhancement tendencies. The individual becomes more modest, when in a close relationship, and is less likely to use that relationship for his or her own benefit. Understanding why partners refrain from the self-serving bias is still in question but can partially be explained by favorable impression those in close relationships have for one another. A similar result was shown when looking at pairs of friends and strangers. Pairs performed an interdependent outcomes creativity test and were then given a bogus pipeline for a success or failure outcome. Strangers exhibited the self-serving bias in responsibility attributions, but friends tended to make joint attributions for both success and failure. Researchers have taken this as evidence for \"boundaries on self-enhancement\". In another study conducted in 2016, the implicit and explicit evaluation of 108 partners and exes as parents who were either married, separated or divorced was researched to investigate if the self-serving bias influenced them. Using two Implicit Association tests, one measuring Self vs Partner and the other measuring Self vs Ex, results showed that most of the time, men and women consider their exes or partners as less suitable parents which demonstrates the self-serving bias as they “ascribe more easily successes to internal factors” and failures towards their partners. Also, another result demonstrated that “women revealed a higher self-serving bias than men on both implicit and explicit measures, but only toward exes and not toward current partners” because they consider their exes as an out-group and their partners as an in-group.\n\nThe self-serving bias can be found in several aspects of the workplace. Research shows that the self-serving bias is used to explain employment: being hired for a job is attributed to personal factors, whereas failure to obtain a job is attributed to external factors. Experimental investigation of the explanations for unemployment through asking participants to imagine particular job opportunities and likelihood of getting those jobs, however, did not show such a self-serving bias. Researchers claim that this may be due to the actor-observer role differences in the self-serving bias. Within the workplace, victims of serious occupational accidents tend to attribute their accidents to external factors, whereas their coworkers and management tend to attribute the accidents to the victims' own actions. Interpersonal dynamics of the self-serving bias in the previous section have implications for attributions for outcomes in the workplace. In an investigation of group dynamics, virtual group members had to complete a decision-making task via computer-mediated communication. Results showed that the self-serving bias was present in negative outcomes, and that greater interpersonal distance from group members increased blame for negative outcomes.\n\nStudies revealed that narcissism was related to enhanced self-ratings of leadership, even when controlling for the Big Five traits. Another study showed that narcissism was related to enhanced leadership self-perceptions; indeed, whereas narcissism was significantly positively correlated with self-ratings of leadership, it was significantly negatively related to other ratings of leadership. This study also revealed that narcissism was related to more favorable self-ratings of workplace deviance and contextual performance compared to other (supervisor) ratings. Because narcissism broadly reflects strong self-admiration and behavioral tendencies which may not be viewed positively by others it is possible that narcissism influences self- and other perceptions differently, and insight into this possibility may be important given that differences in perceptions are the foundation for certain types of performance management and development practices.\n\nStudies in both lab and field settings have shown both teachers and students hold self-serving biases in regard to outcomes in the classroom. These attributions hold the potential for conflict between teacher and student since neither will take personal responsibility, as the student may blame the teacher while the teacher holds the student accountable. However, both teachers and students also reported being aware of the others' bias, which indicated there may be a feasible conflict resolution mechanism.\n\nComputers have become an integral part of everyday life, and research has shown that individuals may subconsciously treat interactions with computers as they would treat a social situation. This finding combined with what is known about the self-serving bias in interpersonal relations indicates that consumers that use a computer to buy products will take personal credit for successful purchases but blame the computer for negative purchase experiences. It was also found, however, that consumers are more willing to attribute successful purchases to the computer and not ascribe blame to the computer for failed purchases if they have \"intimate self-disclosure\" with the computer, which Moon describes as revelation of personal information that makes the discloser feel vulnerable. Another reason is that people are so used to bad functionality, counterintuitive features, bugs, and sudden crashes of most contemporary software applications that they tend not to complain about computer problems. Instead, they believe it is their personal responsibility to predict possible issues and to find solutions to computer problems. This unique phenomenon has been recently observed in several human-computer interaction investigations.\n\nIndividuals have been shown to exhibit the self-serving bias in regard to sports outcomes. In one study, collegiate wrestlers at the Division I level made self-reported attributions of the outcomes in their preseason matches. Winners were more likely than losers to attribute the match outcome to internal causes. The researchers note that wrestling is a one-on-one sport and has clearly defined winners. Therefore, other sports of this nature may show similar results, but other team sports or sports with more ambiguous outcomes may not show the same pattern for the self-serving bias. In another study conducted in 1987, the research focused on comparing the self-serving attributions made by individuals who played single sports and those who played in teams. The study gathered 549 statements that were coded for attributional content from lone performers such as tennis and golf players and team performers such as baseball, football or basketball players. The results showed that “lone performers made more self-serving attributions than team performers” because their performance outcomes have a greater effect on their individual esteem unlike for group outcomes where it “must often be distributed among all participants.” To expand upon self-serving attributions made by team sports, a study conducted in 1980 coded “newspaper accounts of baseball and football for attributional content.” The coding of the newspaper accounts showed that there was a “tendency to make internal attributions for success and external attributions for failure” which supports the self-serving bias as about 75% of the attributions from winning teams were internal while about 55% of attributions from losing teams were internal.\n\nClinically depressed patients tend to show less of a self-serving bias than individuals in the general population. In a study exploring the effects of mood on the self-serving bias, the moods of participants were manipulated to be either positive or negative. Negative mood participants were less likely to attribute successful outcomes to the self than positive mood participants, attributing success to external factors. It has been suggested that the negative mood within depressed individuals as well as their self-focused attention explains why clinically depressed populations are less likely to exhibit the self-serving bias than normal populations.\n\nThe self-serving bias has been investigated by the fMRI method in normal populations. Attributions using the bias show activation in the dorsal striatum, which plays a role in motivated behavior, as well as in the dorsal anterior cingulate. In clinically depressed patients, there appear to be weaker connections between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and limbic areas of the brain, so this connection may play a role in self-serving attributions.\n\nIn a study employing the EEG method of examining brain activation, participants were given bogus outcome feedback that indicated either success or failure and told to make attributions. Different from non-self-serving responses, self-serving responses did not show increased dorsomedial frontal cortex activity preceding attribution decisions. Such lack of brain activity implies that self-control, which is controlled by the dorsomedial frontal cortex, is not as prominent in self-serving attributions as non-self-serving ones.\n"}

It comprises a disparate group of horticultural interests that can share the aims and objectives associated with the international post-1980s sustainable development and sustainability programs developed to address the fact that humans are now using natural biophysical resources faster than they can be replenished by nature. \n\nIncluded within this compass are those home gardeners, and members of the landscape and nursery industries, and municipal authorities, that integrate environmental, social, and economic factors to create a more sustainable future.\n\nOrganic gardening and the use of native plants are integral to sustainable gardening.\n\nAfter the establishment of sustainable agriculture in the early 1980s it was some time before the emergence of Sustainable Horticulture (as sustainable \"production\" horticulture) at the International Society of Horticultural Science's First International Symposium on Sustainability in Horticulture held at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. This symposium produced \"conclusions ... on Sustainability in Horticulture and a Declaration for the 21st Century\". The principles and objectives outlined at this conference were discussed in more practical terms at the following conference at Seoul in 2006.\n\nMany of the eco-friendly principles and ideas espoused by sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites perpetuate sustainable practices established as a reaction to resource-intensive industrial agriculture. These practices were established as movements for self-sufficiency and small-scale farming based on a holistic systems approach and ecological principles. Included here would be: biodynamic agriculture, no-till farming, agroecology, Fukuoka farming, forest gardening, organic gardening and others. On a larger scale there is the more recent \"whole farm planning\" which was established in 1995, and ecoagriculture established in 2000, and other variants of sustainable agricultural systems. Perhaps the most influential of these approaches is permaculture, established by Australians Bill Mollison and David Holmgren as both a design system and a loosely defined philosophy or lifestyle ethic. Permaculture shares many principles and practices of the above but not the broad philosophical base as indicated by the title of the 2002 publication \"Permaculture, principles and pathways beyond sustainability\". The application of sustainability principles to the horticultural sphere has now become broadly accepted in commerce and academia.\n\nThe American Sustainable Sites Initiative is an interdisciplinary approach used by the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center and the United States Botanic Garden to create voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices: it was founded in 2005. Using the United Nations Brundtland Report’s definition of sustainable development as a model, it defines sustainability within its own sphere of reference as: … \"design, construction, operations and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\" by attempting to: \n...\"protect, restore and enhance the ability of landscapes to provide ecosystem services that benefit humans and other organisms\".\n\nManaging global biophysical cycles and ecosystem services for the benefit of humans, other organisms and future generations has now become a global human responsibility. The method of applying sustainability to gardens, landscapes and sites is still under development and varies somewhat according to the context under consideration. However, there are a number of basic and common underlying biological and operational principles and practices in the sustainable sites literature.\n\nSustainable management of man-made landscapes emulates the natural processes that sustain the biosphere and its ecosystems. First and foremost is the harnessing the energy of the Sun and the cycling of materials thereby minimising waste and energy use.\n\nRunning within, and dependent on, the natural economy there is the production and consumption of goods and services in the “human economy” which has now significantly altered, in a detrimental way, natural biogeochemical cycles (notable here are the water cycle, carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle so sustainable practices maximise support for ecosystem services.\n\nThe use of native plants in a garden or landscape can both preserve and protect natural ecosystems, and reduce the amount of care and energy required to maintain a healthy garden or landscape. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and geology, and often require less maintenance than exotic species. Native plants also support populations of native birds, insects, and other animals that they coevolved with, thus promoting a healthy community of organisms.\n\nPlants in a garden or maintained landscape often form a source population from which plants can colonize new areas. Avoiding the use of invasive species helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations. Similarly, the use of native species can provide a valuable source to help these plants colonise new areas.\n\nSome non-native species can form an ecological trap in which native species are lured into an environment that appears attractive but is poorly suited to them.\n\nHowever, in Britain research by the University of Sheffield as part of the BUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) has revealed that for many invertebrates - the majority of wild animals in most gardens - it is not just native plants which can sustain them. The findings were published in popular form in Ken Thompson's book 'No Nettles Required: The truth about wildlife gardening'. He confirms the approach which Chris Baines had promoted in 'How to Make a Wildlife Garden' .\n\nEnhancement of ecosystem services is encouraged throughout the lifecycle of any site by providing clear design, construction, (operations), and management criteria. To be sustainable over the long term requires environmental, social and economic demands are integrated to provide intergenerational equity by providing regenerative sustainable systems. Operational guidelines will link to and supplement existing guidelines for the built environment (supplementing existing green building and landscape guidelines), the wider environment, and they will include metrics (benchmarks, audits, criteria, indexes etc.) that give some measure of sustainability (a rating system) by clarifying what is sustainable or not sustainable or, more likely, what is more or less sustainable.\n\nImpacts of a site can be assessed and measured over any spatio-temporal scale or context.\n\nImpacts of a site may be \"direct\" by having direct measurable impacts on biodiversity and ecology at the site itself or \"indirect\" when impacts occur away from the site.\n\nThe following are some site principles for sustainable gardening:\n\nOne major feature distinguishing the approach of sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites from other similar enterprises is the quantification of site sustainability by establishing performance benchmarks. Because sustainability is such a broad and inclusive concept the environmental impacts of sites can be categorised in numerous ways depending on the purpose for which the figures are required. The process can include minimising negative environmental impacts and maximising positive impacts. As currently applied the environment is usually given priority over social and economic factors which may be added in or regarded as an inevitable and integral part of the management process. A home gardener is likely to use simpler metrics than a professional landscaper or ecologist.\n\nThree methodologies for measuring site sustainability include BREEAM developed by the BRE organisation in the UK, Leed, developed in America and the Oxford 360 degree sustainability Index used in Oxford Park and developed by the Oxford Sustainable Group in Scandinavia.\n\nThe \"Sustainable Sites Initiative\" is producing recommendations for the American Landscape Industry. The standards and guidelines finally adopted will lead to a uniform national standard, which does not currently exist. Sustainable Sites is currently in the pilot program stage, and will formally introduce its first rating system by 2013. The U.S. Green Building Council supports the project and plans to adopt the Sustainable Sites metrics into future versions of its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System. Sites are rated according to their impact on ecosystem services: The following ecosystem services have been identified by the study group:\n\nINPUTS\n\nOUTPUTS\n\nPROCESSES\nAny kind of auditing or benchmarking will depend on the selection and weighting of the metrics chosen; the depth and detail of analysis required; the purpose for which the figures are required; and the environmental circumstances of the particular site.\n\n"}
{"id": "2179980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179980", "title": "The Power Elite", "text": "The Power Elite\n\nThe Power Elite is a 1956 book by sociologist C. Wright Mills, in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the military, corporate, and political elements of society and suggests that the ordinary citizen is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.\n\nThe book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, \"\", which examines the then-growing role of middle managers in American society. A main inspiration for the book was Franz Leopold Neumann's book \"\" in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. \"Behemoth\" had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the \"tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy\".\n\nAccording to Mills, the eponymous \"power elite\" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \"the underlying populations of the world.\" The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) \"two or three hundred giant corporations\" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from \"a decentralized set of several dozen states\" and \"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\" and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of \"distrust fed by state militia,\" but now an entity with \"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.\"\n\nImportantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that \"often they are uncertain about their roles\" and \"without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide.\" Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at eastern establishment universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. But, Mills notes, \"Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?\" Mills identifies two classes of Ivy League alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon fraternity or final club, such as Porcellian and Fly Club, and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private preparatory academies, where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. \n\nThe resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: \n\nMills formulated a very short summary of his book: \"Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.\"\n\nCommenting on \"The Power Elite\", Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. derisively said, \"I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again.\"\n\nAdolf Berle noted the book contained \"an uncomfortable degree of truth\", but Mills presented \"an angry cartoon, not a serious picture\". Dennis Wrong described \"The Power Elite\" as \"an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation\".\n\nA review of the book in the \"Louisiana Law Review\" bemoaned that the \"practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research\".\n\nNonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, G. William Domhoff wrote, \"Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago\". Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that \"The Power Elite\" was \"vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering\" but declared that its historical value \"seems assured\". In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.\n\nEpisode 5 of the Netflix TV series \"Mindhunter\" contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah \"Debbie\" Mitford, writes a paper on C. Wright Mills's \"The Power Elite\".\n\n"}
{"id": "17042888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17042888", "title": "Tone letter", "text": "Tone letter\n\nTone letters are letters that represent the tones of a language, most commonly in languages with contour tones.\n\nA series of iconic tone letters based on a musical staff was devised by Yuen Ren Chao and adopted into the International Phonetic Alphabet. Previously the contour had been drawn without the staff, making the height of the tone difficult to read. \n\nCombinations of these tone letters are schematics of the pitch contour of a tone, mapping the pitch in the letter space and ending in a vertical bar. For example, represents the mid-dipping pitch contour of the Chinese word for horse, 馬/马 \"mǎ\". Single tone letters differentiate up to five pitch levels: 'extra high' or 'top', 'high', 'mid', 'low', and 'extra low' or 'bottom'. No language is known to depend on more than five levels of pitch.\n\nThese letters are most commonly written at the end of a syllable. For example, Standard Mandarin has the following four tones in syllables spoken in isolation:\nHowever, they are sometimes written before the syllable, in accordance with writing stress and downstep before the syllable. For example, the following passage transcribes the prosody of European Portuguese using tone letters alongside stress, upstep, and downstep in the same position before the syllable:\n\nDiacritics may also be used to transcribe tone in the IPA. For example, tone 3 in Mandarin is a low tone between other syllables, and can be represented as such phonemically. The four Mandarin tones can therefore also be transcribed . (Note that these conflict with the convention of Pinyin, and so in this case IPA diacritics may be confusing. In pinyin these would be transcribed mā, má, mǎ, mà respectively)\n\nSinologists sometimes use reversed Chao tone letters to indicate tone sandhi, with the IPA left-facing letters on the left for the underlying tone, and reversed right-facing letters on the right for the surface tone. For example, the Mandarin phrase \"nǐ\" + \"hǎo\" > \"ní hǎo\" would be transcribed:\n\nTone letters are often transliterated into numerals, particularly in Asian and Mesoamerican tone languages. Until the spread of OpenType computer fonts starting in 2000–2001, tone letters were not practical for many applications. A numerical substitute has been commonly used for tone contours, with a numerical value assigned to the beginning, end, and sometimes middle of the contour. For example, the four Mandarin tones are commonly transcribed as \"ma55\", \"ma35\", \"ma214\", \"ma51\".\n\nHowever, such numerical systems are ambiguous. In Asian languages such as Chinese, convention assigns the lowest pitch a 1 and the highest a 5, corresponding to fundamental frequency (f). Conversely, in Africa the lowest tone is assigned a 5 and the highest a 1, barring a few exceptional cases with six tone levels, which may have the opposite convention of 1 being low and 6 being high. In the case of Mesoamerican languages, the highest tone is 1 but the lowest depends on the number of contrastive pitch levels in the language being transcribed. For example, an Otomanguean language with three level tones will denote them as 1 (high ), 2 (mid ) and 3 (low ). (Three-tone systems occur in Mixtecan, Chinantecan and Amuzgoan languages.) A reader accustomed to Chinese usage will misinterpret the Mixtec low tone as mid, and the high tone as low. Because tone letters are iconic, and musical staves are internationally recognized with high tone at the top and low tone at the bottom, tone letters do not suffer from this ambiguity.\n\nThe International Phonetic Association suggests using the tone letters to represent phonemic contrasts. For example, if a language has a single falling tone, then it should be transcribed as , even if this tone does not fall across the entire pitch range.\n\nFor the purposes of a precise linguistic analysis there are at least three approaches: linear, exponential, and language-specific. A linear approach is to map the tone levels directly to fundamental frequency (f), by subtracting the tone with lowest f from the tone with highest f, and dividing this space into four equal f intervals. Tone letters are then chosen based on the f tone contours over this region. This linear approach is systematic, but it does not always align the beginning and end of each tone with the proposed tone levels. Chao's earlier description of the tone levels is an exponential approach. Chao proposed five tone levels, where each level is spaced two semitones apart. A later description provides only one semitone between levels 1 and 2, and three semitones between levels 2 and 3. This updated description may be a language-specific division of the tone space.\n\nIn Unicode, the IPA tone letters are encoded as follows:\nThese are combined in sequence for contour tones. Unicode includes other tone letters, such as UPA and extended tone marks for bopomofo (see).\n\nThe reversed tone letters are:\n\nThe dotted tone letters are: and reversed .\n\nAlthough the phrase \"tone letter\" generally refers to the Chao system, there are also orthographies with letters assigned to individual tones, and these may also be called tone letters.\n\nIn several systems, tone numbers are integrated into the orthography, so that they are technically letters even though they continue to be called \"numbers\". However, in the case of Zhuang, the 1957 Chinese orthography modified the digits to make them graphically distinct from digits used numerically; two letters were adopted from Cyrillic: and , replacing the similar-looking tone numbers and . In 1982 these were replaced with Latin letters, one of which, , now pulls double-duty as a consonant letter for and as a tone letter for mid tone.\n\nThe Hmong Romanized Popular Alphabet was devised in the early 1950s with Latin tone letters. Two of the 'tones' are more accurately called register, as tone is not their distinguishing feature. Several of the letters pull double duty representing consonants.\n\nAnd a unified Miao alphabet used in China applies a different scheme:\nThe Uralic Phonetic Alphabet has marks resembling half brackets that indicate the beginning and end of high and low tone: .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "445952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445952", "title": "Transformative learning", "text": "Transformative learning\n\nTransformative learning theory says that the process of \"perspective transformation\" has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).\n\nPerspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. Jack Mezirow believes that it usually results from a \"disorienting dilemma\" which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition—although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time. Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher, also promote transformation.\n\nAn important part of transformative learning is for individuals to change their frames of reference by critically reflecting on their assumptions and beliefs and consciously making and implementing plans that bring about new ways of defining their worlds. This process is fundamentally rational and analytical.\n\nJack Mezirow developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978. Since then, the theory has evolved \"into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and reformulate the meaning of their experience.\" For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), \"they must engage in critical reflection on their experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation.\" The meaning schemes that make up meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning.\n\nA perspective transformation leading to transformative learning, however, occurs much less frequently. Mezirow believes that this less frequent transformation usually results from a \"disorienting dilemma\", which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition, although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.\n\nThe perspective is explained by Mezirow as follows:\n\nA number of critical responses to Mezirow's theory of transformative learning have emerged over the years. One criticism of Mezirow's theory is its emphasis upon rationality. Some studies support Mezirow. Others conclude that Mezirow grants rational critical reflection too much importance.\n\nEdward W. Taylor has since suggested neurobiological research as a promising area that may offer some explanation about the role emotions play, closing the gap between rationality and emotion in the transformative learning process. Taylor implies that, with available modern technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), these once obscure factors can now be examined through determining which neurological brain systems are at work during disorienting dilemmas and the journey of recovery that follows. This neurobiological research also stresses the importance of the role of implicit memory, from which emerge habits, attitudes and preferences that are related to unconscious thoughts and actions.\n\nWhile the learning process is certainly rational on some levels, it is also a profound experience that can be described as a spiritual or emotional transformation as well. The experience of undoing racist, sexist, and other oppressive attitudes can be painful and emotional, as these attitudes have often been developed as ways to cope with and make sense of the world. This type of learning requires taking risks, and a willingness to be vulnerable and have one's attitudes and assumptions challenged.\n\nOther theorists have proposed a view of transformative learning as an intuitive and emotional process. John M. Dirkx, Robert D. Boyd, J. Gordon Myers, and Rosemary R. Ruether link Mezirow's rational, cognitive and analytical approach to a more intuitive, creative and holistic view of transformative learning. This view of transformative learning is based primarily on the work of Robert Boyd, who has developed a theory of transformative education based on analytical (or depth) psychology.\n\nFor Boyd, transformation is a \"fundamental change in one's personality involving [together] the resolution of a personal dilemma and the expansion of consciousness resulting in greater personality integration\". This calls upon extra-rational sources such as symbols, images, and archetypes to assist in creating a personal vision or meaning of what it means to be human.\n\nFirst, an individual must be receptive or open to receiving \"alternative expressions of meaning\", and then recognize that the message is authentic. Grieving, considered by Boyd to be the most critical phase of the discernment process, takes place when an individual realizes that old patterns or ways of perceiving are no longer relevant, moves to adopt or establish new ways, and finally integrates old and new patterns. More recent research has specifically explored the process of transformative learning as it occurs in bereaved elders, maintaining that the \"disorienting dilemma\" deemed necessary by Mezirow is present in the loss of a loved one, with an additional devastating factor being the isolation that the elderly in particular are likely to face. Another study considers transformative learning in the context of suicide bereavement. In these cases the dilemma is compounded by the questioning of conceptions or misconceptions that were held about the relationship with the deceased, and the resolving of the meaning of that relationship during the grieving process.\n\nUnlike Mezirow, who sees the ego as playing a central role in the process of perspective transformation, Boyd and Myers use a framework that moves beyond the ego and the emphasis on reason and logic to a definition of transformative learning that is more psychosocial in nature.\n\nAnother definition of transformative learning was put forward by Edmund O'Sullivan:\n\nPositing that understanding transformative learning may have been hindered by perspectives of rational thought and Western traditions, Kathleen P. King provides an alternate model grounded in a meta-analysis of research, the \"Transformative Learning Opportunities Model\".\n\nRecent considerations of these varying perspectives seem to indicate that one perspective does not need to exclude the other. For example, Mezirow and Dirkx discussed their views on transformative learning at a 2005 International Transformative Learning Conference. This dialogue, facilitated by Patricia Cranton, continued via email after the conference and the overview was published in the \"Journal of Transformative Education\". Dirkx focuses on subjectivity, in the power of the inner world in one's shift in view of the outer world. Mezirow emphasizes critical assessment of assumptions. Although their approaches are different, they agree that their perspectives are similar in several aspects. This includes transforming frames of reference that have lost meaning or have become dysfunctional, and fostering enhanced awareness and consciousness of one's being in the world. Both perspectives are required to deepen understanding and to incorporate these ways of learning into transformative education.\n\nOne of the difficulties in defining transformative learning is that it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as \"meaning making\" or \"critical thinking\".\n\nThe term \"meaning making\" (i.e., constructing meaning) is found most frequently in constructivist approaches to education, based on the work of educators such as John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Lev Vygotsky. In the constructivist view, meaning is constructed from knowledge.\n\nJohn Dirkx views transformational learning as a meaning-making process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision of society and self-actualization of individuals. Learning \"is\" life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment to focus on the here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language for helping us learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective. Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.\n\nMezirow posits that all learning is change but not all change is transformation. There is a difference between transmissional, transactional and transformational education. In the first, knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student. In transactional education, it is recognized that the student has valuable experiences, and learns best through experience, inquiry, critical thinking and interaction with other learners. It could be argued that some of the research regarding transformative learning has been in the realm of transactional education, and that what is seen as transformative by some authors is in fact still within the realm of transactional learning.\n\nAccording to Stephen D. Brookfield, learning can only be considered transformative if it involves a fundamental questioning or reordering of how one thinks or acts; a challenge to hegemonic implications. In other words, reflection alone does not result in transformative learning unless the process involves a critical reflection, a recognition and analysis of taken-for-granted assumptions.\n\nOn the surface, the two views of transformative learning presented here are contradictory. One advocates a rational approach that depends primarily on critical reflection whereas the other relies more on intuition and emotion. However, the differences in the two views may best be seen as a matter of emphasis. Both utilize rational processes and incorporate imagination as a part of a creative process. The two different views of transformative learning described here as well as examples of how it occurs in practice suggest that no single model of transformative learning exists.\n\nWhen transformative learning is the goal of adult education, fostering a learning environment in which it can occur should consider the following:\n\nTransformative learning cannot be guaranteed. Teachers can only provide an opportunity to transformatively learn. In order to foster transformative learning, the educator's role is to assist learners in becoming aware and critical of assumptions. This includes their own assumptions that lead to their interpretations, beliefs, habits of mind, or points of view, as well as the assumptions of others. Educators must provide learners practice in recognizing frames of reference. By doing so, educators encourage practice in redefining problems from different perspectives. The goal is to create a community of learners who are \"united in a shared experience of trying to make meaning of their life experience\".\n\nEducators need to provide learners with opportunities to effectively participate in discourse. Discourse involves assessing beliefs, feelings, and values. This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view. Learners are able to validate how and what they understand, as well as develop well-informed judgments regarding a belief. Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.\n\nThe educator must encourage equal participation among students in discourse. One strategy is to encourage procedures that require group members to take on the roles of monitoring the direction of dialogue and ensuring equal participation. Educators can also encourage dialogue from different perspectives through controversial statements or readings from opposing points of view. It is necessary that the educator avoids shaping the discussion.\n\nThe role of educators is also to set objectives that include autonomous thinking. By fostering learners' critical reflection and experience in discourse, autonomous thinking is possible. The foundations to thinking autonomously begin in childhood and continue in adulthood. The educator assists adult learners in becoming more critical in assessing assumptions, better at recognizing frames of references and alternate perspectives, as well as effective at collaborating with others to assess and arrive at judgments in regards to beliefs.\n\nIt is the role of the educator to promote discovery learning through the implementation of classroom methods such as learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations. These methods facilitate transformative learning by helping learners examine concepts in the context of their lives and analyze the justification of new knowledge.\n\nThe educator's role in establishing an environment that builds trust and care and facilitates the development of sensitive relationships among learners is a fundamental principle of fostering transformative learning. The educator also serves as a role model by demonstrating a willingness to learn and change. Teachers should provide the environment to allow students to reflect on their transformative learning experiences, but to also allow them to reflect on their own. As a result, professional development is important to assist educators in becoming authentic and critically reflective.\n\nMezirow outlines three ways in which experience is interpreted through reflection:\n\n\nTransformative learning about teaching occurs when educators critically examine their practice and develop alternative perspectives of understanding their practice. It is essential that fostering this critical examination become the role of professional development. The role of professional development is to assist educators in gaining awareness of their habits of mind regarding teaching. As this professional development occurs, educators critically examine the assumptions that underlie their practice, the consequences to their assumptions, and develop alternative perspectives on their practice.\n\nTeachers need education and professional development that will help them to question, challenge and experience critical discussions on school improvement. Transforming teachers so they see themselves as agents of social change can be a challenge within education.\n\nStrategies for transformative professional development include action plans, reflective activities, case studies, curriculum development, and critical-theory discussions. Action plans and reflective activities provide the practice and modelling of critical reflection on the profession of education, and provide guidance for the teaching and learning experience. Through the use of real-life examples, case studies provide the opportunity to analyze assumptions, as well as the consequences of choices and actions. The use of case studies focuses on practice, and on the philosophical and practical aspects of educators' practice. Curriculum development creates the opportunity to connect theory and practice. In addition to introducing new teaching techniques, educators can test and compare new concepts and practices with previous techniques. This testing and comparison moves away from uncritically accepting new teaching methods. Critical-theory discussions can be implemented to guide educators in questioning the meaning and purpose of information, encouraging educators to question the selection of the information they provide to their students.\n\nMentoring is another strategy for transformative professional, personal and organizational development. By creating a supportive culture, mentoring can provide the environment for transformative learning to occur. Through this experience mentoring becomes a transformative relationship in which individuals reconstruct possible selves. As a two-way process, mentoring is a learning tool for both the mentor as well as the person being mentored.\n\nIn a recent study, Karen Weller Swanson, applying theories of critical reflection, incorporating a critical incident model, and positing a learning partnership, designed a program for practicing teachers, for the purpose of transformative teacher development. Experiences were created to get teachers to reflect on their assumptions, asking them to consider alternative perspectives and to develop a language for making connections between theory and practice. Over the studies' two-year period, teachers were able to develop ownership of theory and transfer this knowledge into their practice. To be effective, transformative teacher development must value what teachers bring from their personal and professional experience, and acknowledge that learning is both an individual and a social experience. The process involved: achieving transparency through negotiation of curriculum, finding a common language through discussion of individual assumptions, getting continuous feedback through critical-incident questions, and testing by teacher application of the program within their classrooms. Autobiography and journaling were additional techniques used within this learning partnership. Both teachers and faculty participating in the program were transformed as beliefs were challenged and knowledge was co-constructed throughout the experience.\n\nNew teachers often find expectations ambiguous, and they lack the self-awareness and understanding to navigate the educational environment. A transformative learning framework was used in a Foundations course, for participants to build on individual and collective analysis of teaching experiences, and to help them re-frame their practice. Giedre Kligyte investigated \"transformation narratives\" that emerged from written reflection of participants' teaching practice, based on individual reflection and group discussion. By using Mezirow's work, along with Robert Kegan's constructive developmental theory, Kligyte found the following themes: a move from non-reflective habitual action to a more conscious practice; a change in perspective to a more sophisticated view of teaching; an increased sense of agency, including the concept that academic practice is an object which can be controlled and shaped, rather than something externally imposed; increased confidence to take risks and experiment; and a more multifaceted idea of what it means to be an academic. The conducive environment allowed for transformative experiences to occur. Through creation of a safe social context where \"disorienting dilemmas\" can be examined, questioned, and explored, participants were able to develop a new \"frame of reference\" and reintegrate learning into practice. Kligyte cautions that there are limitations to the framework, such as the possibility that participants will conform to expectations in their reflections. She notes that the \"transformation narratives\" examined are not a single, final narrative of the self, but a snapshot for further exploration. Kligyte's findings are similar to S. Fletcher's: that transformative learning helps to make sense of a complex and often ambiguous work environment, which requires multiple selves.\n\nThe educator becomes a facilitator when the goal of learning is for learners to construct knowledge about themselves, others, and social norms. As a result, learners play an important role in the learning environment and process. Learners must create norms within the classroom that include civility, respect, and responsibility for helping one another learn. Learners must welcome diversity within the learning environment and aim for peer collaboration.\n\nLearners must become critical of their own assumptions in order to transform their unquestioned frame of reference. Through communicative learning, learners must work towards critically reflecting on assumptions that underlie intentions, values, beliefs, and feelings. Learners are involved in objective re-framing of their frames of reference when they critically reflect on the assumptions of others. In contrast, subjective re-framing occurs when learners critically assess their own assumptions.\n\nThe role of the learner involves actively participating in discourse. Through discourse, learners are able to validate what is being communicated to them. This dialogue provides the opportunity to critically examine evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view, which fosters collaborative learning.\n\nTransformative learning has two components that at times seem to be in conflict: the cognitive, rational, and objective and the intuitive, imaginative, and subjective. Both the rational and the affective play a role in transformative learning. Although the emphasis has been on transformative learning as a rational process, teachers need to consider how they can help students use feelings and emotions both in critical reflection and as a means of reflection.\n\nThere are a number of educational and research institutions that are based on the principles of transformative learning. Some examples include the Transformative Studies Institute and The Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) of the University of Toronto.\n\nEvidence is emerging on the applicability of transformative theory in new educational programmes, in business and industry education, health professional education, community education such as courses offered by YMCA, and informal settings such as self-help groups. Phil Bamber and Les Hankin describe how students in a service-learning section experienced perspective transformation and shifts of their world-view when their training was influenced by transformative learning theory.\n\nSusan Imel states that transformative learning may not always be a goal of education, but its importance should not be overlooked. Educators should strive to understand it, even if they choose not to foster it.\n\n"}
{"id": "533069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533069", "title": "Type (biology)", "text": "Type (biology)\n\nIn biology, a type is a particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular taxon. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.\n\nA taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a species description) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.\n\nAccording to a precise set of rules laid down in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular \"specimen\", or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to taxonomists. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a museum or herbarium research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type. Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of scientific nomenclature and alpha taxonomy.\n\nWhen identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.\n\nThis process is crucial to the science of biological taxonomy. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call \"\"Canis lupus\" is the same thing, or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling \"Canis lupus\"\" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.\n\nDepending on the nomenclature code applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an illustration, or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.\n\nFor example, in the research collection of the Natural History Museum in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the spotted harrier, which currently bears the scientific name \"Circus assimilis\". This particular specimen is the holotype for that species; the name \"Circus assimilis\" refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.\n\nNote that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a \"typical\" individual to be used. Genera and families, particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more \"typical\" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in systematics \"cannot\" be. Hence, the term name-bearing type or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define \"typical\" individuals or taxa, but rather fix a scientific name to a specific operational taxonomic unit. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.\n\nThe usage of the term \"type\" is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in botany and zoology. In the \"PhyloCode\", type-based definitions are replaced by phylogenetic definitions.\n\nIn some older taxonomic works the word \"type\" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first \"Laws of Botanical Nomenclature\", but has a meaning closer to the term taxon in some other works:\nTranslation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.\n\nIn botanical nomenclature, a \"type\" (\"typus\", \"nomenclatural type\"), \"is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached.\" (article 7.1) In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, \"curated\", in a herbarium (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:\n\nNote that a type does not determine the circumscription of the taxon. For example, the common dandelion is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name \"Taraxacum officinale\" is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (\"Taraxacum officinale\" is a \"big\" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (\"Taraxacum officinale\" is a \"small\" species). The name \"Taraxacum officinale\" is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\nThe \"ICN\" provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9), the most important of which is the holotype. These are\n\nNote that the word \"type\" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the \"ICN\": for example a clonotype.\n\nIn zoological nomenclature, the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens. The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A \"name-bearing type\" is a specimen or image that \"provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined.\"\n\n\nAlthough in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.\n\nA type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '. In the case of parasites, the term ' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.\n\nZoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one \"holotype\" designated, there can be other \"type\" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:\n\nWhen a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the \"holotype\" of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.\n\nWhen the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not name-bearing types.\n\nAn allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil. The term is not regulated by the ICZN.\n\nA neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.\n\nA syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.\n\nA lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of syntypes.\nIn zoology, a lectotype is a kind of name-bearing type. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.\n\nA notable example is that Carl Linnaeus is the lectotype for the species \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nA paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.\n\nA special case in Protistans where the type consists of two or more specimens of \"directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle\"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.\n\nAn illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, \"Python bivittatus,\" is one of many species that are based on illustrations by Albertus Seba (1734).\n\nAn ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in hymenopterans which have polymorphic castes.\n\nType illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the Réunion parakeet, which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.\n\nRecently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (a bushshrike), described as \"Laniarius liberatus\", in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown color morph of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.\n\nThe various types listed above are necessary because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.\n\nThe ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many \"type-less\" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a neotype unless there is \"an exceptional need\" for \"clarifying the taxonomic status\" of a species (Article 75.2).\n\nThere are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix \"-type\" (e.g., allotype, cotype, topotype, generitype, isotype, isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).\n\nThe term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.\n\nEach genus must have a designated type species (the term \"genotype\" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for a different concept in genetics). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.\n\nIdeally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).\n\nA type genus is that genus from which the name of a family or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32308", "title": "United States customary units", "text": "United States customary units\n\nUnited States customary units are a system of measurements commonly used in the United States. The United States customary system (USCS or USC) developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems.\n\nThe majority of U.S. customary units were redefined in terms of the meter and the kilogram with the Mendenhall Order of 1893 and, in practice, for many years before. These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound agreement of 1959. \n\nAmericans primarily use customary units in commercial activities, as well as for personal and social use. In science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, metric units are used. The International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system, is preferred for many uses by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For newer units of measure where there is no traditional customary unit, international units are used, sometimes mixed with customary units, such as electrical resistance of wire expressed in ohms (SI) per thousand feet.\n\nThe United States system of units is similar to the British imperial system. Both systems are derived from English units, a system which had evolved over the millennia before American independence, and which had its roots in Roman and Anglo-Saxon units.\n\nThe customary system was championed by the U.S.-based International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late 19th century. Advocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary, or metric, system as atheistic. An auxiliary of the Institute in Ohio published a poem with wording such as \"down with every 'metric' scheme\" and \"A perfect inch, a perfect pint\". One adherent of the customary system called it \"a just weight and a just measure, which alone are acceptable to the Lord\".\n\nThe U.S. government passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which made the metric system \"the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce\". The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it \"voluntarily\" converts to the metric system, i.e., metrification. This is most evident in U.S. labeling requirements on food products, where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary units. According to the CIA Factbook, the United States is one of three nations (along with Liberia and Burma) that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures.\n\nU.S. customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing. Metric units are standard in science, medicine, as well as many sectors of industry and government, including the military. There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades, on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters, or that foot-inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves, thirds and quarters, often in parallel. The metric system also lacks a parallel to the foot.\n\nFor measuring length, the U.S. customary system uses the inch, foot, yard, and mile, which are the only four customary length measurements in everyday use. Since July 1, 1959, these have been defined on the basis of 1 yard = 0.9144 meters except for some applications in surveying. The U.S., the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries agreed on this definition, and so it is often termed \"international measure\".\n\nWhen international measure was introduced in the English-speaking countries, the basic geodetic datum in North America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27), which had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, that is 1 foot =  meters: this definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the \"US survey foot\" to distinguish it from the international foot. For most applications, the difference between the two definitions is insignificant – one international foot is exactly 0.999998 of a US survey foot, for a difference of about  inch (3 mm) per mile – but it affects the definition of the State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles.\n\nThe NAD27 was replaced in the 1980s by the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which is defined in meters. The SPCSs were also updated, but the National Geodetic Survey left the decision of which (if any) definition of the foot to use to the individual states. All SPCSs are defined in meters, but seven states also have SPCSs defined in US survey feet and an eighth state in international feet: the other 42 states use only meter-based SPCSs.\n\nState legislation is also important for determining the conversion factor to be used for everyday land surveying and real estate transactions, although the difference (2 ppm) is of no practical significance given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures should be based on the US survey foot, eight have legislated that they be made on the basis of the international foot, and eighteen have not specified the conversion factor from metric units.\nThe most widely used area unit with a name unrelated to any length unit is the acre. The National Institute of Standards and Technology contends that customary area units are defined in terms of the square survey foot, not the square international foot. Conversion factors are based on Astin (July 27, 1968) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (2008).\nThe cubic inch, cubic foot and cubic yard are commonly used for measuring volume. In addition, there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids, and one for measuring volumes of dry material.\n\nOther than the cubic inch, cubic foot and cubic yard, these units are differently sized from the units in the imperial system, although the names of the units are similar. Also, while the U.S. has separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, the imperial system has one set of units for both.\nOne US fluid ounce is of a US pint, of a US quart, and of a US gallon. The teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup are defined in terms of a fluid ounce as , , and 8 fluid ounces. The fluid ounce derives its name originally from being the volume of one ounce avoirdupois of water, but in the US it is defined as of a US gallon. Consequently, a fluid ounce of water weighs about 1.041 ounces avoirdupois.\n\nThe saying \"a pint's a pound the world around\" refers to 16 US fluid ounces of water weighing approximately (about 4% more than) one pound avoirdupois. An imperial pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter (20 oz).\n\nThere are varying standards for barrel for some specific commodities, including 31 gal for beer, 40 gal for whiskey or kerosene, and 42 gal for petroleum. The general standard for liquids is 31.5 gal or half a hogshead. The common 55 gallon size of drum for storing and transporting various products and wastes is sometimes confused with a barrel, though it is not a standard measure.\n\nIn the U.S., single servings of beverages are usually measured in fluid ounces. Milk is usually sold in half pints (8 fluid ounces), pints, quarts, half gallons, and gallons. Water volume for sinks, bathtubs, ponds, swimming pools, etc., is usually stated in gallons or cubic feet. Quantities of gases are usually given in cubic feet (at one atmosphere).\n\nMinims, drams and gill are rarely used currently. The gill is often referred to as a \"half-cup\".\nDry volume is measured on a separate system, although many of the names remain the same. Small fruits and vegetables are often sold in dry pints and dry quarts. The US dry gallon is less commonly used, and was not included in the handbook that many states recognize as the authority on measurement law. However pecks, or bushels are sometimes used—particularly for grapes, apples and similar fruits in agricultural regions.\n\nThere have historically been five different English systems of mass: tower, apothecaries', troy, avoirdupois, and metric. Of these, the avoirdupois weight is the most common system used in the U.S., although Troy weight is still used to weigh precious metals. Apothecaries weight—once used by pharmacies—has been largely replaced by metric measurements. Tower weight fell out of use in England (due to legal prohibition in 1527) centuries ago, and was never used in the U.S. The imperial system, which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is based on avoirdupois, with variations from U.S. customary units larger than a pound.\n\nThe pound avoirdupois, which forms the basis of the U.S. customary system of mass, is defined as exactly by agreement between the U.S., the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking countries in 1959. Other units of mass are defined in terms of it.\n\nThe avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of mass, but the name pound is also applied to measures of force. For instance, in many contexts, the pound avoirdupois is used as a unit of mass, but in some contexts, the term \"pound\" is used to refer to \"pound-force\". The slug is another unit of mass derived from pound-force.\n\nTroy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries' weight are all built from the same basic unit, the grain, which is the same in all three systems. However, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure (all have ounces and pounds), the relationship between the grain and these other units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and troy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce (apothecaries' has scruple and dram, troy has pennyweight, and avoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled \"drachm\"). The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries'. The fluid dram unit of volume is based on the weight of 1 dram of water in the apothecaries' system.\n\nTo alleviate confusion, it is typical when publishing non-avoirdupois weights to mention the name of the system along with the unit. Precious metals, for example, are often weighed in \"troy ounces\", because just \"ounce\" would be more likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce.\n\nFor the pound and smaller units, the U.S. customary system and the British imperial system are identical. However, they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound. The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial system is identical to that in the U.S. customary system.\n\nIn the U.S., only the ounce, pound and short ton – known in the country simply as the ton – are commonly used, though the hundredweight is still used in agriculture and shipping. The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant and projectiles in small arms ammunition. It was also used to measure medicine and other very small masses.\n\nIn agricultural practice, a bushel is a fixed volume of 2150.42 cubic inches. The mass of grain will therefore vary according to density. Some nominal weight examples are:\n\nIn trade terms a bushel is a term used to refer to these nominal weights, although even this varies. With oats, Canada uses 34 lb bushels and the US uses 32 lb bushels.\n\nThe most common practical cooking measures for both liquid and dry ingredients in the U.S. are the teaspoon, tablespoon, and cup, along with halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths of these. Pounds, ounces, fluid ounces, and common sizes are also used, such as can (presumed size varies depending on product), jar, square (e.g., 1 oz of chocolate), stick (e.g., 4 oz butter), or fruit/vegetable (e.g., a half lemon, two medium onions).\n\nDegrees Fahrenheit are used in the U.S. to measure temperatures in most non-scientific contexts. The Rankine scale of absolute temperature also saw some use in thermodynamics. Scientists worldwide use the kelvin and degree Celsius. Several U.S. technical standards are expressed in Fahrenheit temperatures and American medical practitioners often use degrees Fahrenheit for body temperature.\n\nThe relationship between the different temperature scales is linear but the scales have different zero points, so conversion is not simply multiplication by a factor. Pure water freezes at 32 °F = 0 °C and boils at 212 °F = 100 °C at 1 atm. The conversion formula is:\n\nformula_1 or inversely as formula_2.\n\n\nSizing systems are used for various items in commerce, several of which are U.S.-specific:\n\nThe United States Code refers to these units as \"traditional systems of weights and measures\".\n\nOther common ways of referring to the system in the U.S. are: \"Customary\", \"Standard\", or, erroneously: \"English\", or \"Imperial\" (which refers to the post-1824 reform measures used throughout the British Empire). Another term is the foot–pound–second (FPS) system, as opposed to centimeter–gram–second (CGS) and meter–kilogram–second (MKS) systems.\n\nTools and fasteners with sizes measured in inches are sometimes called \"SAE bolts\" or \"SAE wrenches\" to differentiate them from their metric counterparts. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) originally developed fasteners standards using U.S. units for the U.S. auto industry; the organization now uses metric units.\n\n"}

{"id": "38497770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38497770", "title": "Wen-Ying Tsai", "text": "Wen-Ying Tsai\n\nWen-Ying Tsai (October 13, 1928 – January 2, 2013) was an American pioneer cybernetic sculptor and kinetic artist best known for creating sculptures using electric motors, stainless steel rods, stroboscopic light, and audio feedback control. As one of the first Chinese-born artists to achieve international recognition in the 1960s, Tsai was an inspiration to generations of Chinese artists around the world.\n\nWen-Ying Tsai was born in 1928 in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China and emigrated to the United States in 1950, where he attended the University of Michigan, receiving a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) in 1953. Moving to New York City after graduation, Tsai embarked on a successful career as an architectural engineer working for clients such as Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Synergetics, and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. While working as an engineer by day, Tsai pursued artistic studies at the Art Students League at night, while also taking courses in political science and economics at the New School for Social Research. Tsai also attended modern dance classes with Erick Hawkins.\n\nIn 1963, Tsai won a John Hay Whitney Fellowship for Painting, after which he decided to leave engineering and devote full-time to the arts. After a three-month trip in Europe, he returned to New York and began to make three-dimensional constructions using optical effects, fluorescent paints, and ultra-violet light. These wary works were later selected for \"The Responsive Eye\", an exhibition curated by William Seitz at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nUnsatisfied with his static sculptures, Tsai began to introduce movement using motors. He created \"Multi-kinetic Wall\" in 1965, which was exhibited in \"Art Turned On\" at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. Art historian Sam Hunter described the work:\n\nBut it was ultimately during a fellowship at the Edward MacDowell Colony in 1965 that Tsai had his \"Eureka!\" moment. While contemplating the sunlight shimmering in the trees, he had a sudden insight to use his engineering background to create art work that replicates natural phenomena. Finding a starting point in the work of constructivist artist Naum Gabo, Tsai took a quantum leap deciding that \"the shimmering was not enough\" and that what was needed was a way that the viewer could interact with the work. It was that inspiration that eventually lead him to the idea to use a stroboscope coupled with a feedback control system.:\n\nSam Hunter writes:\n\nDuring this time, along with international friends including Takis, Tsai was a founding member of the Art Workers' Coalition that sought to implement museum reform and underscore \"issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community.\"\n\nIn 1969, Tsai was invited by György Kepes to the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT. There, amongst the \"first Fellows\", a lively group of like-minded artists (including Jack Burnham, Otto Piene, Takis, Harold Tovish, Stan VanDerBeek), Tsai met Harold \"Doc\" Edgerton, the engineer who developed the modern electronic stroboscope.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Tsai moved with his family to Paris and showed with the Denise René Gallery and had extensive exhibitions in Europe. During these years, he befriended fellow Chinese artists residing in Paris including Peng Wants and Chu Teh-Chun and became very passionate about cultural exchange between China and the West. In 1979, Tsai and his friend the composer Wen-chung Chou were part of the first delegation of artists from the US to the People's Republic of China. This eventually lead Tsai and his wife Pei-De to establish The Committee for Chinese Artists Intercultural Movement (CCAIM), a pioneering non-profit organization that brought mainland Chinese artists to exhibit in the United States in the 1980s. After Paris, Tsai settled permanently in New York City. In 2006, Tsai and Pei-De established the Tsai Art and Science Foundation to support and bring awareness to endeavors that are at the intersection of the arts and sciences.\n\nTsai's cybernetic sculpture works have always been a challenge for writers to describe. Art critic Robert Hughes evokes them vividly:\n\nA grove of slender stainless-steel rods rises from a plate. This vase vibrates at 30 cycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set in a dark room, they are lit by strobes. The pulse of the flashing lights varies--they are connected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one approaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods appear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an eerie ballet of metal, whose apparent movements range from stillness to jittering, and back to a slow, indescribably sensuous undulation.\n\nThe philosopher Vilem Flusser wrote of Tsai's work:\n\nJonathan Benthall was one of the first to appreciate Tsai's sculpture. In 1968, he wrote:\n\nThe work of art may be regarded as a machine programmed by the artist to produce a deferred output. Its objective is survival--by survival I mean not continued acclamation but a continued ability to stand intact as the organized system that the artist originally intended. To survive it must operate within a culturally accepted genre of some kind. ... That is why an artist like Tsai is likely to be so valuable; not because he is an innovator (all his techniques taken separately have been used before) but because he has the kind of authority that establishes a stylistic tradition.\nTsai's interactive sculpture marked a major step in the development of kinetic art:\n\nA major portion of luminist and kinetic art originated in Europe, beginning with the formation in 1960 of GRAV (Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel)\nby eleven artists of different nationalities, all resident in Paris. Wen-Ying Tsai is an [American] associate who showed with that group at the Galerie Denise Rene, which made its reputation on technology art. Tsai is a Chinese-born sculptor now living in New York. The slender, stainless steel \"cybernetic\" rods of his sculpture vibrate in different patterns in response to electronic impulses, to the clapping of human hands, or to the flashes of a strobe light. In the artist's words, they are designed to simulate \"the intensity of a living creature.\" While the contemporary interest in light and kinetic sculpture is in a sense traditional, and dates back at least to Naum Gabo, to Marcel Duchamp, Moholy-Nagy and the Bauhaus, only in the postwar era has the artist tried consciously to use available computer and electronic technology to create robot works of art which can be activated environmentally.\n\nFrank Popper elaborates:\n\nAs far as the sensory experience of the spectator goes, the most outstanding American kinetic artist is unquestionably the Chinese-born Wen-Ying Tsai. His pieces, which are perfect on the technological level, serve the primary purpose of giving a complete visual experience to the spectator, whose sound solicitations provoke a choreographic, chromatic and rhythmic response in the 'cybernetic sculptures'. [...]\n\nGyörgy Kepes has commented enthusiastically on the 'magic rhythms emanating from this swaying, dancing steel trembling with life', and he has also noted the sense of 'an instant fellowship, a spontaneous celebration' which is re-created in their presence. As he concludes: 'Rhythm is friendship and in Tsai's work there is friendship of light, sound and our own heart-beats.'\nIf this appraisal testifies to the success with which Tsai affects the sensory and emotional responses of the spectator, we must not neglect the fact that he is also addressing himself to reason and the scientific element in his audience. In effect, the observer can enter an almost mathematical relationship with these works, and sharpen his perceptual powers through the exact assessment of the various aesthetic parameters of vibration, sound, colour, wave movement, etc.\n\nRichard Kostelanetz writes about Tsai's cybernetic water works:\n\nOf his other kinetic sculptures, \"Upward-Falling Fountain\" (1979) is the most impressive, creating an illusion that must be seen to be believed. As the water falling from a vibrating shower head is illuminated by a strobe, the droplets are caught dancing in response to sound; at certain strobe speeds, the droplets appear to be moving upwards, violating all rules of gravity. \"Living Fountain\" (1980-88) is a yet larger water sculpture, incorporating a showerhead three feet in diameter, plus three concentric circles of water jets, all installed above a basin twelve by sixteen feet. Here the strobe is designed to respond to combinations of changes in audible music, random sensors, audio-feedback controls, and a computer program. \n\nIn conclusion, Frank Popper writes in his \"Electra\" exhibition catalog about Tsai's essential contribution:\n\nThe role played by Tsai, the American artist of Chinese origin, in this context cannot be overestimated, in his most varied cybernetic sculptures in the \"Electra\" exhibition are perfect examples of an artistic comment, perhaps an artistic solution to one of the principal problems raised in this show: the situation of the artist between technology, at a critical point of its passage from the mechanical to the electronic era, and man's natural or artificial environment...\n\nThis transition from the stage of the electro-mechanical period and its art to the electronic era with its cultural manifestations is\naccompanied by a new assessment of the machine. If Oswald Sprengler rebelled against the fact the \"lord of the world\"\nbecame the slave of the machine, that civilization itself has become a machine which does everything mechanically, George Friedmann has observed that the worker has stopped being the servant of the machine to become its overseer. It is up to man's political intelligence, and to his intelligence alone, to decide to what ends he will use the power put at his disposal.\n\nVilem Flusser's analysis of Tsai's work delves into his place in both the Eastern and Western traditions.\n\nArt historian Donald Kuspit finds in Tsai's art a Taoist outlook:\n\nTsai met his wife, Pei-De Chang, in New York City in 1967. They were married in London in 1968 during the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition in which Tsai participated. The couple had twin sons two years later when Tsai was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT; their friend Otto Piene is fond of recalling that the Tsais' twins were the first of the \"Center babies.\"\n\nThe Tsai family spent part of the 1970s in Paris before settling down permanently in SoHo, New York where they lived in a loft space that they renovated themselves. Richard Kostelanetz has written about the Tsais in SoHo in his book \"SoHo: The Rise and Fall of an Artists' Colony\".\n\nTsai died in Manhattan, New York, on January 2, 2013. He was survived by his wife Pei-De; sons and spouses Lun-Yi London (Michelle) and Ming-Yi Gyorgy (Marloes); grandchildren Sakhaya, Kelsyn, and Lina. Artist Otto Piene and composer Wen-chung Chou were among those who spoke at Tsai's funeral service.\n\n\n\n1961 Ruth Sherman Gallery, New York\n\n1964 & 1965 Amel Gallery, New York\n\n1968 Howard Wise Gallery, New York\n\n1970 Alpha Gallery<br>\nMuseum Haus Lange, Krefeld, Germany\n\n1971 Hayden Gallery, Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>\nOntario Science Center, Toronto<br>\nGalérie Françoise Mayer, Brussels<br>\nUniversity of Pittsburgh<br>\nMichael Berger Gallery, Pittsburgh, PA\n\n1972 Galérie Denise René, Paris<br>\nCorcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC<br>\nGalérie Denise René, New York\n\n1973 Galérie Denise René/Hans Mayer, Düsseldorf. <br>\nMusee d'Art Contemporain, Montreal.\n\n1975 Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Caracas, Venezuela.\n\n1978 Wildenstein Art Center, Houston.<br>\nMuseo de Bellas Artes, Caracas.<br>\n\n1979 Hong Kong Museum of Art.\n\n1980 Isetan Museum of Art, Tokyo.\n\n1983 Galerie Denise Rene, Paris.\n\n1989 National Museum of History, Taipei.\n\n1990 Taiwan Museum of Art, Taichung, Taiwan.\n\n1997 National Museum of China, Beijing, China.\n\n1965<br>\n\"The Responsive Eye,\" Museum of Modern Art, New York<br>\n\"The New Eyes,\" Chrysler Art Museum, Provincetown, Massachusetts<br>\nCity Art Museum of St. Louis<br>\n\"Art in Science,\" Albany Institute of History and Art<br>\n\"Art Turned On,\" Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston.<br>\n\"Art in Science,\" organized by Smithsonian Institution, Washington\nDC<br>\nNational Academy of Science, Washington, DC<br>\n\n1968 <br>\n\"Cybernetic Serendipity,\" Institute of Contemporary Arts, London.<br>\n\"The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age\", Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\n1969<br>\n\"Cybernetic Serendipity,\" Corcoran Gallery of Art,\nWashington, DC<br>\n\"Howard Lipman Collection,\" Whitney Museum of\nAmerican Art, New York.<br>\n\"Master Pieces of Modern Art,\" Galerie Denise Rene/Hans\nMayer, Krefeld, Germany.<br>\n\"Explorations,\" Hayden Gallery, Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology<br> National Collection of Fine Arts, Smithsonian\nInstitution, Washington, DC<br>\n3e Salon International des Galeries Pilotes, Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts, Lausanne<br>\nMusee d'Art Moderne, Paris.<br>\nPittsburgh International, Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute,\nPittsburgh.<br>\n\"Struktur Schwingung Dynarnik,\" Kunsthalle, Nuremberg.<br>\n\"L'Art et les Technologies,\" Ville de Vitry-sur-Seine, France.<br>\n\"Multiple Interaction Team,\" Museum of Science and Industry,\nChicago<br>\n\"Salon International des Composants Electroniques,\" Paris.<br>\n\"Custom and Culture,\" US Custom House, New York.<br>\n\"Art of the Space Era,\" Huntsville Museum of Art, Alabama.<br>\n\"The Expanding Visual World,\" The Museum of Fun,\nAsahi Shimbun, Tokyo.\n\n1983<br>\"Electra,\" Musee d'Art Moderne, Paris.<br>\n\n1984 <br>\"Carte Blanche Denise Rene.\" Paris.<br>\n\n1986<br> \"Les Machines Sentimentales,\" Avignon.<br>\n\"La Biennale Di Venezia,\" Venice.<br>\n\"Energetic Art,\" La Malmaison, Cannes.<br>\n\n1987 <br>\"Artware, Kunst und Elektronik,\" Hanover International Fair.<br>\n\"Artware,\" Düsseldorf Landsmuseum.<br>\n\"Art in the Computer Age,\" Everson Museum of Art,\nSyracuse, New York.<br>\n\"Art in the Computer Age,\" Cincinnati Contemporary Art\nCenter, Cincinnati, Ohio.<br>\n\n1988 <br>\"Computers and Art,\" IBM Gallery of Science and Art,\nNew York.<br>\n\"Lights OROT,\" Yeshiva University Museum, New York.<br>\n\"Interaction,\" The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art,\nConnecticut.<br>\n\"Vraiment Faux,\" La Fondation Cartier, Jouey-en-Jossas,\nFrance.<br>\n\"Art Construit, Lumiere, Mouvement,\" EPAD, Galerie La\nDefense, Paris.<br>\n\"Art in the Computer Age,\" Center for the Fine Arts, Miami.<br>\n\n1989<br> \"Phenomena Art,\" Pan-Asian Expo '89, Saibu Gas Museum,\nFukuoka, Japan.<br>\nKSP, Kawasaka - Kanagawa Prefecture.<br>\n\"Visiona,\" Vienna Messe-WienerFestwochen.<br>\n\"Visiona,\" Zurich.\n\n1990 <br>\"Image du Futur,\" Montreal, Canada.\n\n1991 <br>\"ARTEC '91, The International Biennale in Nagoya.\"Japan.\n\n1995 <br>\"Kwangju International Biennale\" in Korea.<br>\n\"Osaka Triennale 1995\" - Sculpture.\n\n2001 <br>\n\"Denise René, l'intrépide,\" Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris\n\n2008 <br>\n\"Olympic Games, 2008,\" Beijing\n\n2010 <br>\n\"Expo 2010 Shanghai,\" Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai\n\n\n1968 <br>\nTsai, Cybernetic Sculpture at Howard Wise Gallery, Arts Magazine 42/8 (Summer). <br>\n\"Some More Beginnings,\" Experiments in Art and Technology.

Wish fulfillment can occur in dreams or in daydreams, in the symptoms of neurosis, or in the hallucinations of psychosis. This satisfaction is often indirect and requires interpretation to recognize.\n\nSigmund Freud coined the term () in 1900 in an early text titled \"The Interpretation of Dreams\". According to Freud, wish fulfillment occurs when unconscious desires are repressed by the ego and superego. This repression often stems from guilt and taboos imposed by society.

{"id": "17220009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17220009", "title": "Yves Peintures", "text": "Yves Peintures\n\nYves Peintures (Eng: \"Yves Paintings\") is an artist's book by the French artist Yves Klein, originally published in Madrid, 18 November 1954. \nThis publication was Klein’s first public gesture as an artist, featuring pages of 'commercially printed papers ' that were seemingly reproductions of paintings that, in fact, didn't exist. Using a practice started by Marcel Duchamp, this use of readymade objects to represent nothing but themselves has been referred to as an early example of Postmodernism, using a series of carefully executed strategies to undermine its own authority, and as a precursor to conceptual art. 'The simplicity of his readymades is at once sublime and mischievous.' \n\n\"The booklet asserts its character straightaway in the preface: a wordless text of unbroken horizontal lines with the same two paragraph indentations on each page... a homogenous continuum with no real beginning, middle, or end, and no content - at least insofar as there are no descriptions, analyses, or personalized utterances. The colour plates are similarly presented as anonymous entities, each a flat spatial field of an uninflected hue: turquoise, brown, purple, green, pink, gray, yellow, ultramarine, mint, orange, or red. Here, too, there is no attempt to represent or symbolize anything...\nThe booklet thus offers an utterly pared down presentation. Unlike most art books, it provides no reverential prose about the artist or the art, and no embellishing descriptions meant to convey meaning or context. Instead the booklet itself is made into a work of art that shares the same spirit of nothingness exemplified by the monochrome paintings that it features.\" Sidra Stich \n\nKlein had painted his first monochromes - paintings consisting of a single colour - whilst working in a framing shop in London in late 1949 which he exhibited in his room privately, inviting only friends. Initially influenced by his readings of Max Heindel's \"The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity\", which taught that 'space equals spirit and life, that matter is inert form, [and] that sponges and water symbolize the saturation of matter with spirit, he later rejected these teachings for a more rigorous study of the philosophy behind Judo, which involved long periods of meditation with his friends Arman and Claude Pascal.\n\nHis second private exhibition of monochromes took place whilst Klein was in Tokyo, late 1953, around the same time as he earned a diploma from the Kōdōkan Institute, as a fourth degree Dan, achieving the highest level possible for a European. \n\n'The philosophy of Zen, which is essentially prevalent in Kōdōkan judo, being primarily concerned with an increased sensitivity for the present and an extended concept of space and time, [meant] a new form of spirituality for Klein, and [had] a direct effect upon his artistic activities.' \n\nUpon his return to Paris in February 1954, he was deeply upset to discover that his diploma would not be officially recognised by the French Federation of Judo, meaning he could not officially teach or effectively participate in French Judo activities. He responded by publishing a book, \"Les Fondements du Judo\", (see ), studying six Katas formulated by Kanō Jigorō in the 19th century, in an attempt to establish a reputation in France by circumventing the federation. Unable to teach in France, he took a post in Madrid in May. It was whilst he was in Spain that he formulated and published his first public gesture as an artist: \"Yves Peintures\".\n\n\"Yves Peintures\" is a small booklet, 24.4 cm by 19.7 cm, containing 16 sheets of unbound paper, each printed on one side only and 10 containing tipped-in sheets of coloured paper. Starting with a preface of 3 pages consisting entirely of horizontal black lines designed to parody a traditional introduction credited to ‘Pascal Claude’, (Claude Pascal, a close friend of Klein’s), the introduction was actually designed by Klein himself, persuading Pascal to sign it to ‘certify the production’.\n10 vivid monochromatic plates follow, mechanically signed ‘Yves’, each given unspecified numerical dimensions and assigned a large city.\n\nIf, as is usual in exhibition catalogues, the dimensions refer to centimetres, the plates would represent medium-sized easel paintings; if metres, large frescoes; if millimetres, then the plates are life size, leading to the conclusion that, rather than illustrations, they are the work itself. Klein would later create work in all three categories.\n\nThe cities are all places Klein had lived and worked in the preceding 4 years, implying either that the idea for each work had come to him in the relevant city, or that the work was an abstract representation of the city’s atmosphere. There are three versions of the book; one in which the plates have the name Yves next to the cities with a date; one with additional information about the size of each work, and one in which the entire work is credited to 'Haguenault'.\n\n\"Haguenault Peintures\" is basically the same book, and was published at the same time, but attributed to a different, unknown, artist. Curiously, some of the plates are still mechanically signed ‘Yves’, part of a series of deliberate strategies to undermine the works’ integrity, leading some critics, such as Pierre Restany, to call Klein an early post-modernist. The main structural difference was the accrediting of ownership in the captions (Collection Particuliere, Collection Orickson, Collection Raymond Hains, etc.). This implies the (fictional) artist was a painter of some stature, with work collected in major collections. \nAccording to Raymond Hains, a close friend of Klein's at the time, Klein had named his pseudonym after a brand of gingerbread.\n“ The fact that there were two different monochrome artists featured in two nearly identical booklets augmented the manifestations of doubling, duplication and duplicity that lay at the core of the project.” Sidra Stich\n\nKlein was in contact at this time with key advocates of Lettrism, a group of French avant garde artists who were challenging the assumed authority of texts by creating ‘an experiential language that was to be the basis of (the) new culture.’ By 1952, he had seen various works by key members of the group, including Isidore Isou, and by Dufrêne, Gil J. Wolman & Guy Debord, and had become a close friend of Dufrêne in particular. The lettrists advocated challenging textual authority, and would serve as a direct reference point for the introduction. He was also familiar with the work of Marcel Duchamp, having given a copy of the 1947 artist's book \"Le Surrealisme\", designed by Duchamp with a famous cover of a 3D breast, to his friend Arman. Duchamp's theories about the readymade, and his belief in the viewer making the meaning of a work of art, would be central to \"Yves Peintures\".\n\n'[Klein] dismissed line as a ‘tourist walking across the space’. For him lines were a ‘prison grating’, whereas the fine individual particles of colour were an expression of ‘total freedom’. He attempted to free himself from all materiality through the totality of colour. In gold, red and especially dark, deep ultramarine blue he found colours that corresponded adequately to his visions of the immaterial and the infinite. He wanted to induce independent sensations, feelings and reactions in viewers without giving them a depicted object or an abstract sign as a starting-point, just by means of the state and effect of the colour. He saw monochrome as an ‘open window to freedom, as the possibility of being immersed in the immeasurable existence of colour’ Ulrike Lehmann \nThe book was published by Fernando Franco de Sarabia’s engraving workshop in Jaen near Madrid, in a numbered edition of 150; despite this, there are believed to only be around 10 copies in existence. \"Yves Peintures\" has since been re-published by Editions Dilecta, Paris in 2006 in an edition of 400.\n\nThe book seems to have had a small but influential impact on the Parisian Art scene; using \"Yves Peintures\" to gain entry into the Parisian art world, he managed to secure an exhibition of monochromes at the Club Des Solitaires, Paris, opening on October 15, 1955.\n\n'Yesterday night, Wednesday, we went into an abstract café… the abstractionists were there. They are easy to recognize because they give off an atmosphere of abstract painting, plus you see their paintings in their eyes. Maybe I’m delirious, but I have the impression I see things like that. In any event, we sat down with them. Then we began speaking of the book \"Yves Peintures\". Later, I went to get it from the car and I laid it down on the table. At the very first few pages the abstractionists’ eyes began to change. Their eyes lit up and in the depths, pure, beautiful single colors appeared.' Paris newspaper, dated January 13, 1955 \n\n\n"}
