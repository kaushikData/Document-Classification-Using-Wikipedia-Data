{"id": "2379141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2379141", "title": "5S (methodology)", "text": "5S (methodology)\n\n5S is a workplace organization method that uses a list of five Japanese words: , , , , and . These have been translated as \"Sort\", \"Set In order\", \"Shine\", \"Standardize\" and \"Sustain\". The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.\n\nIn some quarters, 5S has become 6S, the sixth element being safety.\n\nOther than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as \"visual control\", \"visual workplace\", or \"visual factory\". Under those (and similar) terminologies, Western companies were applying underlying concepts of 5S before publication, in English, of the formal 5S methodology. For example, a workplace-organization photo from Tennant Company (a Minneapolis-based manufacturer) quite similar to the one accompanying this article appeared in a manufacturing-management book in 1986.\n\n5S was developed in Japan and was identified as one of the techniques that enabled Just in Time manufacturing.\n\nTwo major frameworks for understanding and applying 5S to business environments have arisen, one proposed by Osada, the other by Hirano.\nHirano provided a structure to improve programs with a series of identifiable steps, each building on its predecessor. As noted by John Bicheno, Toyota's adoption of the Hirano approach was '4S', with Seiton and Seiso combined.\n\nA precursor development to the Japanese system of management was outlined by Alexey Gastev's development and the Central Institute of Labour (CIT) in Moscow.\n\nThere are five 5S phases. They can be translated from the Japanese as \"sort\", \"set in order\", \"shine\", \"standardize\", and \"sustain\". Other translations are possible.\n\nSeiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all unnecessary items from the location.\n\nGoals:\n\nImplementation:\n\nSeiton is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for fulfilling their function in the workplace.\n\nGoal:\n\nImplementation:\n\nSeiso is sweeping or cleaning and inspecting the workplace, tools and machinery on a regular basis.\n\nGoals:\n\nImplementation:\n\nSeiketsu is to standardize the processes used to sort, order and clean the workplace.\n\nGoal:\n\nImplementation:\n\nShitsuke or sustain the developed processes by self-discipline of the workers. Also translates as \"do without being told\".\n\nGoal:\n\nImplementation:\n\n5S methodology has expanded from manufacturing and is now being applied to a wide variety of industries including health care, education, and government. Visual management and 5S can be particularly beneficial in health care because a frantic search for supplies to treat an in-trouble patient (a chronic problem in health care) can have dire consequences.\nAlthough the origins of the 5S methodology are in manufacturing, it can also be applied to knowledge economy work, with information, software, or media in the place of physical product.\n\nThe output of engineering and design in a lean enterprise is information, the theory behind using 5S here is \"Dirty, cluttered, or damaged surfaces attract the eye, which spends a fraction of a second trying to pull useful information from them every time we glance past. Old equipment hides the new equipment from the eye and forces people to ask which to use\"\n\n"}

This is usually done through the state's Secretary of State's address or some other address which will legally substitute the agency's address for the victim's physical address on public records.\n\nAccording to the National Network to End Domestic Violence,\n\nAddress Confidentiality Programs (ACP) and Confidential Voter Listings are programs administered by the state enabling victims of domestic violence (and sometime victims of sexual assault and/or stalking) to participate in the voting process without fear of being found by their abusers. ACPs generally provide a substitute address for all public records. Confidential Voter Listings only provide confidentiality on election-related public records.\n\nThe rules implementing the Bank Secrecy Act require a financial institution to implement a Customer Identification Program that includes procedures that enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. The rules also require that a financial institution obtain a residential or business street address from each customer. Unfortunately, the substitute address under an Address Confidentiality Program does not meet the standards.\n\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a letter ruling to help the situation. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network regulations also allow: \"If the individual customer does not have a residential or business street address, then the rules permit the individual customer to provide a \"residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual.\"\n\nIn FIN-2009-R003, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network found: \"A customer who participates in a state-created ACP shall be treated as not having a residential or business street address and a secretary of state, or other state entity serving as a designated agent of the customer consistent with the terms of the ACP, will act as another contact individual for the purpose of complying with FinCEN's rules. Therefore, a financial institution should collect the street address of the ACP sponsoring agency for purposes of meeting its CIP address requirement.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55063170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55063170", "title": "Afro-pessimism", "text": "Afro-pessimism\n\nAfro-pessimism is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of racism, colonialism, and historical processes of enslavement including the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and embodied reality. \n\nThe term was first coined in 1990 in an article in \"Jeune Afrique Economie\" by Francophone Cameroonian author Sony Lab'ou Tansi. Writer and intellectual Frank B. Wilderson III developed the term in his political memoir about his time spent teaching and participating in the African National Congress in South Africa during apartheid. \n\nAccording to Tansi, \"Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time,\" which is the \"tragedy\" that Africa's position \"dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow\" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan). According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of \"accumulation and fungibility\" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.\n\nWilderson, along with Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Achille Mbembe, Jared Sexton, and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the Martinician psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer Frantz Fanon as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. \n\nAfro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a transcendent position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that pessimism might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of African descent. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical traumas of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling white supremacy would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the modern world.\n\nDiscussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an online context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, poetics, and computing.\n\nAfro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about pan-African identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent. Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the African Diaspora and peoples on the African continent. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of Afrocentricity as a move away from the colonialism and violence of Eurocentricity. The writings of Frantz Fanon, a Martinican psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. \n\nThe Pan-African movement négritude represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an existentialist position. A key figure in the movement, Aimé Césaire, uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.\n\nAfro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays post-colonial Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition. This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood. Scholar Toussaint Nothias has characterized these discussions by the components, \"essentialism, racialization, selectivity, ranking framework, and prediction.\" From this Afro-pessimistic perspective, news media that portray Africa and African people by the trope of victimhood, mirror the Eurocentric and ethnocentric of the Western media, language, images, and rhetoric. In this ways the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its going struggles with poverty, health-crisis, famine, and lack of modern development. The victimization is then visible in the humanitarian and development projects, which sometimes use the language of \"saving\" African people from such \"humanitarian disasters\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164556", "title": "Archon", "text": "Archon\n\nArchon (, \"árchon\", ἄρχοντες, \"árchontes\") is a Greek word that means \"ruler\", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning \"to rule\", derived from the same root as \"monarch\" and \"hierarchy\".\n\nIn the early literary period of ancient Greece the chief magistrates of various Greek city states were called \"Archon\". The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging from \"club leader\" to \"master of the tables\" at \"syssitia\" to \"Roman governor\". In Roman terms, \"archontes\" ruled by \"imperium\", whereas \"basileis\" (\"kings\") had \"auctoritas\".\n\nIn Athens a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the \"Archon Eponymos\", the \"Polemarch\", and the \"Archon Basileus\". According to Aristotle's \"Constitution of the Athenians\", the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient calendar systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as \"strategoi\". The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by \"junior Archons\", called \"Thesmothetes\". After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the Areopagus, though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.\n\nUnder the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed choregai (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays. Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus. The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the \"protagonist\"), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the \"archon eponymos\". The \"archon eponymos\" remained the titular head of state under democracy, though of much reduced political importance.\n\nByzantine historians usually described foreign rulers as \"archontes\". The rulers of the Bulgars themselves, along with their own titles, often bear the title \"archon placed by God\" in inscriptions in Greek.\n\nInside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the \"themata\": Dalmatia, Cephalonia, Crete and Cyprus. \"Archontes\" were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous Slavic-inhabited areas (\"sclaviniae\") under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, \"archontes\" are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an archontia (). The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the mint (), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.\n\nThe title of megas archon (\"grand archon\") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as \"grand prince\". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the Palaiologan period, but did not have any specific functions.\n\nFrom time to time, laity of the Orthodox Church in communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople have been granted the title of \"Archon\" to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to St Andrew. This \"Archon\" status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .\n\nAn Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the Orthodox Church (at large).\n\nIt is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the Orthodox Church faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with human rights and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.\n\nAs it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.\n\n\"Archon\" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as \"άρχοντας\" (\"archontas)\" to someone that holds a form of status, or power \n\nThe term is used within the Arab-speaking Copts in church parlance as a title for a leading member of the laity.\n\nVarious fraternities and sororities use the title of archon or variations on it.\n\nSome Gnostic sects used this term for demons associated with the planetspheres.\n\n"}

The term characteristically refers to a wealthy entrepreneur or investor who controls, through personal business ownership or dominant shareholding position, a firm or industry whose goods or services are widely consumed. Such individuals may also be called \"czars\", \"moguls\", \"proprietors\", \"tycoons\", \"taipans\", \"barons\", or \"oligarchs\".\n\nThe word \"magnate\" derives from the Latin \"magnates\" (plural of \"magnas\"), meaning \"a great man\" or \"great nobleman\".\n\nThe word tycoon derives from the Japanese word , which means \"great lord\", used as a title for the \"shōgun\". The word entered the English language in 1857 with the return of Commodore Perry to the United States. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln was humorously referred to as \"the Tycoon\" by his aides John Nicolay and John Hay. The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since.\n\nThe word \"mogul\" is an English corruption of \"mughal\", Persian or Arabic for \"Mongol\". It alludes to emperors of the Mughal Empire in the Medieval India, who possessed great power and storied riches capable of producing wonders of opulence such as the Taj Mahal.\n\nModern business magnates are entrepreneurs that amass on their own or wield substantial family fortunes in the process of building or running their own businesses. Some are widely known in connection with these entrepreneurial activities, others through high-visibility secondary pursuits such as philanthropy, political fundraising and campaign financing, and sports team ownership or sponsorship.\n\nThe terms \"mogul\", \"tycoon\" and \"baron\" were often applied to late 19th and early 20th century North American business magnates in extractive industries such as mining, logging and petroleum, transportation fields such as shipping and railroads, manufacturing such as automaking and steelmaking, in banking, as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the Second Industrial Revolution, the Gilded Age, or the Robber Baron Era.\nExamples of well-known business magnates in the western world include historical figures such as oilman John D. Rockefeller, automobile pioneer Henry Ford, shipping and railroad veterans Aristotle Onassis, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, and James J. Hill, steel innovator Andrew Carnegie, newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, retail merchant Sam Walton, and banker J. P. Morgan. Contemporary industrial tycoons include e-commerce entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, real estate developer Donald Trump, investor Warren Buffett, computer programmer Bill Gates, technology innovator Steve Jobs, steel investor Lakshmi Mittal, telecommunications investor Carlos Slim, airline owner Sir Richard Branson, technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, Formula 1 manager Bernie Ecclestone, media entrepreneur Rupert Murdoch, and poultry technologist Frank Perdue.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4722680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4722680", "title": "Camel's nose", "text": "Camel's nose\n\nThe camel's nose is a metaphor for a situation where the permitting of a small, seemingly innocuous act will open the door for larger, clearly undesirable actions.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Nunberg, the image entered the English language in the middle of the 19th century. An early example is a fable printed in 1858 in which an Arab miller allows a camel to stick its nose into his bedroom, then other parts of its body, until the camel is entirely inside and refuses to leave. Lydia Sigourney wrote another version, a widely reprinted poem for children, in which the camel enters a shop because the workman does not forbid it at any stage.\n\nThe 1858 example above says, \"The Arabs repeat a fable\", and Sigourney says in a footnote, \"To illustrate the danger of the first approach of evil habit, the Arabs have a proverb, 'Beware of the camel's nose.'\" However, Nunberg could not find an Arab source for the saying and suspected it was a Victorian invention.\n\nAn early citation with a tent is \"The camel in the Arabian tale begged and received permission to insert his nose into the desert tent.\" By 1878, the expression was familiar enough that part of the story could be left unstated. \"It is the humble petition of the camel, who only asks that he may put his nose into the traveler's tent. It is so pitiful, so modest, that we must needs relent and grant it.\"\n\nA 1909 essay by John B. West, founder of the West legal classification system, used the metaphor to describe the difficulty of trying to insert an otherwise innocuous set of facts into a rigid legal system:\nthree excellent digesters [] spent an entire day in disagreeing as to whether seal fishery cases should be classified under the topic 'Fish' or that of 'Game' ... It is the old story of the camel's head in the tent. What seems at first a plausible pretext for forcing some novel case or new principle into a topic or subdivision to which it does not naturally belong, leads to hopeless confusion.\n\nIn a 1915 book of fables by Horace Scudder, the story titled \"The Arab and His Camel\" ends with the moral: \"It is a wise rule to resist \"the beginnings of evil\".\"\n\nU.S. Senator Barry Goldwater used the metaphor in expressing his opposition to the National Defense Education Act in 1958:\n\nThis bill and the foregoing remarks of the majority remind me of an old Arabian proverb: \"If the camel once gets his nose in the tent, his body will soon follow.\" If adopted, the legislation will mark the inception of aid, supervision, and ultimately control of education in this country by the federal authorities.\n\nThe phrase was used in \"Reed v. King\" (193 CA Rptr. 130 - 1983): \"The paramount argument against an affirmative conclusion is it permits the camel's nose of unrestrained irrationality admission to the tent. If such an 'irrational' consideration is permitted as a basis of rescission the stability of all conveyances will be seriously undermined.\" The case in question involved a plaintiff suing because the defendant sold a house without telling them that the house's previous inhabitants had been brutally murdered 10 years earlier.\n\nThere are a number of other metaphors and expressions which refer to small changes leading to chains of events with undesirable or unexpected consequences, differing in nuances. \n"}
{"id": "6648008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6648008", "title": "Cat intelligence", "text": "Cat intelligence\n\nCat intelligence is the capacity of the domesticated cat to solve problems and adapt to its environment. Researchers have also shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behavior that applies previously learned knowledge to new situations, communicating needs and desires within a social group, and responding to training cues.\n\nThe brain of the domesticated cat is about long, and weighs . If a typical cat is taken to be long with a weight of , then the brain would be at 0.91% of its total body mass, compared to 2.33% of total body mass in the average human. Within the encephalization quotient proposed by Jerison in 1973, values above 1 are classified big brained, while values lower than 1 are small brained. The domestic cat is attributed a value of between 1–1.71 relative to human value that is 7.44–7.8. The largest brains in the Felidae family are those of the tigers in Java and Bali, of which the largest relative brain size within the \"panthera\" is the \"tigris\". It is debated whether there exists a causal relationship between brain size and intelligence in vertebrates. Correlations have been shown between these factors in a number of experiments. However, correlation does not imply causation. Most experiments involving the relevance of brain size to intelligence hinge on the assumption that complex behavior requires a complex (and therefore intelligent) brain; however, this connection has not been consistently demonstrated.\n\nThe surface area of a cat's cerebral cortex is approximately whereas the human brain has a surface area of about . Furthermore, a theoretical cat weighing has a cerebellum weighing , 0.17% of the total weight.\n\nAccording to researchers at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, the physical structure of the brains of humans and cats is very similar. The human brain and the cat brain both have cerebral cortices with similar lobes.\n\nThe number of cortical neurons contained in the brain of the cat is reported to be 763 million. Area 17 of the visual cortex was found to contain about 51,400 neurons per mm. Area 17 is the primary visual cortex.\n\nBoth human and feline brains are gyrencephalic, i.e. they have a surface folding.\n\nAnalyses of cat brains have shown they are divided into many areas with specialized tasks that are extremely interconnected and share sensory information in a kind of hub-and-spoke network, with a large number of specialized hubs and many alternative paths between them. This exchange of sensory information allows the brain to construct a complex perception of the real world and to react to and manipulate its environment.\n\nThe thalamus of the cat includes a hypothalamus, an epithalamus, a lateral geniculate nucleus, and additional secondary nuclear structures.\n\nThe domestic cat brain also contains the hippocampus, amygdala, frontal lobes (which comprise 3 to 3.5% of the total brain in cats compared to about 25% in humans), corpus callosum, anterior commissure, pineal gland, caudate nucleus, septal nuclei and midbrain.\n\nGrouse \"et al.\" 1979 ascertained the neuroplasticity of kittens' brains, with respect to control of visual stimulus correlated with changes in RNA structures. In a later study, it was found that cats possess visual-recognition memory, and have flexibility of cerebral encoding from visual information.\n\nA cognitive support diet for felines is a food that is formulated to improve mental processes like attention, short and long-term memory, learning, and problem solving. Claims for cognitive support appear on a number of kitten formulations to help with brain development, as well as diets aimed at seniors to help prevent cognitive disorders. These diets typically focus on supplying Omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, taurine, vitamins, and other supporting supplements that have positive effects on cognition.\n\nThe omega-3 fatty acids are a key nutrient in cognition for felines. They are essential for felines as they cannot be synthesized naturally and must be obtained from the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids that support brain development and function are alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oils, fish and other marine sources provide a very rich source of DHA and EPA. Alpha-linolenic acid can be acquired from oils and seeds.\n\nOmega-6 fatty acids are also needed in feline cognition diets. The important omega-6 fatty acid that plays a role in brain support and cognition is arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid or AA is found in animal sources such as meat and eggs. AA is required in cat diets, as felines convert insignificant amounts of it from linoleic acid due to the limited delta-6 desaturase. Like DHA, arachidonic acid is often found in the brain tissues of cats and seems to have a supporting role in brain function. In a 2000 study completed by Contreras \"et al.\", it was found that DHA and AA made up 20% of the fatty acids in the mammalian brain. Arachidonic acid makes up high amounts in the membrane of most cells and has many pro-inflammatory actions.\n\nTaurine is an amino acid, which is essential in cat diets due to their low capacity to synthesize it. Because taurine has the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier in the brain, it has been found to have a role in many neurological functions, especially in the visual development. Without taurine, felines can have an abnormal morphology in the cerebellum and visual cortex. When cats were fed a diet deficient in taurine, this leads to a decrease in the concentration of taurine in the retina of the eye. This results in deterioration of the photoreceptors, followed by complete blindness.\n\nCholine is a water-soluble nutrient that prevents and improves epilepsy and cognitive disorders. Supplementation is part of therapy for cats with seizures and Feline cognitive dysfunction, despite this treatment being mostly based on anecdotal evidence and research done on dogs. It is the precursor to nerve chemicals like dopamine and acetylcholine, making it important for proper functioning of the nervous system.\n\nIntelligence through behavioural observation is defined as a composite of skills and abilities.\nThe WAIS test is a measure of intelligence in adult \"homo sapiens\". The test scores on four criteria: verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory and processing speed. In a comparative evaluation from WAIS criteria, cats are generally fair in intelligence.\n\nIn controlled experiments, cats showed that they had fully developed concepts of object permanence, meaning that sensorimotor intelligence is completely developed in cats. For human infants, tests involving multiple invisible displacements of an object are used to assess the beginning of mental representation in the sixth and last stage of sensorimotor intelligence. The cats' searches on these tasks were consistent with representation of an unsensed object and fully developed sensorimotor intelligence. The working memory for object permanence of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiment as being of 16 hours.\n\nMore negative results were obtained in an experiment conducted in 2009 where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen. When presented with one string, cats had no trouble getting the treats, but when presented with multiple strings, some of which were not connected to treats, the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings, leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do.\n\nCats have complex dreams while sleeping, retaining and recalling long sequences of events while they are asleep, as many other animals do. A dreaming cat will usually have rapid, uncontrolled facial, whisker, paw, and abdominal movements. Occasionally cats have violent nightmares with muffled screams and may suddenly wake up screaming from the nightmare.\n\nTaken as a whole, cats have excellent memories. In experimental conditions, the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an information-retention or recall, of a duration totalling as much as 10 years. However, relationships with humans, individual differences in intelligence, and age may all affect memory. Cats easily adapt to their current environment because they can adapt their memories of past environments throughout their lives.\n\nThe period during which the cat is a kitten is the time when the cat learns and memorizes survival skills, which are acquired through observation of their mothers and playing with other cats. Playing, in fact, constitutes more than fun for a kitten, for it is essential for ranking social order, building hunting skills, and generally exercising for the adult roles.\n\nThe first two to seven weeks are a particularly critical time for kittens, for it is during this period that they bond with other cats. It has been suspected that without any human contact during this time, the cat would forever mistrust humans.\n\nJust as in humans, advancing age may affect memory in cats. Some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans. A slowing of function is normal, and this includes memory. Aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information. Cats lose brain cells as they age, just as humans do. The older the cat, the more these changes can affect its memory. There have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats, but there is some speculation that, just like people, short-term memory is more affected by aging. In one test of where to find food, cats' short-term memory lasted about 16 hours.\n\nDisease, such as feline cognitive dysfunction (FCD) – a condition similar to Alzheimer's disease in humans – could also affect cat memory. Symptoms of FCD include disorientation, reduced social interaction, sleep disturbances, and loss of house training. FCD causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment.\n\nEdward Thorndike conducted some key experiments on cat's learning capacity. In one of Thorndike's experiments, cats were placed in various boxes approximately 20 inches long, 15 inches wide, and 12 inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it. The cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by \"trial and error with accidental success.\" In one test the cat was shown to have done worse in a later trial than in an earlier one, suggesting that no learning from the previous trials was retained in long-term memory. Therefore, Thorndike considered the cat to have the capacity for learning due to the \"law of effect\", which states that responses followed by satisfaction (i.e. a reward) become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future. Thorndike was generally skeptical of the presence of intelligence in cats, criticising sources of the contemporary writing of the sentience of animals as \"partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of facts for investigation.\"\n\nAn experiment was done to identify possible observational learning in kittens. Kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a non-related adult cat, and sooner than the ones who, being placed in trial and error conditions, observed no other cat performing the act.\n\nCat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat. The process of domestication has allowed for closer observation of cat behaviour and in the increased incidence of interspecies communication, and the inherent plasticity of the cat's brain has become apparent as the number of studies in this have increased scientific insight. Changes in the genetic structure of a number of cats have been identified as a consequence of both domestication practises and the activity of breeding, so that the species has undergone genetic evolutionary change due to human selection (although this human selection has been coupled with an initial naturally occurring selective set of cats possessing characteristics desirable for the sharing of human habitation and living in Neolithic urban environments).\n\nCats' intelligence may have increased during their semi-domestication: urban living may have provided an enriched and stimulating environment requiring novel adaptive behaviours. This scavenging behaviour would only have produced slow changes in evolutionary terms, but such changes would have been comparable to the changes to the brain of early primitive hominids who co-existed with primitive cats (like, for example, Machairodontinae, Megantereon and Homotherium) and adapted to savannah conditions.\n\nCat's urban living is, however, unlikely to indefinitely improve the animal's intelligence: consider the fossil-based family tree of placental mammals above; the feline line diverged many years previously from the primate line; the cat both feral and domesticated is likely to be maintained in an evolutionary stasis by its niche position in the food web.\n\nCats are known to be trained to perform as circus animals. An example of this is The Yuri Kuklachev Cat Theatre based in Moscow, the owner of which has been training cats for many years to perform a range of circus-style tricks.\n\nIn November 2009, scientists claimed to simulate a cat's brain using a supercomputer containing 24,576 processors. This experiment did not simulate the function of the individual neurons in the brain, nor their synaptic patterns. It was intended to demonstrate that the problem of simulating a biological brain could be scaled to very large supercomputer platforms. However, the approach has been criticised as flawed.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for why the cat brain is a goal of computer simulations. Cats are familiar and easily kept animals, so the physiology of cats has been particularly well studied. The physical structures of human brains and cat brains are very similar. Cats, like humans, have binocular vision that gives them depth perception. Moreover, trying to build artificial mammal brains advances the research of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n"}

The first incidence of a professional charging of the mound has not been identified, but the practice dates back to the game's early days. Charging the mound is the most common initiator of a bench-clearing brawl.\n\nBefore charging, the batter usually throws his bat and helmet aside so that he may face the pitcher unarmed (it is a very serious breach of baseball etiquette, not to mention dangerous, for the batter to charge the mound with a bat). Though serious injuries have occurred from charging in the past, usually fights are either broken up or joined by all other players so the conflict turns into posturing and name-calling; in baseball parlance, this is known as a rhubarb.\n\nCharging the mound is typically about responding to an indignity rather than an attempt to injure the pitcher. There is long-standing etiquette in baseball regarding what is an acceptable offense to warrant a beaning, and there are similar \"unwritten rules\" for charging in response to being hit. While these unwritten rules have become more vague, the response of Major League Baseball to the incidents has become far more strict. Whereas suspensions in the past were rare and usually short, Commissioner Fay Vincent and his successor Bud Selig reacted harshly to both instances of beaning and charging during their respective tenures. Recently, most incidents which have caused the benches to clear have been met with large fines and lengthy suspensions.\n\nIn Japan, pitchers tip their cap to a batter hit by a pitch if it was not their intent to hit the batter to avoid a mound charging incident.\n"}
{"id": "227674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227674", "title": "Charismatic authority", "text": "Charismatic authority\n\nCharismatic authority is a concept about leadership that was developed by the German sociologist Max Weber. It involves a type of organization or a type of leadership in which authority derives from the charisma of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: legal authority and traditional authority. Each of the three types forms part of Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority.\n\n\"Charisma\" is an ancient Greek term that initially gained prominence through Saint Paul's letters to the emerging Christian communities in the first century. In this context, it generally referred to a divinely-originating \"gift\" that demonstrated the authority of God within the early leaders of the Church. Max Weber took this theological notion and generalized it, viewing it as something that followers attribute, thereby opening it up for use by sociologists who applied it to political, military, celebrity, and non-Christian religious contests. Other terms used are \"charismatic domination\" and \"charismatic leadership\".\n\nWeber applies the term charisma to \nCharismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a cult of personality often not by their own doing. \nLeadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the leader. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority's power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal organization, charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived legitimacy of the authority than Weber's other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a religious context might require an unchallenged belief that the leader has been touched by God, in the sense of a prophet. Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.\n\nIn contrast to the current popular use of the term \"charismatic leader\", Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of charism is founded on its \"recognition\" by the leader's followers (or \"adepts\" - \"Anhänger\"). \nHis charisma risks disappearing if he is \"abandoned by God\" or if \"his government doesn't provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates\".\n\nCharismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by traditional (coercive) or rational (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as revolutionary. Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called \"routinization\".\n\nBy routinization, the charismatic authority changes: \nA religion which evolves its own priesthood and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, Muhammad, who had charismatic authority as \"The Prophet\" among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of Islam, a clear example of routinization.\n\nIn politics, charismatic rule is often found in various authoritarian states, autocracies, dictatorships and theocracies. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast personality cult. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.\n\nBecause the authority is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of leadership or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.\n\nAccording to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma. These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.\n\n\"The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of authority.\" An example of this search method is the search for a new Dalai Lama. \"It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a reincarnation of the Buddha.\" This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be made to \"live on\" through a replacement.\n\n\"In this case the legitimacy of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection.\" The technique of selection is the \"modus operandi\" of the selection process. In ancient times, oracles were believed to have special access to \"divine judgment\" and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be legitimate. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle's endorsement.\n\nIn this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An excellent example is Joseph Stalin's claim that Vladimir Lenin had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin's charismatic authority.\n\n\"A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as 'election' or 'nomination'... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required.\" A case example of this form of succession is the papal conclave of cardinals to choose a new pope. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their Roman Catholic congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.\n\nCharisma can be perceived as \"a quality transmitted by heredity\". This method of succession is present in Kim il Sung's charisma being passed on to his son, Kim Jong Il. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward traditionalization and legalization in authority.\n\n\"The concept of charisma may be transmitted by ritual means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity.\" Priestly consecration is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, priests inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.\n\nWeber's model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.\n\nEileen Barker discusses the tendency for new religious movements to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge. Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.\n\nGeorge D. Chryssides asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.\n\nLen Oakes, an Australian psychologist who wrote a dissertation about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the \"adjective checklist\", and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut, Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of narcissism and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did however not fully follow Weber's framework of charismatic authority.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2999259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2999259", "title": "Choice-supportive bias", "text": "Choice-supportive bias\n\nIn cognitive science, choice-supportive bias or post-purchase rationalization is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected. It is a cognitive bias. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying those of option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B.\n\nWhat is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences. Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields memories that tend to be distorted in predictable ways. In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options. Once an action has been taken, the ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of what we did may be biased. It is believed this may influence our future decision-making. These biases may be stored as memories, which are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context. True and false memories arise by the same mechanism because when the brain processes and stores information, it cannot tell the difference where they came from.\n\nThe tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were, where people tend to over attribute positive features to options they chose and negative features to options not chosen.\n\nExperiments in cognitive science and social psychology have revealed a wide variety of biases in areas such as statistical reasoning, social attribution, and memory.\n\nChoice-supportive memory distortion is thought to occur during the time of memory retrieval and was the result of the belief that, \"I chose this option, therefore it must have been the better option.\" It is also possible that choice-supportive memories arise because an individual is only paying attention to certain pieces of information when making a decision or to post-choice cognitive dissonance. In addition, biases can also arise because they are closely related to the high level cognitive operations and complex social interactions.\n\nMemory distortions may sometimes serve a purpose because it may be in our interest to not remember some details of an event or to forget others altogether.\n\nThe objective of a choice is generally to pick the best option. Thus, after making a choice, a person is likely to maintain the belief that the chosen option was better than the options rejected. Every choice has an upside and a downside. The process of making a decision mostly relies upon previous experiences. Therefore, a person will remember not only the decision made but also the reasoning behind making that decision.\n\nMotivation may also play a role in this process because when a person remembers the option that they chose as being the best option, it should help reduce regret about their choice. This may represent a positive illusion that promotes well-being.\n\nThere are cases where an individual is not always in control of which options are received. People often end up with options that were not chosen but, instead were assigned by others, such as job assignments made by bosses, course instructors assigned by a registrar, or vacation spots selected by other family members. However, being assigned (random or not) to an option leads to a different set of cognitions and memory attributions that tend to favor the alternative (non-received) option and may emphasize regret and disappointment.\n\nPeople's conception of who they are can be shaped by the memories of the choices they make; the college favored over the one renounced, the job chosen over the one rejected, the candidate elected instead of another one not selected. Memories of chosen as well as forgone alternatives can affect one's sense of well-being. Regret for options not taken can cast a shadow, whereas satisfaction at having made the right choice can make a good outcome seem even better.\n\nChoice-supportive bias often results in memories that depict the self in an overly favorable light. In general, cognitive biases loosen our grasp on reality because the line between reality and fantasy can become fuzzy if one's brain has failed to remember a particular event.\nPositive illusions are generally mild and are important contributors to our sense of well being. However, we all need to be aware that they do exist as part of human nature.\n\nHuman beings are blessed with having an intelligent and complex mind, which allows us to remember our past, be able to optimize the present, and plan for the future. Remembering involves a complex interaction between the current environment, what one expects to remember, and what is retained from the past. The mechanisms of the brain that allow memory storage and retrieval serves us well most of the time, but occasionally gets us into trouble.\n\nThere is now abundant evidence that memory content can undergo systematic changes. After some period of time and if the memory is not used often, it may become forgotten.\n\nThere is extensive evidence that the amygdala is involved in effectively influencing memory. Emotional arousal, usually fear based, activates the amygdala and results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions.\nThe forebrain is one of the targets of the amygdala. The forebrain receives input from amygdala and calculates the emotional significance of the stimulus, generates an emotional response, and transmits it to cerebral cortex. This can alter the way neurons respond to future input, and therefore cognitive biases, such as choice-supportive bias can influence future decisions.\n\nEffects of stress-related hormones, such as epinephrine and glucocorticoids are mediated by influences involving the amygdala. It has been shown in experiments with rats that when they are given systemic injections of epinephrine while being trained to perform a task, they show an enhanced memory of performing the task. In effect the stronger the emotion that is tied to the memory, the more likely the individual is to remember. Therefore, if the memory is stored and retrieved properly it is less likely to be distorted.\n\nA PET scan or fMRI can be used to identify different regions of the brain that are activated during specific memory retrieval.\n\n\nStudies now show that as people age, their process of memory retrieval changes. Although general memory problems are common to everyone because no memory is perfectly accurate, older adults are more likely than younger adults to show choice-supportive biases.\n\nNormal aging may be accompanied by neuropathy in the frontal brain regions. Frontal regions help people encode or use specific memorial attributes to make source judgments, controls personality and the ability to plan for events. These areas can attribute to memory distortions and regulating emotion.\n\nIn general, older adults are more likely to remember emotional aspects of situations than are younger adults. For example, on a memory characteristic questionnaire, older adults rated remembered events as having more associated thoughts and feelings than did younger adults. As a person ages, regulating personal emotion becomes a higher priority, whereas knowledge acquisition becomes less of a powerful motive. Therefore, choice-supportive bias would arise because their focus was on how they felt about the choice rather than on the factual details of the options. Studies have shown that when younger adults are encouraged to remember the emotional aspect of a choice, they are more likely to show choice-supportive bias. This may be related to older adults' greater tendency to show a positivity effect in memory.\n\nOlder adults rely more than younger adults on categorical or general knowledge about an event to recognize particular elements from the event. Older adults are also less likely to correctly remember contextual features of events, such as their color or location. This may be because older adults remember (or rely on) fewer source identifying characteristics than the young. Consequently, older adults must more often guess or base a response on less specific information, such as familiarity. As a result, if they can't remember something, they are more likely to fill in the missing gaps with things that are familiar to them.\n\nOlder adults are more reliant on gist-based retrieval. A number of studies suggest that using stereotypes or general knowledge to help remember an event is less cognitively demanding than relying on other types of memorial information and thus might require less reflective activity. This shift towards gist-based processes might occur as a compensation for age decrements in verbatim memory.\n\nThe episodic memory and inhibition accounts of age-related increases in false memories. Inhibition of a memory may be related to an individual's hearing capacity and attention span. If the person cannot hear what is going on around them or is not paying much attention, the memory cannot be properly stored and therefore cannot be accurately retrieved.\n\nHenkel and Mather tested the role of beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen by giving participants several hypothetical choices like deciding between two used cars.\nAfter making several choices, participants left and were asked to return a week later. At that point, Henkel and Mather reminded them which option they had chosen for each choice and gave them a list of the features of the two options; some new positive and negative features were mixed in with the old features. Next, participants were asked to indicate whether each option was new, had been associated with the option they chose, or had been associated with the option they rejected. Participants favored whichever option Henkel and Mather had told them they had chosen in their memories. These findings show that beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen shape both which features are attributed to the options and how vividly they are remembered.\n\nOne study looked at the accuracy and distortion in memory for high school grades. The relation between accuracy and distortion of autobiographical memory content was examined by verifying 3,220 high school grades recalled by 99 freshman college students. It was shown that most errors inflated the actual high school grade, meaning that these distortions are attributed to memory reconstructions in a positive and emotionally gratifying direction. In addition, their findings indicate that the process of distortion does not cause the actual unpleasant memory loss of getting the bad grade. This is because there was no correlation found between the percentage of accuracy recall and the degree of asymmetry, or distortion. This shows that the distortion in memories of high school grades arises after the content has been forgotten by another mechanism.\n\nMany similar studies have been performed, such as a fifty-year study of remembering college grades. In this study one to 54 years after graduating, 276 alumni correctly recalled 3,025 of 3,967 college grades. The number of omission errors increased with the retention interval and better students made fewer errors. The accuracy of recall increased with confidence in recall. Eighty-one percent of errors of commission inflated the actual grade. These data suggested that distortions occur soon after graduation, remain constant during the retention interval, and are greater for better students and for courses students enjoyed most. Therefore, sometime in between when the memory is stored and when it is retrieved some time later, the distortion may arise.\n\nResearchers have used written scenarios in which participants are asked to make a choice between two options. Later, on a memory test, participants are given a list of positive and negative features, some of which were in the scenario and some of which are new. A choice-supportive bias is seen when both correct and incorrect attributions tend to favor the chosen option, with positive features more likely to be attributed to the chosen option and negative features to the rejected option.\n\nThe Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (DRM) consists of a participant listening to an experimenter read lists of thematically related words (e.g. table, couch, lamp, desk); then after some period of time the experimenter will ask if a word was presented in the list. Participants often report that related but non-presented words (e.g. chair) were included in the encoding series, essentially suggesting that they 'heard' the experimenter say these non-presented words (or critical lures). Incorrect 'yes' responses to critical lures, often referred to as false memories, are remarkably high under standard DRM conditions.\n\nThe theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. Choice-supportive bias is potentially related to the aspect of cognitive dissonance explored by Jack Brehm (1956) as postdecisional dissonance. Within the context of cognitive dissonance, choice-supportive bias would be seen as reducing the conflict between \"I prefer X\" and \"I have committed to Y\".\n\nA study of the \"Lady Macbeth\" effect showed reduced choice-supportive bias by having participants engage in washing.\n\n"}

Examples of linear polymers with intra-molecular contacts are nucleic acids and proteins. For defining the circuit topology, contacts are defined depending on the context. For proteins with disulfide bonds, these bonds could be considered as contacts. In a context where beta-beta interactions in proteins are more relevant, these interactions are used to define the circuit topology. As such, circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture. In particular, data from Hi-C and related technologies can be readily analysed using circuit topology framework. \n\nFor a chain with two binary contacts, three arrangements are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology can be described by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states, P, S and X. \n\nCircuit topology has implications for folding kinetics and molecular evolution. Circuit topology along with contact order and size are determinants of folding rate of linear polymers.

{"id": "4715998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4715998", "title": "Competition (biology)", "text": "Competition (biology)\n\nCompetition is an interaction between organisms or species in which both the organisms or species are harmed. Limited supply of at least one resource (such as food, water, and territory) used by both can be a factor. Competition both within and between species is an important topic in ecology, especially community ecology. Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure. Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. Competition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion. \n\nAccording to the competitive exclusion principle, species less suited to compete for resources should either adapt or die out, although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. According to evolutionary theory, this competition within and between species for resources is important in natural selection. However, competition may play less of a role than expansion among larger clades; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.\n\nCompetition occurs by various mechanisms, which can generally be divided into direct and indirect. These apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition. During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large aphids defend feeding sites on cottonwood leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources. For example, plants consume nitrogen by absorbing it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce soil nitrogen to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.\n\nInterference competition occurs directly between individuals via aggression etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat. An example of this can be seen between the ant \"Novomessor cockerelli\" and red harvester ants, where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their colonies with small rocks.\n\nExploitation competition occurs indirectly through a common limiting resource which acts as an intermediate. For example, use of resources depletes the amount available to others, or they compete for space.\n\nApparent competition occurs indirectly between two species which are both preyed upon by the same predator. For example, species A and species B are both prey of predator C. The increase of species A may cause the decrease of species B, because the increase of As may aid in the survival of predator Cs, which will increase the number of predator Cs, which in turn will hunt more of species B.\n\nCompetition varies from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size-asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.\n\nCompetition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.\n\nSpecies also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.\n\nIntraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same resources in an ecosystem.\n\nInterspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of cheetahs and lions; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs. Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called 'intraguild predation'. For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).\n\nAn example among protozoa involves \"Paramecium aurelia\" and \"Paramecium caudatum.\" Russian ecologist, Georgy Gause, studied the competition between the two species of \"Paramecium\" that occurred as a result of their coexistence. Through his studies, Gause proposed the Competitive exclusion principle, observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped.\n\nCompetition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.\n\nIn evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the selection of traits which promote success in particular environments. The theory originates from work on island biogeography by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson.\n\nIn r/K selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: \"r\"- or \"K\"-selection. These terms, r and K, are derived from standard ecological algebra, as illustrated in the simple Verhulst equation of population dynamics:\n\nwhere \"r\" is the growth rate of the population (\"N\"), and \"K\" is the carrying capacity of its local environmental setting. Typically, r-selected species exploit empty niches, and produce many offspring, each of whom has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, K-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and invest more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.\n\nTo explain how species coexist, in 1934 Georgii Gause proposed the competitive exclusion principle which is also called the Gause principle: species cannot coexist if they have the same ecological niche. The word \"niche\" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction. These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper habitat conditions (like temperature or pH). Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources. If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area. Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist.\n\nCompetition can cause species to evolve differences in traits. This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition. These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors. Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations. For example, Darwin's finches can be found alone or together on the Galapagos Islands. Both species' populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present. However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate sized seeds. Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks. Different finch species can coexist if they have traits—for instance, beak size—that allow them to specialize on particular resources. When \"Geospiza fortis\" and \"Geospiza fuliginosa\" are present on the same island, \"G. fuliginosa\" tends to evolve a small beak and \"G. fortis\" a large beak. The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement. For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species. Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.\n\n\n"}

When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.\n\nThus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:\n\nJurists such as Mickey Dias and Hohfeld have declared that rights and duties are \"jural corelatives\", which means that if someone has a right, \"someone else\" owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in \"Murphy v Brentwood District Council\" (1991) to disapprove Lord Denning MR's judgment in \"Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council\" (1972).\n\n\n"}

Synchronic digraphia is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language, while diachronic (or sequential) digraphia is the replacement of one writing system by another for a particular language.\n\nAn example of synchronic digraphia is Serbian, which is equally written in both Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and Gaj's Latin alphabet, and practically all speakers of Serbian can read and write both scripts. Another example is Punjabi which uses two different writing systems: Gurmukhi script, used in Punjab in India, and Shahmukhi (an Arabic script), though there is no difference when both of these scripts are read or pronounced. Konkani is written in no fewer than three scripts; Devnagari, Kannada and Roman. \n\nAn example of diachronic digraphia is Turkish, which replaced a Perso-Arabic writing system with a Latin-based system in 1928.\n\nDigraphia has implications in language planning, language policy, and language ideology.\n\n\"Digraphia\" \"using two writing systems for the same language\" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts.\n\nEnglish \"digraphia\", like French \"digraphie\", etymologically derives from Greek \"di-\" \"δι-\" \"twice\" and \"-graphia\" \"-γραφία\" \"writing\".\n\n\"Digraphia\" was modeled upon \"diglossia\" \"the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population\", which derives from Greek \"diglossos\" δίγλωσσος \"bilingual.\" Charles A. Ferguson, a founder of sociolinguistics, coined \"diglossia\" in 1959. Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has \"introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia,\" such as distinguishing \"high\" and \"low\" varieties. Peter Unseth notes one usage of \"digraphia\" that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, \"shorthand in English, pinyin in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\", which does not yet include \"digraphia\", enters two \"digraph\" terms and \"digraphic\". First, the linguistic term \"digraph\" is defined as, \"A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech\". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in orthography (e.g., English \"ng\" representing the velar nasal ) and a single grapheme with two letters in typographical ligature (e.g., the Old English Latin alphabet letter æ). Second, the graph theory term \"digraph\" (a portmanteau from directed graph) is defined as, \"A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements.\" The two \"digraph\" terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The \"OED2\" defines two \"digraphic\" meanings, \"Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph\" and \"Written in two different characters or alphabets.\" It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning \"digraphia\"). Isaac Hollister Hall, an American scholar of Oriental studies, described an Eteocypriot language publication as \"bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language).\" Hall's article was antedated by Demetrios Pieridis's 1875 usage of \"digraphic\" instead of \"bilingual\" for an inscription written in both the Greek alphabet and Cypriot syllabary.\n\nEnglish \"digraphic\" and \"digraphia\" were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, Julius Oppert introduced \"digraphique\" to describe languages written in cuneiform syllabaries. In 1893, Auguste Barth used French \"digraphisme\" for Cambodian inscriptions written in Khmer script and Brāhmī script. In 1971, Robèrt Lafont coined \"digraphie\" regarding the sociolinguistics of French and Occitan.\n\nAlthough the word \"digraphia\" is new, the practice is ancient. Darius the Great's (c. 522-486 BCE) Behistun Inscription was written in three cuneiform scripts for Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian.\n\nFour authors independently neologized English \"digraphia\" from \"diglossia\".\n\nThe Songhay linguist Petr Zima (1974) first used \"digraphia\" to describe the Hausa language having two writing systems, Boko (Latin script) and Ajami script (Arabic script). Zima differentiated these paired situations.\nUsage of \"diorthographia\" is unusual. Compare dysgraphia meaning \"a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write\" and dysorthographia \"a synonym for dyslexia\".\n\nThe anthropologist James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used \"digraphia\" to describe the practice of writing brand names in all caps (e.g., ARRID). He described digraphia as \"the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia\", and defined it as \"different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community.\"\n\nThe sociolinguist Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, \"the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language.\"\n\nThe sinologist and lexicographer John DeFrancis (1984) used \"digraphia\", defined as \"the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language,\" to translate Chinese \"shuangwenzhi\" (雙文制 \"two-script system\") of writing in Chinese characters and Pinyin. DeFrancis later explained, \"I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term \"digraphia\", which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson’s \"diglossia\" in speech.\"\n\nHegyi coined and suggested the terms \"bigraphism\" and \"multigraphism\", but he only used them in a footnote (fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying \"the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed.\"\n\n\"Digraphia\" is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the Corpus of Contemporary American English, which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists \"digraphia\" three times in \"academic genre\" contexts.\nStéphane Grivelet, who edited a special \"Digraphia: Writing systems and society\" issue of the \"International Journal of the Sociology of Language\", explains.\nAfter 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.\n\nDigraphia has some rare synonyms. Orthographic diglossia antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971.\" Bigraphism, bialphabetism, and biscriptality are infrequently used.\n\nSome scholars avoid using the word \"digraphia\". Describing terminology for \"script obsolescence,\" Stephen D. Houston, John Baines, and Jerrold Cooper say, \"'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts.\"\n\nDigraphia can be either \"synchronic\" (or \"concurrent\") or \"diachronic\" (\"historical\" or \"sequential\"), extending Ferdinand de Saussure's classic division between synchronic linguistics and diachronic linguistics. Dale first differentiated \"diachronic (or historical) digraphia\" (\"more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time\") and \"synchronic digraphia\" (\"more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language\"). Dale concluded that,\nTwo primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups of speakers of the language in question [ … ] Diachronic digraphia results when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different times.\nSome recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, \"digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.\n\nPeter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script.\n\nLinguists who study language and gender have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties (\"genderlects\", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese \"hiragana\" was initially a women's script, for instance, used by Murasaki Shikibu to write \"The Tale of Genji\". Chinese Nüshu script (literally \"women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in Jiangyong County of Hunan province.\n\nNot only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many heavy metal bands (e.g., Motörhead, Infernäl Mäjesty, Mötley Crüe) use umlauts \"to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‘Gothic’ more generally.\" This digraphic usage is called the \"metal umlaut\" (or \"röck döts\").\n\n\"Synchronic digraphia\" is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the Serbian language, which is written in either the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet or Gaj's Latin alphabet. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim Bosniaks generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably Bosnian Cyrillic. Inuktitut is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and Inuktitut syllabics. In Hindi-Urdu, the Devanagari or Persian script generally follows the Hindi and Urdu standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.\n\nThe Japanese writing system has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: \"true digraphia\" of occasionally using \"rōmaji\" Latin alphabet for a few loanwords like \"DVD\", and of regularly using three scripts (technically, \"trigraphia\") for different functions. Japanese is written with \"kanji\" \"Chinese character\" logographs used for Sino-Japanese vocabulary; \"hiragana\" used for native Japanese words; and \"katakana\" used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis. Take \"Nihon\" for instance, the primary name of Japan. It is normally written 日本 (literally, \"sun's origin\") in \"kanji\" – but is occasionally written にほん in \"hiragana\", ニホン in \"katakana\", or Nihon in \"rōmaji\" (\"romanization\"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.\n\nAnother example is the Malay language, which most often uses the Latin alphabet, while in certain geographic areas (Kelantan state of Malaysia, Brunei) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called Jawi. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across Malay Archipelago since the introduction of Islam. In Java, Javanese people, which predominantly ruled by Hindu and Buddha kingdoms, have their own writing system called Hanacaraka. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called Pegon) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.\n\nAn element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised.\n\nDigraphia is controversial in modern Written Chinese. The ongoing debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters concerns \"diglyphia\" or \"pluricentricity\" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both Chinese characters and Hanyu Pinyin romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names. Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels. Among Chinese input methods for computers, Pinyin is the most popular phonetic method. Zhou Youguang predicts, \"Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing.\" Many writers, both from China (e.g., Mao Dun and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, Victor H. Mair, J. Marshall Unger, and William Hannas) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized used of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. \nYat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: Putonghua and topolects (or \"dialects\"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.\n\n\"Diachronic\" or \"sequential digraphia\", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through language change or suddenly through language reform. \"Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries).\"\n\nThe Azerbaijani language provides an \"extreme example\" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in runic, Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.\n\nThere are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are Romanian (which originally used Cyrillic and changed to Latin) in the 1860s; Vietnamese (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called Chữ Nôm to the Latin alphabet); Turkish, Swahili, Somali, and (partially) Malay, which all switched from Arabic script to the Latin alphabet, and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the Cyrillic script after the dissolution of the USSR such as Moldova, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, \"The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses.\"\n\n\n"}

Its principal purpose is to assess the potential risk of harm to the hypothetical occupant as he or she impacts the interior of the passenger compartment and, ultimately, the efficacy of an experimental roadside feature undergoing full-scale vehicle crash testing.\n\nThe FSM eliminates the complexity and expense of using instrumented anthropometric dummies during the crash test experiments. Furthermore, while crash test dummies were developed to model collisions between vehicles, they are not accurate when used for the sorts of collision angles that occur when a vehicle collides with a roadside feature; by contrast, the FSM was designed for such collisions.\n\nThe FSM is based on research performed at Southwest Research Institute in 1980 and published in 1981 in the paper entitled \"Collision Risk Assessment Based on Occupant Flail-Space Model\" by Jarvis D. Michie. The FSM (coined by Michie) was accepted by the highway community and published as a key part of the \"Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances\" published in 1981 in National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 230. In 1993, the NCHRP Report was updated and presented as NCHRP Report 350; in this research effort performed by the Texas Transportation Research Institute, the FSM was reexamined and was unmodified in the new publication. In 2004, Douglas Gabauer further examined the efficacy of the FSM in his PhD thesis. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) retained the FSM as the method of assessing the risk of harm to vehicle occupants in the 2009 \"Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware\" that replaced NCHRP Report 350, stating that the FSM had \"served its intended purpose well\".\n\nThe FSM hypothesis divides the collision into two stages. In stage one, the unrestrained occupant is propelled forward and sideways in the compartment space due to vehicle collision accelerations and then impacts one or more surfaces (including the steering wheel) with velocity \"V\". According to the model, the vehicle (instead of the occupant) is the object that is accelerating. The occupant experiences no injury-producing force prior to contact with the compartment surfaces.\n\nIn stage two, the occupant is assumed to remain in contact with the compartment surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of the collision. The occupant may sustain injury at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two. The occupant impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry. Finally, the hypothetical occupant impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of human tolerance to these forces.\n"}

Bennett, Harvey L. Smith and Herbert Passim. In the 1920s and 1930s, agricultural scientists and rural sociologists, usually under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture, had undertaken various studies of food habits of the rural poor, with the aim of improving them. With the advent of World War II, these efforts increased. Those with information to share about different food habits were encouraged to contact the anthropologist Margaret Mead at the National Research Council. \n\nIt was in these circumstances that John W. Bennett and his companions went to study Anglo-Americans, German-Americans and African-Americans in the fertile but frequently flooded bottomlands of southern Illinois along the banks of the Mississippi. All depended on white bread, pork, and potatoes. To the investigators these habits, particularly the spurning of plentiful, nutritious foods such as fish, seemed irrational. They argued \"The illusion of an 'economic man,' searching out the most obscure foodstuffs from an unwilling Nature in the reasoned pursuit of complete fulfillment of his needs, must give way to the concept of a man conditioned by the preferences and prejudices of his neighbors, selecting only those foods sanctioned by the 'culture.'\" Presumably they chose the term 'foodways' by analogy with the term 'folkways.' This had gained currency in the United States following its adoption by Yale professor and pioneering social scientist William Graham Sumnner. Since folkways were established by use, not reason, they were resistant to change and not easily altered by government intervention. Similarly, Bennett et al. concluded, foodways were not likely to change in just because bureaucrats suggested that new ways had economic or nutritional benefits. \n\nThe term 'foodways' was little used until late 1960s and early 1970s and the surge in folklife research, including the establishment of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1967. As the field of Foodways develops, scholars offer their own definitions: \"Contemporary scholarship defines foodways as the study of what we eat, as well as how and why and under what circumstances we eat it. As folklorist Jay Anderson argued in a pioneering 1971 essay, foodways encompasses “the whole interrelated system of food conceptualization and evaluation, procurement, preservation, preparation, consumption and nutrition shared by all the members of a particular society. This broad definition embraces both historical and regional differences while simultaneously pointing to the importance of food events (barbecues, Brunswick stew suppers, oyster roasts), food processes (ham curing, snap-bean canning, friend apple pie making), and even the aesthetic realms that touch upon the world of food (country songs about food, quilts raffled at community fish fries, literary references to eating).\" - John T. Edge \n\nAnthropologists, folklorists, sociologists, historians, and food scholars often use the term foodways to describe the study of why we eat what we eat and what it means. The term, therefore, looks at food consumption on a deeper than concrete level and includes, yet goes, beyond sustenance, recipes, and/or taste. Thus, according to Harris, Lyon and McLaughlin: “…everything about eating including what we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it and who’s at the table – is a form of communication rich with meaning. Our attitudes, practices and rituals around food are a window onto our most basic beliefs about the world and ourselves.” \n\nTopics like social inclusion and exclusion, power, and sense making are explored under the umbrella term foodways. Furthermore, the ways in which food shapes and is shaped by social organization are essential to examination of foodways. Since consumption of food is socially constructed, cultural study is also incorporated in the term.\n\nAnthropologist Mary Douglas, explains: “A very modest life of subsistence contrasts with our own use of goods, in for example, the use of food. How would we be able to say all of the things we want to say, even just to the members of our families, about different kinds of events and occasions and possibilities if we did not make any difference between breakfast and lunch and dinner and if we made no difference between Sunday and weekends, and never had a different kind of meal when friends came in, and if Christmas Day had also to be celebrated with the same kind of food?” \n\nWhile in fields like anthropology, the production, procurement, preparation, presentation, and consumption of foods have always been regarded as central in the study of cultures the use of the term foodways in popular culture is used as an oriented way of looking at food practices. In this sense, the term is a consumer culture expression that encompasses, in popularly understandable and debatable formats, contemporaneous social practices related to foods as well as nutritional and culinary aspects of foods.\n\nThe term foodways can be employed when referencing the \"ways of food\" of a region or location. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigrant foodways are also featured prominently in America. For example, The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, located in Southeastern Massachusetts - which has a very large immigrant population from Cape Verde - describes Cape Verdean Foodways by publishing recipes from these southern Atlantic islands.\n\nIn contrast to the anthropological treatments of food, the term foodways aims at a highly cross-disciplinary approach to food and nutrition. For example, the refereed journal \"Food and Foodways\", published by Taylor & Francis, is \"devoted to publishing original scholarly articles on the history and culture of human nourishment. By reflecting on the role food plays in human relations, this unique journal explores the powerful but often subtle ways in which food has shaped, and shapes, our lives socially, economically, politically, mentally, nutritionally, and morally. Because food is a pervasive social phenomenon, it cannot be approached by any one discipline\".\n\nIn consumer culture research, contemporary and postmodern foodways are topics of interest. In an article in the journal \"Consumption Markets & Culture\", from Taylor & Francis publications, Douglas Brownlie, Paul Hewer, and Suzanne Horne explore culinary consumptionscapes through a study of contemporary cookbooks, with chic recipes often turning intensely into a kind of \"gastroporn\", creating a \"simulacrum of desire\" as well as a \"simulacrum of satisfaction.\"\n\nHistorical studies of foodways help scientists, anthropologists, and scholars gain insight into past cultures. Springer Publishing has released the book, \"Pre-Columbian Foodways\", by John Staller and Michael Carrasco, which studies and examines \"the symbolic complexity of food and its preparation, as well as the social importance of feasting in contemporary and historical societies.\" Books like this help further the study of foodways and increase public awareness.\n\n"}

It is built on the three base quantities length, time and force with base units metre, second and kilopond respectively. Internationally used abbreviations of the system are MKpS, MKfS or MKS (from French or ).\nHowever, the abbreviation MKS is also used for the MKS system of units, which, like the SI, uses mass in kilogram as a base unit.\n\nNowadays, the mass as a property of an object and its weight, which depends on the gravity of the earth at its position are strictly distinguished. However historically, the kilopond was also called kilogram, and only later the kilogram-mass (today's kilogram) was separated from the kilogram-force (today's kilopond). A kilopond originally referred to the weight of a mass of one kilogram. Since the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth can differ, one gets different values for the unit kilopond and its derived units at different locations. To avoid this, the kilopond was first defined at sea-level and a latitude of 45 degrees, since 1902 via the standard gravity of .\n\nFurther disadvantages are inconsistencies in the definition of derived units such as horsepower (1 PS = 75 kp⋅m/s) and the missing link to electric, magnetic or thermodynamic units.\n\nIn Germany, the kilopond lost its legal status as a unit of force on the first of January 1978 and is replaced by SI units. A kilopond can be converted to the SI unit Newton by multiplication with the standard acceleration \"g\":\n\nIn English contexts the unit of force is usually formed by simply appending the suffix \"force\" to the name of the unit of mass, thus \"gram-force\" (gf) or \"kilogram-force\" (kgf, which follows the tradition of pound-force (lbf). In other, international contexts the special name \"pond\" (p) or \"kilopond\" (kp) respectively is more frequent.\n\nThe hyl, metric slug (mug), or TME (German: technische Masseneinheit, technical mass unit), is the mass that accelerates at 1 m/s under a force of 1 kgf. The hyl has also been used as the unit of mass in a metre–gram-force–second (mgfs) system.\n\nThe (only) gravitational unit of pressure is the technical atmosphere (at). It is the gravitational force of one kilogram, i.e. 1 kgf, exerted on an area of one square centimetre.\n\nThere is no dedicated name for the unit of energy, “metre” is simply appended to “kilopond”, but usually the symbol of the kilopond-metre is written without the middle dot.\n\nIn 19th-century France there was as a unit of power, the poncelet, which was defined as the power required to raise a mass of 1 quintal (1 q = 100 kg) at a velocity of 1 m/s. The German or metric horsepower (PS, \"Pferdestärke\") is arbitrarily selected to be three quarters thereof.\n"}

The \"Homo magi\" first appeared in \"Justice League of America\" #164 (March 1979), and were created by Gerry Conway and Dick Dillin.\n\nThe \"Homo magi\" first appeared as \"The Hidden Ones\" in \"Justice League of America\" #164 (March 1979). They are referred to as \"Homo magus\" in issue #165, and as \"Homo magi\" in #166. In the storyline, Justice League member Zatanna is searching for her mother Sindella along with her father Giovanni Zatara. The \"Homo magi\" were also featured in the pages of \"Secret Origins\" vol. 2 #27 (June 1988) written by Jean-Marc Lofficier (credited as Ehrich Weiss), Randy Lofficier, and Roy Thomas.\n\nAccording to the Lofficiers, their story in \"Secret Origins\" that re-told the origins of the \"Homo magi\" was revised heavily prior to publication; this is their reason for using a pseudonym. \n\nIn the original plot, Nommo, a sorcerer from the Empire of \"Kor\" in Ancient Africa, (from H. Rider Haggard's \"She\") created the \"Flame of Life\" from the life forces gathered after the sinking of Atlantis. Nommo later fought Wotan (changed to Felix Faust by DC), unwittingly causing the destruction of Kor when he absorbed the full power of the Flame.\n\nChanging his name to Doctor Mist, Nommo embarked on a breeding plan to foster the creation of a race of sorcerers known as \"Homo magi\". As part of his centuries - spanning scheme, Dr. Mist created the various \"Stones of Power\" used by Arak, Doctor Occult (not a \"Homo magi\"), Sargon, Zatara, etc. and the Global Guardians after World War II. Zatanna is the final product of Dr. Mist's plan for a perfect mate. But Wotan (Felix Faust) returns to steal his power and take revenge.\n\nHomo Magus is a sub-race of naturally magic-wielding humans. According to Doctor Mist, the Homo magi evolved in a parallel but separate line, alongside Homo sapiens. Homo magi are naturally adept at magic; since many humans possesses the Homo Magi gene because of their relationships in the distant past, these humans can learn to use indirect magic by perform rituals, but pure Homo Magi or their direct descendants can use direct magic, too.\n\nThe Homo magi existed for as long as the human race, but due to their special abilities, they did not expand as the Homo sapiens. Eventually, they started to inbreed with normal humans, resulting in many generations of Homo magi turned to Homo sapiens. As the number of pure Homo magi dwindled, they decided to recede and went into hiding.\n\nDarkworld was a dimension created by an unnamed cosmic entity who later fell into a deep sleep. This entity's dreams were responsible for creating the first Lords of Chaos and Lords of Order, Chaon (chaos), Gemimn (order), and Tynan the balancer. These beings and others became the gods of Atlantis. Darkworld was tethered to Atlantis by a massive chain created by Deedra goddess of nature, much in the same way Ifé, the home dimension of the Orishas, is tethered to Earth by an iron chain. \n\nIn the DC Universe the Homo magi apparently originated on the lost continent of Atlantis. The continent was a focal point for unharnessed magical energies (wild magic), and the local Homo sapiens evolved into Homo Magi as a result of their exposure to these energies. Those humans who gained these inherent mystic abilities interbred for thousands of years, concentrating and strengthening the genetic predisposition. Upon the fall of Atlantis, people who carried the predisposition scattered to the four winds. Many humans today are descended from Homo magi. \n\nHomo magi are genetically compatible with normal humans, and are genetically identical to normal humans. The mysterious property that makes them homo magi is somehow \"dominant\" like a gene, the child of a normal human and a Homo magi will always be Homo magi. How and why this trait expresses itself the way it does has yet to be recorded. Apparently that altered Atlantean genome is the difference between Homo magi and regular human magic users. Sindella (Zatanna's mother), Arion, Atlan and Tempest are all famously powerful magic users and presumably all Homo magi. Known offspring of Homo magi are Zatanna, daughter of Sindella and the original John Zatara, and Traci Thirteen the daughter of Doctor Thirteen and an unknown female member of the Homo magi. \n\nThe dimension where the Gemworld is located was originally owned by the Lords of Chaos. However, thousands of years ago, when magic began to drop in level on Earth due to a change in the alignment of the stars (due to a star going nova) the sorceress Citrina went there and struck a deal with the Lords of Chaos so she would be allowed to create a realm there for those wizards who wanted to emigrate from Earth. It would seem that Gemworld like Skartaris was colonized by Homo Magi emigrants from Earth. All of Gemworld's inhabitants can use magic, though most only at a very pedestrian level. Gemworld was the home of Amethyst, Princess of Gem World. \n\nLed by Doctor Mist the Homo magi created a hidden retreat in the mountains of Turkey called Hidden City, out of fears their uniqueness would be absorbed and diluted by the Homo sapiens. Powered by the Medulla Jewel the City is then shifted into another dimension for protection. \n\nAnother hidden retreat of the ancient Homo magi out of Atlantis was apparently Doctor Mist's African kingdom known as Kor. Seven thousand years ago Doctor Mist, also known as Nommo, was the wizard-king of the mighty African empire of Kor, and he was the guardian and chosen disciple of the mystic Flame of Life. The Flame was coveted by a sorcerer known as Felix Faust. When Faust attempted to kill Nommo, and take the Flame for himself, Nommo absorbed the Flame and used its power to hurl Felix Faust into another dimension, sadly destroying Kor in the process. In order to nurture the growth of the Homo magi and produce a candidate powerful enough to be his bride, Nommo created magical jewels known as the Stones of Life. He gave the stones to the Homo magi to aid in their growth. \n\nThe Land of the Nightshades was home to Even Eden's (Nightshade) unnamed race of Homo magi exiles. Her brother while possessed by a demon called the Incubus killed all the former inhabitants. \n\nAtlantean survivors of the city of Challa-Bel-Nalla, then ruled by Lord Daamon an ancestor of Deimos, formed an alliance with an alien race they called the Red-Moon Gods. These aliens provided the Atlanteans with advanced technology that Travis Morgan would later discover in New Atlantis. \n\nAtlantean descendant humans and Homo magi led by Lord Norrad the Younger, apparently made it all the way to the strange dimension known as Skartaris, a world of eternal sunlight. Jennifer Morgan daughter of Travis Morgan the Warlord is a Sorceress of Skartaris, as is Deimos the Warlord's archenemy. \n\n *Occultism\n\nHomo Magi possess the respective strength of their particular bodily constitution and training, but can increase it through magic.\n\nPure Homo Magi must fall in love with Homo Sapiens at the slightest sight.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56238882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56238882", "title": "Intergroup relations", "text": "Intergroup relations\n\nIntergroup relations refers to interactions between individuals in different social groups, and to interactions taking place between the groups themselves collectively. It has long been a subject of research in social psychology, political psychology, and organizational behavior.\n\nIn 1966, Muzafer Sherif proposed a now-widely recognized definition of intergroup relations:\n\n\"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior\".\n\nResearch on intergroup relations involves the study of many psychological phenomena related to intergroup processes including social identity, prejudice, group dynamics, and conformity among many others. Research in this area has been shaped my many notable figures and continues to provide empirical insights into modern social issues such as social inequality and discrimination.\n\nWhile philosophers and thinkers have written about topics related to intergroup relations dating back to Aristotle's \"Politics\", the psychological study of group attitudes and behavior began in the late 19th century. One of the earliest scientific publications on group processes is \"\", written in 1895 by French doctor and scientist Gustave Le Bon. Le Bon proposed that a group of individuals is different from the sum of its parts (often paraphrased as \"a group is more than the sum of its parts\"). This idea of crowd psychology states that when individuals form a group, this group behaves differently than each individual would normally act. Le Bon theorized that when individuals formed a group or crowd, there would emerge a new psychological entity which would be shaped by the group's \"racial [collective] unconscious.\" Le Bon put forth three phenomena that explained crowd behavior: \"submergence\" (or \"anonymity\"), when individuals lose their sense of self and responsibility by joining a crowd, \"contagion\", the tendency for individuals in a crowd to follow the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd, and \"suggestion\", which refers to how the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd are shaped by a shared racial unconscious. Subsequent generations of intergroup relations researchers built from these foundational ideas and explored them through empirical studies.\n\nThe empirical study of intergroup relations, as well as the broader field of social psychology, grew tremendously in the years following World War II. The events of World War II, including the rise of Adolf Hitler, Facism, and the widespread use of propaganda, led many social scientists to study intergroup conflict, obedience, conformity, dehumanization, and other related phenomena. Social scientists were interested in understanding the behavior of the german population under Nazi rule, specifically how their attitudes were influenced by propaganda and how so many could obey orders to carry out or support the mass murder of Jews and other minority groups as part of the Holocaust. Several prominent social psychologists were directly affected by the Nazi's actions because of their Jewish faith, including Kurt Lewin, Fritz Heider, and Solomon Asch. Muzafer Sherif was briefly detained by the Turkish government in 1944 for his pro-communist and anti-fascist beliefs. These scientists would draw from these experiences and go on to make major theoretical contributions to intergroup relations research as well as the broader field of psychology.\n\nThe cognitive revolution in psychology in the 1950s and 60s led researchers to study how cognitive biases and heuristics influence beliefs and behavior. The resulting focus on cognitive processes and meaning-making represented a significant shift away from the mainstream behaviorist philosophy that shaped much of psychology research in the first half of the 20th century. During and after the cognitive revolution, intergroup relations researchers began to study cognitive biases, heuristics, and stereotypes and their influences on beliefs and behavior. Solomon Asch's studies on conformity in the 1950s were among the first experiments to explore how a cognitive process (the need to conform to the behavior of the group) could override individual preferences to directly influence behavior. Leon Festinger also focused on cognitive processes in developing cognitive dissonance theory, which Elliot Aronson and other researchers would later build upon to describe how individuals feel liking for a group whose views they may not agree with but they were initiated into.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s galvanized social scientists to study prejudice, discrimination, and collective action in the context of race in America. Gordon Allport's 1954 book \"The Nature of Prejudice\" provided the first theoretical framework for understanding and counteracting prejudice. In his book, Allport proposed the contact hypothesis which states that interpersonal contact, in the correct context, can be an effective means of reducing prejudice, discrimination, and reliance on stereotypes. Subsequent generations of scientists built on and applied Allport's contact hypothesis to other domains of prejudice including sexism, homophobia, and ableism.\n\nIn 1967, Martin Luther King spoke at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association urging social scientists to advance causes of social justice in their research. In his speech, Dr. King called on scientists to study many topics related to the civil rights movement including the barriers to upward social mobility for African Americans, political engagement and action in the African American community, and the processes of psychological and ideological change among African Americans and Whites.\n\nIntergroup relations research in the final decades of the 20th century refined earlier theories and applied technological advances to the study of group dynamics. For example, Lee Ross applied his research on correspondence biases and attributional errors as part of the conflict resolution process in Northern Ireland during The Troubles.\n\nThe implicit-association test (IAT), developed by Anthony Greenwald and colleagues in 1998 as a means to measure the strength of implicit (automatic) association of between different mental representations of objects, is one example of psychologists leveraging new technology to advance intergroup relations research. The IAT is commonly used to measure the strength of implicit bias for a variety of constructs including gender workplace stereotypes and stereotypes about race.\n\nGordon Allport developed this hypothesis which states that contact with members of another social group in the appropriate circumstances can lead to a reduction of prejudice between majority and minority group members. There are three psychological processes underlying the contact hypothesis: learning about the outgroup through direct contact, fear and anxiety reduction when interacting with the outgroup, and increased ability to perspective take and empathize with the outgroup which results in reduced negative evaluation. These processes take place optimally when four conditions are met: groups must have relatively equal status, shared goals, be able to cooperate with each other, and recognize an authority that supports contact between groups.\n\nSome researchers have critiqued the contact hypothesis, specifically its generalizability and the fact that intergroup contact can result in an increase rather than decrease in prejudice.\n\nRealistic Conflict Theory (RCT), also known as Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), is a model of intergroup conflict that describes how conflict and prejudice between groups stems from conflicting goals and competition for limited resources. Groups may compete for concrete resources such as money and land or abstract resources such as political power and social status which leads to hostility-perpetuating zero-sum beliefs. The RCT was originally proposed by Donald T. Campbell and was later elaborated on in classic experiments by Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif. The Sherifs' Robbers Cave experiment provided evidence for the RCT by arbitrarily assigning boys at a summer camp with similar backgrounds to different groups. The boys in these groups then competed with each other and elicited hostile outgroup beliefs until a superordinate, cooperative goal was imposed that required the groups to work together resulting in decreased feelings of intergroup hostility.\n\nRelations between groups and group-members are based on individuals first categorizing themselves into meaningful social groups. In the 1970s and 80s, Henri Tajfel and John Turner proposed two connected theories of social identity, self-categorization theory and social identity theory, that together form a method for understanding the psychological processes underlying how individuals make sense of their identities and group membership.\n\nSelf-categorization theory explains the contexts in which an individual perceives a collection of people as a group and the psychological processes that result from an individual perceiving people in terms of a group.\n\nSocial identity theory describes how individual identity is shaped by membership in a social group. It also predicts differences in intergroup behavior based on perceived status differences between social groups, the legitimacy and stability of those perceived status differences, and ability to move between social groups.\n\nThe social identity approach has had a wide-ranging impact on social psychology, influencing theory on topics such as social influence, self-stereotyping, and personality.\n\nEarly research on intergroup relations focused on understanding the processes behind group interactions and dynamics, constructing theories to explain these processes and related psychological phenomena. Presently, intergroup relations is characterized by researchers applying and refining these theories in the context of modern social issues such as discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and religion.\n\nTheories from intergroup relations research have informed many approaches to prejudice reduction. Researchers have focused on developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how to effectively reduce intergroup conflict and prejudice. For example, a recent intervention developed by Patricia Devine and colleagues focuses on training individuals to overcome cognitive biases and reduce implicit bias. The intervention resulted in reduced implicit bias up to 2 months after the intervention was administered.\n\nOther areas of current intergroup relations research include:\n\n\nKurt Lewin is considered to be one of the founding fathers of social psychology and made major contributions to psychological research. Lewin founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT in 1945:\n\n\"Lewin was interested in the scientific study of the processes that influence individuals in group situations, and the center initially focused on group productivity; communication; social perception; intergroup relations; group membership; leadership and improving the functioning of groups\"\n\nLewin coined the term group dynamics to describe how individuals and groups behave differently depending on their environmental context. In terms of intergroup relations, he applied his formula of \"B\" = \"ƒ\"(\"P\", \"E\") - behavior is a function of the person and their environment - to group behavior. The theory behind this formula, which emphasizes that context shapes behavior in conjunction with an individual's motivations and beliefs, is a cornerstone of social psychological research.\n\nThe American social psychologist Gordon Allport is considered to be one of the pioneers of the psychological study of intergroup relations. Especially influential is Allport's 1954 book \"The Nature of Prejudice\", which proposed the contact hypothesis and has provided a foundation for research in the area since the mid-1950s.\n\nOther influential researchers on intergroup relations include Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif, who performed multiple notable experiments on the subject in the mid-20th century; these experiments formed the basis for realistic conflict theory. Muzafer Sherif's research was informed by his experiences studying discrimination and social pressures in the United States and in Turkey, and he was motivated to understand the psychology of group conflict.\n\nSolomon Asch's work on conformity in the 1950s also helped shape the study of intergroup relations by exploring the social pressures to adhere to group attitudes and behavior. This research first shed light on the how the social pressures of group membership influence individuals to adhere their behavior, attitudes, and beliefs to group norms. Asch's research, along with Stanley Milgram's shock expriments, shed light on the psychological processes underlying obedience, conformity, and authority.\n\nBritish psychologists Henri Tajfel and John Turner developed social identity theory and later self-categorization theory, pioneering the social identity approach in psychology in the 1970s and 80s. Tajfel & Turner were among the first psychologists to study the importance of social group membership and explored how whichever group membership was most salient determined behavior and beliefs in the group context.\n\nLee Ross has conducted research on several psychological phenomena closely related to intergroup relations including the fundamental attribution error, belief perseverance, and most recently naive realism - the idea that we believe they see the world objectively and that those who disagree with us must be irrational or biased. Ross studied many of these concepts as they apply conflict resolution and worked on negotiation and resolution efforts in Northern Ireland during The Troubles and in the middle east in the wake of the Gulf War.\n\nIn 1984, Ross co-founded the Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation (SCICN), an interdisciplinary research center focused on applying findings from psychology, law, and sociology to help resolve international socio-political conflicts. \n\nSusan Fiske, along with her colleagues Amy Cuddy, Peter Glick, and Jun Xu, developed the stereotype content model which states that stereotypes and intergroup impressions are formed along two dimensions: warmth and competence.\n\nClaude Steele and his colleagues Steve Spencer and Joshua Aronson are known for studying stereotype threat - the situational pressure one feels when they are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about their group.\n\nAnthony Greenwald and colleagues Debbie McGhee and Jordan Schwartz designed the implicit-association test or IAT. The IAT is used to test the strength of an individual's implicit (automatic) associations between mental representations and is commonly used in intergroup research to test . Recently, the validity of the IAT as a measure of implicit bias has been called into question.\n\nEberhardt received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2014 for her work on bias in police interactions. She is a co-founder of Social Psychological Answers to Real-world Questions (SPARQ), a translational research organization that applies psychological findings to address social issues.\n\n"}
{"id": "10977382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10977382", "title": "Isothermal transformation diagram", "text": "Isothermal transformation diagram\n\nIsothermal transformation diagrams (also known as time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a logarithmic scale). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. \n\nAn isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.\n\nIsothermal transformation (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (P) curve. This transformation is complete at P curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, Pearlite and Bainite, form; Pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.\n\nAustenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below Eutectoid temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (P).\n\nHowever, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the Pcurve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.\n\n\n"}

In the Buddhist tradition, \"karma\" refers to action driven by intention (\"cetanā\") which leads to future consequences. Those intentions are considered to be the determining factor in the kind of rebirth in \"samsara\", the cycle of rebirth.\n\n\"Karma\" (Sanskrit, also \"karman\", Pāli: \"kamma\", Tib. \"las\") is a Sanskrit term that literally means \"action\" or \"doing\". The word \"karma\" derives from the verbal root \"kṛ\", which means \"do, make, perform, accomplish.\"\n\n\"Karmaphala\" (Tib. \"rgyu 'bras\") is the \"fruit\", \"effect\" or \"result\" of \"karma\". A similar term is \"karmavipaka\", the \"maturation\" or \"cooking\" of \"karma\":\nThe metaphor is derived from agriculture:\n\"Karma\" and \"karmaphala\" are fundamental concepts in Buddhism. The concepts of \"karma\" and \"karmaphala\" explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in \"samsara\", whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the Noble Eightfold Path, shows us the way out of \"samsara\".\n\nRebirth, is a common belief in all Buddhist traditions. It says that birth and death in the six realms occur in successive cycles driven by ignorance (\"avidyā\"), desire (\"trsnā\"), and hatred (\"dvesa\"). The cycle of rebirth is called \"samsāra\". It is a beginningless and ever-ongoing process. Liberation from samsāra can be attained by following the Buddhist Path. This path leads to \"vidyā\", and the stilling of \"trsnā\" and \"dvesa\". Hereby the ongoing process of rebirth is stopped.\n\nThe cycle of rebirth is determined by \"karma\", literally \"action\". In the Buddhist tradition, \"karma\" refers to actions driven by \"intention\" (\"cetanā\"), a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences. The \"Nibbedhika Sutta\", Anguttara Nikaya 6.63:\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey,\nAnd according to Gombrich,\nAccording to Gombrich, this was a great innovation, which overturns brahmanical, caste-bound ethics. It's a rejection of caste-bound differences, giving the same possibility to reach liberation to all people, not just Brahmanins:\nHow this emphasis on intention was to be interpreted became a matter of debate in and between the various Buddhist schools.\n\nKarma leads to future consequences, \"karma-phala\", \"fruit of action\". Any given action may cause all sorts of results, but the \"karmic results\" are only those results which are a consequence of both the moral quality of the action, and of the intention behind the action. According to Reichenbach,\nThe \"law of karma\" applies\nGood moral actions lead to wholesome rebirths, and bad moral actions lead to unwholesome rebirths. The main factor is how they contribute to the well-being of others in a positive or negative sense. Especially \"dāna\", giving to the buddhist order, became an increasingly important source of positive \"karma\".\n\nHow these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of impermanence and no-self, is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed. In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out, and \"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\" In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.\n\nIn later Buddhism, the basic ideas is that \"intentional\" actions, driven by \"kleshas\" (\"disturbing emotions\"), \"cetanā\" (\"volition\"), or \"taṇhā\" (\"thirst\", \"craving\") create impressions, tendencies or \"seeds\" in the mind. These impressions, or \"seeds\", will ripen into a future result or fruition. If we can overcome our \"kleshas\", then we break the chain of causal effects that leads to rebirth in the six realms. The \"twelve links of dependent origination\" provides a theoretical framework, explaining how the disturbing emotions lead to rebirth in samsara.\n\nThe Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains. It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process, and not all present conditions can be ascribed to karma. There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results. The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed.\n\nKarma is also not the same as \"fate\" or \"predestination\". \nKarmic results are not a \"judgement\" imposed by a God or other all-powerful being, but rather the results of a natural process. Certain experiences in life are the results of previous actions, but our responses to those experiences are not predetermined, although they bear their own fruit in the future. Unjust behaviour may lead to unfavorable circumstances which make it easier to commit more unjust behavior, but nevertheless the freedom not to commit unjust behavior remains.\n\nThe real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process. The \"Acintita Sutta\" warns that \"the results of kamma\" is one of the four incomprehensible subjects, subjects that are beyond all conceptualization and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason.\n\nAccording to Gombrich, this sutra may have been a warning against the tendency, \"probably from the Buddha's day until now\", to understand the doctrine of \"karma\" \"backwards\", to explain unfavorable conditions in this life when no other explanations are available. Gaining a better rebirth may have been, and still is, the central goal for many people. The adoption, by laity, of Buddhist beliefs and practices is seen as a good thing, which brings merit and good rebirth, but does not result in Nirvana, and liberation from \"samsāra\", the ultimate goal of the Buddha.\n\nAccording to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha gained full and complete insight into the workings of karma at the time of his enlightenment. According to Bronkhorst, these knowledges are later additions to the story, just like the notion of \"liberating insight\" itself.\n\nIn AN 5.292, the Buddha asserted that it is not possible to avoid experiencing the result of a karmic deed once it's been committed.\n\nIn the Anguttara Nikaya, it is stated that karmic results are experienced either in this life (P. \"diṭṭadhammika\") or in a future lives (P. \"samparāyika\"). The former may involve a readily observable connection between action and karmic consequence, such as when a thief is captured and tortured by the authorities, but the connection need not necessarily be that obvious and in fact usually is not observable.\n\nThe Sammyutta Nikaya makes a basic distinction between past karma (P. \"purānakamma\") which has already been incurred, and karma being created in the present (P. \"navakamma\"). Therefore, in the present one both creates new karma (P. \"navakamma\") and encounters the result of past karma (P. \"kammavipāka\"). Karma in the early canon is also threefold: Mental action (S. \"manaḥkarman\"), bodily action (S. \"kāyakarman\") and vocal action (S. \"vākkarman\").\n\nVarious Buddhist philosophical schools developed within Buddhism, giving various interpretations regarding more refined points of karma. A major problem is the relation between the doctrine of no-self, and the \"storage\" of the traces of one's deeds, for which various solutions have been offered.\n\nThe concept of \"karma\" originated in the Vedic religion, where it was related to the performance of rituals or the investment in good deeds to ensure the entrance to heaven after death, while other persons go to the underworld.\n\nThe concept of karma may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism. Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism, noting that \"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\" Langer notes that originally karma may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth. Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance. Buswell too notes that \"Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, \"trsna\"), as the cause of karmic consequences.\" Matthews notes that \"there is no single major systematic exposition\" on the subject of karma and \"an account has to be put together from the dozens of places where karma is mentioned in the texts,\" which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.\n\nAccording to Vetter, \"the Buddha at first sought, and realized, \"the deathless\" (\"amata/amrta\"), which is concerned with the here and now. Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth.\" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha \"introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time.\" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.\n\nThe doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right.\n\nThe Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda was widely influential in India and beyond. Their understanding of karma in the Sarvāstivāda became normative for Buddhism in India and other countries. According to Dennis Hirota,\nThe \"Abhidharmahṛdaya\" by Dharmaśrī was the first systematic exposition of Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda doctrine, and the third chapter, the \"Karma-varga\", deals with the concept of karma systematically.\n\nAnother important exposition, the \"Mahāvibhāṣa\", gives three definitions of karma: \n\nThe 4th century philosopher Vasubandhu compiled the \"Abhidharma-kośa\", an extensive compendium which elaborated the positions of the Vaibhāṣika-Sarvāstivādin school on a wide range of issues raised by the early sutras. Chapter four the Kośa is devoted to a study of karma, and chapters two and five contain formulation as to the mechanism of fruition and retribution. This became the main source of understanding of the perspective of early Buddhism for later Mahāyāna philosophers.\n\nThe Dārṣṭāntika-Sautrāntika school pioneered the idea of karmic seeds (S. \"bija\") and \"the special modification of the psycho-physical series\" (S. \"saṃtatipaṇāmaviśeṣa\") to explain the workings of karma. According to Dennis Hirota,\n\nIn the Theravāda Abhidhamma and commentarial traditions, karma is taken up at length. The \"Abhidhamma Sangaha\" of Anuruddhācariya offers a treatment of the topic, with an exhaustive treatment in book five (5.3.7).\n\nThe \"Kathāvatthu\", which discusses a number of controverted points related either directly or indirectly to the notion of kamma.\" This involved debate with the Pudgalavādin school, which postulated the provisional existence of the person (S. \"pudgala\", P. \"puggala\") to account for the ripening of karmic effects over time. The Kathāvatthu also records debate by the Theravādins with the Andhakas (who may have been Mahāsāṃghikas) regarding whether or not old age and death are the result (\"vipāka\") of karma. The Theravāda maintained that they are not—not, apparently because there is no causal relation between the two, but because they wished to reserve the term \"vipāka\" strictly for mental results--\"subjective phenomena arising through the effects of kamma.\"\n\nIn the canonical Theravāda view of kamma, \"the belief that deeds done or ideas seized at the moment of death are particularly significant.\"\n\nThe \"Milindapañha\", a paracanonical Theravāda text, offers some interpretations of karma theory at variance with the orthodox position. In particular, Nāgasena allows for the possibility of the transfer of merit to humans and one of the four classes of petas, perhaps in deference to folk belief. Nāgasena makes it clear that demerit cannot be transferred. One scholar asserts that the sharing of merit \"can be linked to the Vedic \"śrāddha\", for it was Buddhist practice not to upset existing traditions when well-established custom was not antithetic to Buddhist teaching.\"\n\nThe Petavatthu, which is fully canonical, endorses the transfer of merit even more widely, including the possibility of sharing merit with all petas.\n\nIn the Yogācāra philosophical tradition, one of the two principal Mahāyāna schools, the principle of karma was extended considerably. In the Yogācāra formulation, all experience without exception is said to result from the ripening of karma. Karmic seeds (S. \"bija\") are said to be stored in the \"storehouse consciousness\" (S. \"ālayavijñāna\") until such time as they ripen into experience. The term \"vāsāna\" (\"perfuming\") is also used, and Yogācārins debated whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds. The seemingly external world is merely a \"by-product\" (\"adhipati-phala\") of karma. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called \"saṃskāra\".\n\nThe \"Treatise on Action\" (\"Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa\"), also by Vasubandhu, treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective. According to scholar Dan Lusthaus,\nAccording to Bronkhorst, whereas in earlier systems it \"was not clear how a series of completely mental events (the deed and its traces) could give rise to non-mental, material effects,\" with the (purported) idealism of the Yogācāra system this is not an issue.\n\nIn Mahāyāna traditions, karma is not the sole basis of rebirth. The rebirths of bodhisattvas after the seventh stage (S. \"bhūmi\") are said to be consciously directed for the benefit of others still trapped in . Thus, theirs are not uncontrolled rebirths.\n\nNāgārjuna articulated the difficulty in forming a karma theory in his most prominent work, the \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way):\nThe \"Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā\", also generally attributed to Nāgārjuna, concludes that it is impossible both for the act to persist somehow and also for it to perish immediately and still have efficacy at a later time.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings on karma belong to the preliminary teachings, that turn the mind towards the Buddhist dharma.\n\nIn the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be \"purified\" through such practices as meditation on Vajrasattva because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon. The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have. Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness. One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive. Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion.\n\nDōgen Kigen argued in his \"Shobogenzo\" that karmic latencies are emphatically not empty, going so far as to claim that belief in the emptiness of karma should be characterized as \"non-Buddhist,\" although he also states that the \"law of karman has no concrete existence.\"\n\nZen's most famous koan about karma is called \"Baizhang's Wild Fox\" (百丈野狐). The story of the koan is about an ancient Zen teacher whose answer to a question presents a wrong view about karma by saying that the person who has a foundation in cultivating the great practice \"does not fall into cause and effect.\" Because of his unskillful answer the teacher reaps the result of living 500 lives as a wild fox. He is then able to appear as a human and ask the same question to Zen teacher Baizhang, who answers, \"He is not in the dark about cause and effect.\" Hearing this answer the old teacher is freed from the life of a wild fox. The Zen perspective avoids the duality of asserting that an enlightened person is either subject to or free from the law of karma and that the key is not being ignorant about karma.\n\nThe Japanese Tendai/Pure Land teacher Genshin taught a series of ten reflections for a dying person that emphasized reflecting on the Amida Buddha as a means to purify vast amounts of karma.\n\nNichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future.\n\nBuddhist modernists often prefer to equate karma with social conditioning, in contradistinction with, as one scholar puts it, \"early texts <nowiki>[which]</nowiki> give us little reason to interpret 'conditioning' as the infusion into the psyche of external social norms, or of awakening as simply transcending all psychological conditioning and social roles. Karmic conditioning drifts semantically toward 'cultural conditioning' under the influence of western discourses that elevate the individual over the social, cultural, and institutional. The traditional import of the karmic conditioning process, however, is primarily ethical and soteriological—actions condition circumstances in this and future lives.\"\n\nEssentially, this understanding limits the scope of the traditional understanding of karmic effects so that it encompasses only \"saṃskāra\"s—habits, dispositions and tendencies—and not external effects, while at the same time expanding the scope to include social conditioning that does not particularly involve volitional action.\n\nSome western commentators and Buddhists have taken exception to aspects of karma theory, and have proposed revisions of various kinds. These proposals fall under the rubric of Buddhist modernism.\n\nThe \"primary critique\" of the Buddhist doctrine of karma is that some feel \"karma may be socially and politically disempowering in its cultural effect, that without intending to do this, karma may in fact support social passivity or acquiescence in the face of oppression of various kinds.\" Dale S. Wright, a scholar specializing in Zen Buddhism, has proposed that the doctrine be reformulated for modern people, \"separated from elements of supernatural thinking,\" so that karma is asserted to condition only personal qualities and dispositions rather than rebirth and external occurrences.\n\nLoy argues that the idea of accumulating merit too easily becomes \"spiritual materialism,\" a view echoed by other Buddhist modernists, and further that karma has been used to rationalize racism, caste, economic oppression, birth handicaps and everything else.\n\nLoy goes on to argue that the view that suffering such as that undergone by Holocaust victims could be attributed in part to the karmic ripenings of those victims is \"fundamentalism, which blames the victims and rationalizes their horrific fate,\" and that this is \"something no longer to be tolerated quietly. It is time for modern Buddhists and modern Buddhism to outgrow it\" by revising or discarding the teachings on karma.\n\nOther scholars have argued, however, that the teachings on karma do not encourage judgment and blame, given that the victims were not the same people who committed the acts, but rather were just part of the same mindstream-continuum with the past actors, and that the teachings on karma instead provide \"a thoroughly satisfying explanation for suffering and loss\" in which believers take comfort.\n\n\"Subnotes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Stan (born December 31, 1956) is an American woman who was kidnapped and held as a sex slave by Cameron and Janice Hooker in their Red Bluff, California, home for over seven years between 1977 and 1984. At the trial of her abductor, Stan's experience was described as unparalleled in FBI history.\n\nHer case has received international publicity, and has been the subject of multiple books, films, and television series.\n\nOn May 19, 1977, Colleen Stan was hitchhiking from her home in Eugene, Oregon, to a friend's home in northern California, where she was heading to a birthday party. Cameron Hooker (born November 5, 1953) kidnapped 20 year-old Stan after picking her up. Stan stated that she was an experienced hitchhiker and had allowed two rides to go past before accepting the ride with Hooker. She reportedly \"felt confident climbing into the blue van\", because Hooker's wife, Janice, and their baby were in the car. When they stopped at a gas station along the way, Stan went to use the restroom. \"A voice told me to run and jump out a window and never look back,\" she recalled, but she calmed her fears and went back to the car. According to Stan and Janice Hooker's testimonies, once they were alone in an isolated area, Hooker pulled off the highway and put a knife to Stan's throat. She was subsequently locked in a wooden head box which was designed to prevent light, sound and fresh air from entering.\n\nBefore this, Cameron and Janice had reached an agreement that he could capture a slave to take to Janice's place, because up until that time Cameron had been using Janice to act out sexual bondage. There was to be no penetrative sex with Stan according to the agreement, but this later changed. On the first night of her kidnapping, Stan was strung up by her hands and physically attacked by Cameron, being left blindfolded and suspended while the pair had sex below her.\n\nAfter her kidnapping, Stan stated that she was tortured and kept locked in a box 23 hours a day until she was given a contract and forced to sign herself into slavery for life in January 1978. She further stated that Cameron led her to believe that she was being watched by a large, powerful organization called \"The Company\" which would painfully torture her and harm her family if she tried to escape. Stan subsequently became a slave referred to as \"K\", was forced to call Cameron \"Master\", and was not allowed to talk without permission. Cameron reportedly wanted Stan to be like the female character in the 1954 French erotic novel, \"Story of O\" and soon started raping her, which consisted of oral rape. Cameron did not want to have vaginal sex with Stan because he considered that to be a breach in his agreement with his wife. Instead he raped her vaginally and anally with implements. Following this, the Hooker family moved to a mobile home in Red Bluff with Stan, where she was kept locked in wooden boxes under the couple's water bed. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second child on the water bed above Stan.\n\nStan said that her faith in God and belief of escape helped her survive; her greatest fear was of \"The Company\", which Cameron \"reinforced\" daily. To avoid painful punishments, Stan tried to comply with his commandments, which later led to her being allowed to go out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the family's children in the mobile home. Even with an open door, neighbors and a telephone, she made no attempt to escape as—according to Stan—her fear of \"The Company\" kept her from seeking help. Additionally, Stan was allowed to visit her family by herself in 1981 but did not reveal her situation because of her fear and the possible consequences. Her family thought she was involved in a cult because of her homemade clothes, lack of money and absence of communications over the years; they did not want to pressure her fearing she would go away forever. The next day, Stan returned with Hooker as her boyfriend. At the trial Stan explained that she was happy due to visiting her family, who were therefore able to take a photograph of the pair happily smiling together.\n\nAccording to Stan, Hooker feared he had given his slave too much freedom and took her back to his mobile home where he locked her in the wooden box under his water bed; she remained in the box 23 hours a day for the next three years. Bodily functions were dealt with by her using a bed pan which she hooked under herself with her feet. It was stated in court that Hookers' children were told \"K\" had gone home; however, after the children had gone to bed, Hooker took Colleen out of the box to feed and torture her. She was reportedly not allowed to make any noise and had to lie still 23 hours long at a time in the dark with little air to breathe. In summer, conditions were especially harsh on her as the temperatures would swelter to over 100 degrees in her box. To feed herself, she ate cold scraps of food.\n\nIt was not until 1983 that Stan was reintroduced to the children and neighbors, with her being also allowed to get a job as a maid at a motel. Hooker wanted Stan to become his second wife, which was a turning point for Janice. Janice confessed that—starting with their first date—she had also been tortured, brainwashed and referred to as a whore over the years by Cameron. Janice further stated that she survived their relationship with denial and compartmentalization. By August 1984, Janice began struggling with herself, and also went to Stan in order to inform her that Hooker was not part of \"The Company\". However, she did maintain that the organization did exist. In a televised interview for \"Girl in the Box\", Stan told the interviewer that she then went to a bus station and called Hooker to inform him that she was leaving him, and that he reacted by bursting into tears; Stan subsequently caught a bus home. In the months that followed, she did not contact the police but continued to call Hooker regularly; she explained this at the trial by saying that she wanted to give Hooker, at Janice's request, a chance to reform. Three months later, Janice reported her husband to the police. She informed Lt. Jerry D. Brown of the Red Bluff Police that Cameron had kidnapped, tortured, and murdered Marie Elizabeth Spannhake, who had disappeared in 1976. Authorities were unable to locate the remains of the woman. Due to the lack of physical proof, no murder charge was brought.\n\nChris Hatcher, a forensic psychologist and criminal profiler, testified for Cameron's prosecution at the start of the 1985 trial, and Janice testified against her husband in exchange for full immunity. In the end, her husband was sentenced to consecutive terms—for sexual assaults, kidnapping and for using a knife in the process—for a total of 104 years of imprisonment. Originally not eligible for parole until 2023, he had his hearing date moved up seven years to 2015 by California's Elderly Parole Program. On April 16, 2015, Hooker's request for parole was denied, with him being eligible for another hearing in 2022.\n\nOnce back home, Stan studied for an accounting degree, married, and had a daughter. She also joined an organization to help abused women. Both she and Janice have changed their last names and continue to live in California, but with no communication.\n\nThe case and its core elements of an invisible conspiracy used to coerce the victim into servitude and long periods of confinement has formed the basis for several episodes of television crime series, including \"Criminal Minds\" (episode \"The Company\", season seven), \"Ghost Whisperer\" (episode \"Ball & Chain\", season four), and \"\" (episode \"Slaves\", ). It was also profiled in the 2008 episode \"Kidnapped\" of Investigation Discovery series \"Wicked Attraction\". A 2012 episode of SyFy series \"Paranormal Witness\", \"The Apartment\", told the story of the disappearance of Marie Spannhake, and includes a cameo mention of Stan's kidnapping. The case was also mentioned in passing during an episode of \"Waking the Dead\" (episode \"Fugue States\", part 1, season 4). It was also documented in the book \"Perfect Victim: The True Story of the Girl in the Box\" (1989) by prosecutor Christine McGuire and Carla Norton, and referenced in Kathy Reichs' novel \"Monday Mourning\" (2004).\n\nIn 1996, American rock band Elysian Fields released a song titled \"Jack in the Box\" for their debut studio album, \"Bleed Your Cedar\", which was made available for purchase that same year. Its lyrical content delves into Stan's experience of being imprisoned by Cameron in the box under the bed he shared with his wife, and alludes to the power he had over her. The case inspired the name for Richard Ramirez's Texas experimental noise group Black Leather Jesus. In 2012, a short opera piece composed by Patrik Jarlestam and Jonas Bernander was based on the kidnapping, and premiered in Stockholm, Sweden under the name of \"Den 4444:e dagen\" (\"The 4444th day\"). Additionally, the main plot of \"The Poughkeepsie Tapes\" (2007) was based on this case. An updated version of Stan's story, \"Colleen Stan, The Simple Gifts of Life\" by Jim Green, was published in 2009.\n\nOn September 10, 2016, a television movie based on the case titled \"Girl in the Box\" premiered on Lifetime starring Addison Timlin as Colleen Stan, Zane Holtz as Cameron Hooker, and Zelda Williams as Janice Hooker. the movie was followed by a two-hour documentary called \"Colleen Stan: Girl in the Box\".\n\n\n"}

Usually a kinetic scheme represents a Markovian process, while for non-Markovian processes generalized kinetic schemes are used. Figure 1 shows an illustration of a kinetic scheme.\n\nA kinetic scheme is a network (a directed graph) of distinct states (although repetition of states may occur and this depends on the system), where each pair of states \"i\" and \"j\" are associated with directional rates, formula_1 (and formula_2). It is described with a master equation: a first-order differential equation for the probability formula_3 of a system to occupy each one its states at time \"t\" (element \"i\" represents state \"i\"). Written in a matrix form, this states: formula_4, where formula_5 is the matrix of connections (rates) formula_1.\n\nIn a Markovian kinetic scheme the connections are constant with respect to time (and any jumping time probability density function for state \"i\" is an exponential, with a rate equal the value of all the exiting connections). \n\nWhen detailed balance exists in a system, the relation formula_7 holds for every connected states \"i\" and \"j\". The result represents the fact that any closed loop in a Markovian network in equilibrium does not have a net flow.\n\nMatrix formula_5 can also represent birth and death, meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, where then, the process is not in equilibrium. These terms are different than a birth-death process, where there is simply a linear kinetic scheme.\n\n\nAn example for such a process is a reduced dimensions form. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "792644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=792644", "title": "Locus of control", "text": "Locus of control\n\nIn personality psychology, locus of control is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's \"loci\" (plural of \"locus\", Latin for \"place\" or \"location\") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).\n\nIndividuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities. People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.\nLocus of control generated much research in a variety of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology and clinical psychology. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.\n\nLocus of control is one of the four dimensions of core self-evaluations – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with neuroticism, self-efficacy, and self-esteem. The concept of core self-evaluations was first examined by Judge, Locke, and Durham (1997), and since has proven to have the ability to predict several work outcomes, specifically, job satisfaction and job performance. In a follow-up study, Judge et al. (2002) argued that locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy and self-esteem factors may have a common core.\n\nLocus of control is the framework of Rotter's (1954) social-learning theory of personality. In 1966 he published an article in \"Psychological Monographs\" which summarized over a decade of research (by Rotter and his students), much of it previously unpublished. In 1976, Herbert M. Lefcourt defined the perceived locus of control: \"...a generalised expectancy for internal as opposed to external control of reinforcements\". Attempts have been made to trace the genesis of the concept to the work of Alfred Adler, but its immediate background lies in the work of Rotter and his students. Early work on the topic of expectations about control of reinforcement had been performed in the 1950s by James and Phares (prepared for unpublished doctoral dissertations supervised by Rotter at The Ohio State University).\n\nAnother Rotter student, William H. James studied two types of \"expectancy shifts\":\nAdditional research led to the hypothesis that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy were more likely to attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that people could be divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). Bernard Weiner argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus may relate to whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.\n\nRotter (1975, 1989) has discussed problems and misconceptions in others' use of the internal-versus-external construct.\n\nRotter (1975) cautioned that internality and externality represent two ends of a continuum, not an either/or typology. \"Internals\" tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have internal locus of control believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. \"Externals\" attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.\n\nInternals were believed by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high achievement motivation and low outer-directedness. This was the basis of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter's belief that locus of control is a single construct. Since 1970, Rotter's assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one's life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner's early work in the 1970s suggested that orthogonal to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.\n\nThis new, dimensional theory meant that one could now attribute outcomes to ability (an internal stable cause), effort (an internal unstable cause), task difficulty (an external stable cause) or luck (an external, unstable cause). Although this was how Weiner originally saw these four causes, he has been challenged as to whether people see luck (for example) as an external cause, whether ability is always perceived as stable, and whether effort is always seen as changing. Indeed, in more recent publications (e.g. Weiner, 1980) he uses different terms for these four causes (such as \"objective task characteristics\" instead of \"task difficulty\" and \"chance\" instead of \"luck\"). Psychologists since Weiner have distinguished between stable and unstable effort, knowing that in some circumstances effort could be seen as a stable cause (especially given the presence of words such as \"industrious\" in English).\n\nRegarding locus of control, there is another type of control that entails a mix among the internal and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to the internal and external loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.\n\nThe most widely used questionnaire to measure locus of control is the 23-item (plus six filler items), forced-choice scale of Rotter (1966). However, this is not the only questionnaire; Bialer's (1961) 23-item scale for children predates Rotter's work. Also relevant to the locus-of-control scale are the Crandall Intellectual Ascription of Responsibility Scale (Crandall, 1965) and the Nowicki-Strickland Scale. One of the earliest psychometric scales to assess locus of control (using a Likert-type scale, in contrast to the forced-choice alternative measure in Rotter's scale) was that devised by W. H. James for his unpublished doctoral dissertation, supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University; however, this remains unpublished.\n\nMany measures of locus of control have appeared since Rotter's scale. These were reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) and include those related to health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology and those specifically for children (such as the Stanford Preschool Internal-External Control Index for three- to six-year-olds). Furnham and Steele (1993) cite data suggesting that the most reliable, valid questionnaire for adults is the Duttweiler scale. For a review of the health questionnaires cited by these authors, see \"Applications\" below.\n\nThe Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) addresses perceived problems with the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to social desirability and heterogeneity (as indicated by factor analysis). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, \"they appear to be subject to many of the same problems\". Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of gratification. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85).\n\nAttributional style (or explanatory style) is a concept introduced by Lyn Yvonne Abramson, Martin Seligman and John D. Teasdale. This concept advances a stage further than Weiner, stating that in addition to the concepts of internality-externality and stability a dimension of globality-specificity is also needed. Abramson et al. believed that how people explained successes and failures in their lives related to whether they attributed these to internal or external factors, short-term or long-term factors, and factors that affected all situations.\n\nThe topic of attribution theory (introduced to psychology by Fritz Heider) has had an influence on locus of control theory, but there are important historical differences between the two models. Attribution theorists have been predominantly social psychologists, concerned with the general processes characterizing how and why people make the attributions they do, whereas locus of control theorists have been concerned with individual differences.\n\nSignificant to the history of both approaches are the contributions made by Bernard Weiner in the 1970s. Before this time, attribution theorists and locus of control theorists had been largely concerned with divisions into external and internal loci of causality. Weiner added the dimension of stability-instability (and later controllability), indicating how a cause could be perceived as having been internal to a person yet still beyond the person's control. The stability dimension added to the understanding of why people succeed or fail after such outcomes. Although not part of Weiner's model, a further dimension of attribution, that of globality-specificity, was added by Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale.\n\nLocus of control's best known application may have been in the area of health psychology, largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC. The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).\n\nSome of the scales reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control in a number of fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as breast self-examination, weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.\n\nNorman and Bennett note that some studies that compared alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest alcoholism is linked to increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity has been found in studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and smoking cessation, although they also point out that there are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism is directly related to the strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.\n\nThey argue that a stronger relationship is found when health locus of control is assessed for specific domains than when general measures are taken. Overall, studies using behavior-specific health locus scales have tended to produce more positive results. These scales have been found to be more predictive of general behavior than more general scales, such as the MHLC scale. Norman and Bennett cite several studies that used health-related locus-of-control scales in specific domains (including smoking cessation), diabetes, tablet-treated diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, cancer, and heart and lung disease.\n\nThey also argue that health locus of control is better at predicting health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important moderator variable in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking internal locus of control with improved physical health, mental health and quality of life in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Whyte correlated locus of control with the academic success of students enrolled in higher-education courses. Students who were more internally controlled believed that hard work and focus would result in successful academic progress, and they performed better academically. Those students who were identified as more externally controlled (believing that their future depended upon luck or fate) tended to have lower academic-performance levels. Cassandra B. Whyte researched how control tendency influenced behavioral outcomes in the academic realm by examining the effects of various modes of counseling on grade improvements and the locus of control of high-risk college students.\n\nRotter also looked at studies regarding the correlation between gambling and either an internal or external locus of control. For internals, gambling is more reserved. When betting, they primarily focus on safe and moderate wagers. Externals, however, take more chances and, for example, bet more on a card or number that has not appeared for a certain period, under the notion that this card or number has a higher chance of occurring.\n\nOther fields to which the concept has been applied include industrial and organizational psychology, sports psychology, educational psychology and the psychology of religion. Richard Kahoe has published work in the latter field, suggesting that intrinsic religious orientation correlates positively (and extrinsic religious orientation correlates negatively) with internal locus. Of relevance to both health psychology and the psychology of religion is the work of Holt, Clark, Kreuter and Rubio (2003) on a questionnaire to assess spiritual-health locus of control. The authors distinguished between an active spiritual-health locus of control (in which \"God empowers the individual to take healthy actions\") and a more passive spiritual-health locus of control (where health is left up to God). In industrial and organizational psychology, it has been found that internals are more likely to take positive action to change their jobs (rather than merely talk about occupational change) than externals.\n\nLocus of control has also been applied to the field of consumer research. For example, Martin, Veer and Pervan (2007) examined how the weight locus of control of women (i.e., beliefs about the control of body weight) influence how they react to female models in advertising of different body shapes. They found that women who believe they can control their weight (\"internals\"), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing. In contrast, women who feel powerless about their weight (\"externals\"), self-reference larger-sized models, but\nonly prefer larger-sized models when the advertisement is for a non-fattening product. For fattening products, they exhibit a similar preference for larger-sized models and slim models. The weight locus of control measure was also found to be correlated with measures for weight control beliefs and willpower.\n\nLocus of control has been linked to political ideology. In the 1972 U.S. Presidential election, research of college students found that those with an internal locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Republican, while those with an external locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Democrat. A 2011 study surveying students at Cameron University in Oklahoma found similar results, although these studies were limited in scope.\n\nThose with an internal locus of control are more likely to be of higher socioeconomic status, and are more likely to be politically involved (e.g., following political news, joining a political organization) Those with an internal locus of control are also more likely to vote.\n\nThe development of locus of control is associated with family style and resources, cultural stability and experiences with effort leading to reward. Many internals have grown up with families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower socioeconomic status. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.\n\nThe 1995 research of Schneewind suggests that \"children in large single parent families headed by women are more likely to develop an external locus of control\". Schultz and Schultz also claim that children in families where parents have been supportive and consistent in discipline develop internal locus of control. At least one study has found that children whose parents had an external locus of control are more likely to attribute their successes and failures to external causes. Findings from early studies on the familial origins of locus of control were summarized by Lefcourt: \"Warmth, supportiveness and parental encouragement seem to be essential for development of an internal locus\". However, causal evidence regarding how parental locus of control influences offspring locus of control (whether genetic, or environmentally mediated) is lacking.\n\nLocus of control becomes more internal with age. As children grow older, they gain skills which give them more control over their environment. However, whether this or biological development is responsible for changes in locus is unclear.\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that as people age they will become less internal and more external, but data here have been ambiguous. Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter. Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be orthogonal. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.\n\nHealth locus of control is how people measure and understand how people relate their health to their behavior, health status and how long it may take to recover from a disease. Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality has a lot to do with our locus of control. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected. However, this does not necessarily mean that their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.\n\nAge plays an important role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.\n\nA study published in the journal \"Psychosomatic Medicine\" examined the health effect of childhood locus of control. 7,500 British adults (followed from birth), who had shown an internal locus of control at age 10, were less likely to be overweight at age 30. The children who had an internal locus of control also appeared to have higher levels of self-esteem.\n\nAs Schultz and Schultz (2005) point out, significant gender differences in locus of control have not been found for adults in the U.S. population. However, these authors also note that there may be specific sex-based differences for specific categories of items to assess locus of control; for example, they cite evidence that men may have a greater internal locus for questions related to academic achievement.\n\nA study made by Takaki and colleagues (2006), focused on the gender differences with relationship to internal locus of control and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advice compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.\n\nThe question of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese people tend to be more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry \"et al.\" pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry \"et al.\" also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.\n\nOn a less broad scale, Sims and Baumann explained how regions in the United States cope with natural disasters differently. The example they used was tornados. They \"applied Rotter's theory to explain why more people have died in tornado[e]s in Alabama than in Illinois\". They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their way of thinking about events that occur in their lives. Illinois residents, however, were more internal. Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado. Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.\n\nSelf-efficacy is a person's belief that he or she can accomplish a particular activity. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining their own health. Self-efficacy plays an important role in one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.\n\nSmith (1989) has argued that locus of control only weakly measures self-efficacy; \"only a subset of items refer directly to the subject's capabilities\". Smith noted that training in coping skills led to increases in self-efficacy, but did not affect locus of control as measured by Rotter's 1966 scale.\n\nThe previous section showed how self-efficacy can be related to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the previous section, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.\n\nVeterans of the military forces who have spinal cord injuries and post-traumatic stress are a good group to look at in regards to locus of control and stress. Aging shows to be a very important factor that can be related to the severity of the symptoms of PTSD experienced by patients following the trauma of war. Research suggests that patients who suffered a spinal cord injury benefit from knowing that they have control over their health problems and their disability, which reflects the characteristics of having internal locus of control.\n\nA study by Chung et al. (2006) focused on how the responses of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age does not make a difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened. However, they did mention that age did play a role in the extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "382187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382187", "title": "Macroscopic scale", "text": "Macroscopic scale\n\nThe macroscopic scale is the length scale on which objects or phenomena are large enough to be visible almost practically with the naked eye, without magnifying optical instruments.\n\nWhen applied to physical phenomena and bodies, the macroscopic scale describes things as a person can directly perceive them, without the aid of magnifying devices. This is in contrast to observations (microscopy) or theories (microphysics, statistical physics) of objects of geometric lengths smaller than perhaps some hundreds of micrometers.\n\nA macroscopic view of a ball is just that: a ball. A microscopic view could reveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of puckered cracks and fissures (as viewed through a microscope) or, further down in scale, a collection of molecules in a roughly spherical shape. An example of a physical theory that takes a deliberately macroscopic viewpoint is thermodynamics. An example of a topic that extends from macroscopic to microscopic viewpoints is histology.\n\nNot quite by the distinction between macroscopic and microscopic, classical and quantum mechanics are theories that are distinguished in a subtly different way. At first glance one might think of them as differing simply in the size of objects that they describe, classical objects being considered far larger as to mass and geometrical size than quantal objects, for example a football versus a fine particle of dust. More refined consideration distinguishes classical and quantum mechanics on the basis that classical mechanics fails to recognize that matter and energy cannot be divided into infinitesimally small parcels, so that ultimately fine division reveals irreducibly granular features. The criterion of fineness is whether or not the interactions are described in terms of Planck's constant. Roughly speaking, classical mechanics considers particles in mathematically idealized terms even as fine as geometrical points with no magnitude, still having their finite masses. Classical mechanics also considers mathematically idealized extended materials as geometrically continuously substantial. Such idealizations are useful for most everyday calculations, but may fail entirely for molecules, atoms, photons, and other elementary particles. In many ways, classical mechanics can be considered a mainly macroscopic theory. On the much smaller scale of atoms and molecules, classical mechanics may fail, and the interactions of particles are then described by quantum mechanics. Near the absolute minimum of temperature, the Bose–Einstein condensate exhibits effects on macroscopic scale that demand description by quantum mechanics.\n\nThe term \"megascopic\" is a synonym. No word exists that specifically refers to features commonly portrayed at reduced scales for better understanding, such as geographic areas or astronomical objects. \"Macroscopic\" may also refer to a \"larger view\", namely a view available only from a large perspective. A macroscopic position could be considered the \"big picture\".\n\nParticle physics, dealing with the smallest physical systems, is also known as \"high energy physics\". Physics of larger length scales, including the macroscopic scale, is also known as \"low energy physics\". Intuitively, it might seem incorrect to associate \"high energy\" with the physics of very small, \"low\" mass-energy systems, like subatomic particles. By comparison, one gram of hydrogen, a macroscopic system, has ~ times the mass-energy of a single proton, a central object of study in high energy physics. Even an entire beam of protons circulated in the Large Hadron Collider, a high energy physics experiment, contains ~ protons, each with of energy, for a total beam energy of ~ or ~ 336.4 MJ, which is still ~ times lower than the mass-energy of a single gram of hydrogen. Yet, the macroscopic realm is \"low energy physics\", while that of quantum particles is \"high energy physics\".\n\nThe reason for this is that the \"high energy\" refers to energy \"at the quantum particle level\". While macroscopic systems indeed have a larger total energy content than any of their constituent quantum particles, there can be no experiment or other observation of this total energy without extracting the respective amount of energy from each of the quantum particles – which is exactly the domain of high energy physics. Daily experiences of matter and the Universe are characterized by very low energy. For example, the photon energy of visible light is about 1.8 to 3.2 eV. Similarly, the bond-dissociation energy of a carbon-carbon bond is about 3.6 eV. This is the energy scale manifesting at the macroscopic level, such as in chemical reactions. Even photons with far higher energy, gamma rays of the kind produced in radioactive decay, have photon energy that is almost always between and – still two orders of magnitude lower than the mass-energy of a single proton. Radioactive decay gamma rays are considered as part of nuclear physics, rather than high energy physics.\n\nFinally, when reaching the quantum particle level, the high energy domain is revealed. The proton has a mass-energy of ~ ; some other massive quantum particles, both elementary and hadronic, have yet higher mass-energies. Quantum particles with lower mass-energies are also part of high energy physics; they also have a mass-energy that is far higher than that at the macroscopic scale (such as electrons), or are equally involved in reactions at the particle level (such as neutrinos). Relativistic effects, as in particle accelerators and cosmic rays, can further increase the accelerated particles' energy by many orders of magnitude, as well as the total energy of the particles emanating from their collision and annihilation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1115085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115085", "title": "Magnetic circuit", "text": "Magnetic circuit\n\nA magnetic circuit is made up of one or more closed loop paths containing a magnetic flux. The flux is usually generated by permanent magnets or electromagnets and confined to the path by magnetic cores consisting of ferromagnetic materials like iron, although there may be air gaps or other materials in the path. Magnetic circuits are employed to efficiently channel magnetic fields in many devices such as electric motors, generators, transformers, relays, lifting electromagnets, SQUIDs, galvanometers, and magnetic recording heads.\n\nThe concept of a \"magnetic circuit\" exploits a one-to-one correspondence between the equations of the magnetic field in an unsaturated ferromagnetic material to that of an electrical circuit. Using this concept the magnetic fields of complex devices such as transformers can be quickly solved using the methods and techniques developed for electrical circuits.\n\nSome examples of magnetic circuits are:\n\nSimilar to the way that electromotive force (EMF) drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits, magnetomotive force (MMF) 'drives' magnetic flux through magnetic circuits. The term 'magnetomotive force', though, is a misnomer since it is not a force nor is anything moving. It is perhaps better to call it simply MMF. In analogy to the definition of EMF, the magnetomotive force formula_1 around a closed loop is defined as:\n\nThe MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical magnetic charge would gain by completing the loop. The magnetic flux that is driven is not a current of magnetic charge; it merely has the same relationship to MMF that electric current has to EMF. (See microscopic origins of reluctance below for a further description.)\n\nThe unit of magnetomotive force is the ampere-turn (At), represented by a steady, direct electric current of one ampere flowing in a single-turn loop of electrically conducting material in a vacuum. The gilbert (Gb), established by the IEC in 1930, is the CGS unit of magnetomotive force and is a slightly smaller unit than the ampere-turn. The unit is named after William Gilbert (1544–1603) English physician and natural philosopher.\n\nThe magnetomotive force can often be quickly calculated using Ampère's law. For example, the magnetomotive force formula_4 of long coil is:\n\nwhere \"N\" is the number of turns and \"I\" is the current in the coil. In practice this equation is used for the MMF of real inductors with \"N\" being the winding number of the inducting coil.\n\nAn applied MMF 'drives' magnetic flux through the magnetic components of the system. The magnetic flux through a magnetic component is proportional to the number of magnetic field lines that pass through the cross sectional area of that component. This is the \"net\" number, i.e. the number passing through in one direction, minus the number passing through in the other direction. The direction of the magnetic field vector B is by definition from the south to the north pole of a magnet inside the magnet; outside the field lines go from north to south.\n\nThe flux through an element of area perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field is given by the product of the magnetic field and the area element. More generally, magnetic flux Φ is defined by a scalar product of the magnetic field and the area element vector. Quantitatively, the magnetic flux through a surface \"S\" is defined as the integral of the magnetic field over the area of the surface\n\nFor a magnetic component the area S used to calculate the magnetic flux Φ is usually chosen to be the cross-sectional area of the component.\n\nThe SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the unit of magnetic field is the weber per square meter, or tesla.\n\nIn electronic circuits, Ohm's law is an empirical relation between the EMF formula_7 applied across an element and the current I it generates through that element. It is written as:\n\nwhere \"R\" is the electrical resistance of that material. There is a counterpart to Ohm's law used in magnetic circuits. This law is often called Hopkinson's law, after John Hopkinson, but was actually formulated earlier by Henry Augustus Rowland in 1873. It states that\n\nwhere formula_1 is the magnetomotive force (MMF) across a magnetic element, formula_11 is the magnetic flux through the magnetic element, and formula_12 is the magnetic reluctance of that element. (It will be shown later that this relationship is due to the empirical relationship between the H-field and the magnetic field B, B=\"μH\", where \"μ\" is the permeability of the material). Like Ohm's law, Hopkinson's law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.\n\nHopkinson's law is not a correct analogy with Ohm's law in terms of modelling power and energy flow. In particular, there is no power dissipation associated with a magnetic reluctance in the same way as there is a dissipation in an electrical resistance. The magnetic resistance that is a true analogy of electrical resistance in this respect is defined as the ratio of magnetomotive force and the rate of change of magnetic flux. Here rate of change of magnetic flux is standing in for electrical current and the Ohm's law analogy becomes,\n\nwhere formula_14 is the magnetic resistance. This relationship is part of an electrical-magnetic analogy called the gyrator-capacitor model and is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the reluctance model. The gyrator-capacitor model is, in turn, part of a wider group of compatible analogies used to model systems across multiple energy domains.\n\nMagnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is analogous to resistance in an electrical circuit (although it does not dissipate magnetic energy). In likeness to the way an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance. It is a scalar, \nextensive quantity, akin to electrical resistance.\n\nThe total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the MMF in a passive magnetic circuit and the magnetic flux in this circuit. In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal MMF and magnetic flux. (see phasors)\n\nThe definition can be expressed as:\n\nwhere formula_12 is the reluctance in ampere-turns per weber (a unit that is equivalent to turns per henry).\n\nMagnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by Maxwell's equations, but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials. It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance. Air and vacuum have high reluctance, while easily magnetized materials such as soft iron have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force(pull).\n\nThe inverse of reluctance is called \"permeance\".\n\nIts SI derived unit is the henry (the same as the unit of inductance, although the two concepts are distinct).\n\nThe reluctance of a magnetically uniform magnetic circuit element can be calculated as:\n\nwhere \n\nThis is similar to the equation for electrical resistance in materials, with permeability being analogous to conductivity; the reciprocal of the permeability is known as magnetic reluctivity and is analogous to resistivity. Longer, thinner geometries with low permeabilities lead to higher reluctance. Low reluctance, like low resistance in electric circuits, is generally preferred.\n\nThe following table summarizes the mathematical analogy between electrical circuit theory and magnetic circuit theory. This is mathematical analogy and not a physical one. Objects in the same row have the same mathematical role; the physics of the two theories are very different. For example, current is the flow of electrical charge, while magnetic flux is not the flow of any quantity.\n\nWhen using the analogy between magnetic circuits and electric circuits, the limitations of this analogy must be kept in mind. Electric and magnetic circuits are only superficially similar because of the similarity between Hopkinson's law and Ohm's law. Magnetic circuits have significant differences, which must be taken into account in their construction: \n\nMagnetic circuits obey other laws that are similar to electrical circuit laws. For example, the total reluctance formula_22 of reluctances formula_23 in series is:\n\nThis also follows from Ampère's law and is analogous to Kirchhoff's voltage law for adding resistances in series. Also, the sum of magnetic fluxes formula_25 into any node is always zero:\n\nThis follows from Gauss's law and is analogous to Kirchhoff's current law for analyzing electrical circuits.\n\nTogether, the three laws above form a complete system for analysing magnetic circuits, in a manner similar to electric circuits. Comparing the two types of circuits shows that:\n\nMagnetic circuits can be solved for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop is equal to the sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the magnetomotive force (achieved from ampere-turn excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch can be solved through a matrix equation—much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis—after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent loop currents as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.) Per Ampère's law, the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally:\n\nformula_28\n\nMore complex magnetic systems, where the flux is not confined to a simple loop, must be analysed from first principles by using Maxwell's equations.\n\n\nReluctance can also be applied to variable reluctance (magnetic) pickups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33224741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33224741", "title": "Marching Men", "text": "Marching Men\n\nMarching Men is a 1917 novel by American author Sherwood Anderson. Published by John Lane, the novel is Anderson's second book; the first being the 1916 novel \"Windy McPherson's Son\". \"Marching Men\" is the story of Norman \"Beaut\" McGregor, a young man discontented with the powerlessness and lack of personal ambition among the miners of his hometown. After moving to Chicago he discovers his purpose is to empower workers by having them march in unison. Major themes of the novel include the organization of laborers, eradication of disorder, and the role of the exceptional man in society. The latter theme led post-World War II critics to compare Anderson's militaristic approach to homosocial order and the fascists of the War's Axis powers.\n\n\"Marching Men\" was written as a hobby project while Sherwood Anderson was still working in advertising. A combination of a small first run, mediocre reviews, and poor sales, convinced Anderson's publisher not to give \"Marching Men\" a second run. The novel has since been reprinted several times by other publishers including a 1927 Russian translation, yet is generally forgotten by the reading public except as a step in the development of its author.\n\nLike \"Windy McPherson's Son\", Sherwood Anderson wrote his second novel while he worked as an advertising copywriter in Elyria, Ohio between 1906 and 1913, several years before he published his first literary writing and a decade before he became an established writer. At least part of \"Marching Men\" was written in an attic room of Anderson's Elyria home, which he set up to escape familial demands and focus on writing. Though the author later claimed that he had written his first novels in secret, Anderson's secretary remembers typing the manuscript on company time \"around 1911 or 1912\".\n\nInspiration for \"Marching Men\" came in part from the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the Spanish–American War which took place towards the end of the war and just after the armistice in 1898–99. Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his \"Memoirs\" about the time he had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled \"I had become a giant. ... I was, in myself, something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. I remember that I sat, for a long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes\". Combined with his later reading of works by Thomas Carlyle, Mark Twain, and possibly Jack London, Anderson had inspiration for \"Marching Men\" that was both experiential and literary.\n\nThe novel begins with the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor packaging a loaf of bread for his uncle, the \"village wit\", – who ironically nicknames him \"Beaut\" because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father \"Cracked\" McGregor). Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young man gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a \"horrible mess\" made just for that purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.\n\nBook III begins with Beaut returning to Coal Creek for his mother's funeral. During the funeral procession, the miners who attend fall spontaneously into step and Beaut is once-again inspired by the power of marching men. Back in Chicago, Edith Carson, who had gained a modicum of wealth through her shrewd business dealings, loans McGregor the money necessary for him to quit working full-time and attend school to become a lawyer, his long-time ambition. Not long after McGregor is admitted to the bar, the son of a wealthy industrialist is found murdered. In order to quell newspaper speculation as to their involvement, the political bosses decide to redirect the media's attention by framing and demonizing small-time thief Andy Brown, an acquaintance of McGregor. From jail, Brown requests that McGregor act as his lawyer. Though McGregor refuses at first, he ends up with the job. After an unsuccessful solo investigation, McGregor turns to wealthy heiress-turned-settlement house-volunteer, Margaret Ormsby, for help. Margaret, a \"new woman\" who dresses fashionably, is self-assured in demeanor, and is capable of acting independently is bothered by McGregor's bluntness, but decides to aid him nevertheless. On a tip from Edith Carson, and with Ormsby's connections, McGregor is able to clear Andy Brown of any wrongdoing. In the interim, Margaret Ormsby and McGregor develop a romance.\n\nWhile McGregor is slowly building up his idea of marching men (his law practice on the backburner), he decides that he wants to marry Margaret Ormsby. As he is leaving a formal party at her family's mansion, McGregor asks Margaret to marry him, but gets nervous and flees before she can respond. A few weeks later, McGregor falls asleep at the house of Edith Carson and wakes up with her stroking his hair. Realizing that their relationship is more intimate then he had thought, he goes to Margaret and reveals his past experiences with women. Margaret hears McGregor's confession and declares that she will still marry him, but first, she must go talk to Edith. A few weeks later, when McGregor is in the neighborhood for a teamster's strike, he finds that Edith's shop had recently come under new ownership. Rushing to the train station, he finds Edith about to depart. Together, they go to the Ormsby house and in a confrontation Margaret cedes her claim over McGregor to Edith. As Edith and McGregor are leaving, Margaret's father, David, leader of a plow trust (nicknamed \"Ormsby the Prince\" by the City's oligarchs), extends a hand to McGregor. The two men shake, the narrator noting their polite antagonism towards each other.\n\nSoon, the marching men idea blooms with workers coming together and marching to and from work in the evenings. Becoming nervous over newspaper reports and rumors of the worker gatherings, several \"men of affairs\" discuss the matter. David Ormsby volunteers to dissuade to McGregor from further organizing but cannot communicate his point to the impassive McGregor. The marching men movement peaks during a demonstration on Labor Day, climaxing with a speech by McGregor. Riding in a carriage with her father at the fringe of the demonstration, Margaret Ormsby is overcome by McGregor's oration, but later professes her allegiance to her father. The book ends that same night with a solitary David Ormsby, a foil to the stereotype of the ruthless businessman, at his window overlooking the city, meditating on his life choices: \"What if McGregor and his woman knew both roads? What if they, after looking deliberately along the road toward beauty and success in life, went, without regret, along the road to failure? What if McGregor and not myself knew the road to beauty?\"\n\nAs with Anderson's novels \"Poor White\" (1920) and \"Beyond Desire\" (1932), class struggle is a major theme in \"Marching Men\". In addition to it being dedicated \"To American Workingmen\", one critic placed \"Marching Men\" as part of a \"proletarian trend\" alongside Ernst Toller's play \"Man and the Masses\" (1920). Another critic noted the novel's plot shows \"... the inexorable clicking-into-place of a process of dialectic. It is Marxist reasoning, and imposes a vision of historical necessity upon its time\".\n\nFrom the beginning of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.\n\nTowards the end of the novel, the heretofore nascent power of the marching workers organized by McGregor is affirmed when the city's oligarchs deem it necessary to act against it. Though opposed to the oligarchs and their brand of ruthless capitalism, McGregor also rejects socialism, opting instead to act within the system as an individual with a \"... moral acknowledgement of social responsibility\".\n\nIn line with the McGregor's ideal of unified workers was a \"quest\" to make order from the chaos around him. Throughout \"Marching Men\" distinctions between order and disorder are put forward both as ruminations of the narrator and as elements of the plot. Examples of comparisons in the plot begin early on when miners in disarray are compared with organized soldiers. Later, an unbridled Chicago is contrasted with McGregor's orderly routine. Finally, the frustrated mass of job-seekers McGregor encounters upon his arrival to the city is seen against the neat groups of marching men that excite a young reporter in Book VI. Beyond plot points, phrases such as \"In the heart of all men lies sleeping the love of order ...\" and speaking of McGregor, \"His body shook with the strength of his desire to end the vast disorder of life\", among others also work to set up the dichotomy of order and chaos.\n\nDespite the repetition of this theme in the text, there is some discussion about its pervading influence. It is ironic, critic Clarence B. Lindsay posits, that while McGregor is busy organizing the marching men, he (as opposed to the narrator) all but ignores the chaos in the city he is constantly traversing. On a larger scale, it is difficult to know whether Sherwood Anderson takes seriously the nostalgic notion of Civil War soldiers marching together as an inspiration for the McGregor's \"aesthetic of power\" or whether the exaggerated traits of McGregor are, in fact, ironic representations of the benefits of order. This view is furthered by Mark Whalan who likened Anderson's \"imposition of order by masculine force\" to the \"masculine misogyny\" of the Italian Futurists many of whom, unlike Anderson (who did not actually see combat during his military service), moved away from their glorification of violence after experiencing World War I.\n\nFrom the book's opening chapter, the narrator of \"Marching Men\" portrayed McGregor as separate from those around him. Over the course of the novel McGregor is compared several times to \"certain men, all soldiers or leaders of soldiers ...\" that he reads about such as Nero and Napoleon. In fact, Anderson elevates his protagonist to the level of the \"Emersonian Great Man or Nietzschean Supermen ... \" making him the dream-object of women and envy of men from Coal Creek to Chicago. His size and strength, which is noted even during his teenage years is later joined by brains when he completes night school and becomes a lawyer.\n\nTo some critics McGregor's exceptionalism helps \"Marching Men\" read as a proletarian novel, while others see in it an antecedent to the grotesqueness of the characters in Anderson's 1919 short story cycle, \"Winesburg, Ohio\". To biographer John Earl Bassett, McGregor represents, in part, the author's disdain and fear for parts of modern American life, \"... that America will breed Beaut McGregors—talented, charismatic, romantic, cruel—who will use their powers to achieve frightening goals\". Combining the ideas of an exceptional leader and unified workers has raised questions among critics concerning the parallels between the \"militaristic impulse\" in \"Marching Men\" and the fascism of the WWII-era, a charge Anderson acknowledged in his posthumously-published \"Memoirs\".\n\nUpon publication, reviews of \"Marching Men\" were moderate with a small number of reviewers taking strong negative stances. In one such review, an anonymous critic from the \"New York Times Book Review\" noted that the beginning of the novel was \"sufficiently well done to lead the reader to expect a novel of possibly a trifle more than average interest and average merit\" but ultimately concludes that neither McGregor, \"nor the book ever seems to get anywhere in particular\". Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development and anti-climactic ending. Aside from these faults, several critics also commented on \"Marching Men\"'s \"deliberate vagueness\", calling the book a \"generous if misty vision of the future\".\n\nDespite the book's deficiencies, reviewers were practically unanimous in praising the realistic description and mood of Anderson's settings from Coal Creek to Chicago. Within these settings, McGregor's scheme was acknowledged by the even-tempered \"New York Tribune\" reviewer as a \"clever and original idea\". Others, like editor Francis Hackett wrote \"Where \"Marching Men\" succeeds is in thrusting the greater American realities before us ...\" to which critic George Bernard Donlin, in his \"Dial\" review, adds \"Mr. Anderson's book interested me chiefly as the expression of a vigorous and sincere mind ...\".\n\nWritten almost a decade before Sherwood Anderson established himself as a writer with the release of his 1919 short story cycle, \"Winesburg, Ohio\", \"Marching Men\" is generally considered, along with \"Windy McPherson's Sons\" and two other unpublished novels, as one of Anderson's \"apprentice novels\". Viewed in hindsight, the shiftless plot and weak ending of \"Marching Men\" can be seen as a precursor to similar criticism in Anderson's later novels.\n\n\"Marching Men\" was the second book of Anderson's three-book contract with the publisher John Lane (the first being \"Windy McPherson's Son\" (1916) and the third being \"Mid-American Chants\", published in 1918). A first edition of 2,500 copies was printed, but poor sales (around 1,000 copies) kept the novel from being reprinted until B.W. Huebsch picked it up in 1921 following Anderson's success with \"Winesburg, Ohio\", novel \"Poor White\", and short story collection \"The Triumph of an Egg\". In 1972, the Press of Case Western Reserve University put out a critical edition of \"Marching Men\" with an introduction by noted Sherwood Anderson scholar Ray Lewis White which used as its basis Anderson's early manuscripts in addition to the John Lane/B.W. Huebsch version. A Russian edition of \"Marching Men\" was published as \"V Nogu!\" (loosely translated, \"In Step\") (Leningrad: Mysl, 1927).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19471895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19471895", "title": "Negative affectivity", "text": "Negative affectivity\n\nNegative affectivity (NA), or negative affect, is a personality variable that involves the experience of negative emotions and poor self-concept. Negative affectivity subsumes a variety of negative emotions, including anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, and nervousness. Low negative affectivity is characterized by frequent states of calmness and serenity, along with states of confidence, activeness, and great enthusiasm.\n\nIndividuals differ in negative emotional reactivity. Trait negative affectivity roughly corresponds to the dominant personality factor of anxiety/neuroticism that is found within the Big Five personality traits as emotional stability. The Big Five are characterized as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Neuroticism can plague an individual with severe mood swings, frequent sadness, worry, and being easily disturbed, and predicts the development and onset of all \"common\" mental disorders. Research shows that negative affectivity relates to different classes of variables: Self-reported stress and (poor) coping skills, health complaints, and frequency of unpleasant events. Weight gain and mental health complaints are often experienced as well.\n\nPeople who express high negative affectivity view themselves and a variety of aspects of the world around them in generally negative terms. Negative affectivity is strongly related to life satisfaction. Individuals high in negative affect will exhibit, on average, higher levels of distress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction, and tend to focus on the unpleasant aspects of themselves, the world, the future, and other people, and also evoke more negative life events. The similarities between these affective traits and life satisfaction have led some researchers to view both positive and negative affect with life satisfaction as specific indicators of the broader construct of subjective well-being.\n\nNegative affect arousal mechanisms can induce negative affective states as evidenced by a study conducted by Stanley S. Seidner on negative arousal and white noise. The study quantified reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican participants in response to the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins.\n\nThere are many instruments that can be used to measure negative affectivity, including measures of related concepts, such as neuroticism and trait anxiety. Two frequently used are:\n\nPANAS – The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule incorporates a 10-item negative affect scale. The PANAS-X is an expanded version of PANAS that incorporates negative affect subscales for Fear, Sadness, Guilt, Hostility, and Shyness.\n\nI-PANAS-SF – The International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form is an extensively validated brief, cross-culturally reliable 10-item version of the PANAS. Negative Affect items are Afraid, Ashamed, Hostile, Nervous and Upset. Internal consistency reliabilities between .72 and .76 are reported. The I-PANAS-SF was developed to eliminate redundant and ambiguous items and thereby derive an efficient measure for general use in research situations where either time or space are limited, or where international populations are of interest but where English may not be the mother tongue.\n\nRecent studies indicate that negative affect has important, beneficial impacts on cognition and behavior. These developments are a remarkable departure from past psychological research, which is characterized by a unilateral emphasis on the benefits of positive affect. Both states of affect influence mental processes and behavior. Negative affect is regularly recognized as a \"stable, heritable trait tendency to experience a broad range of negative feelings, such as worry, anxiety, self-criticisms, and a negative self-view\". This allows one to feel every type of emotion, which is regarded as a normal part of life and human nature. So, while the emotions themselves are viewed as negative, the individual experiencing them should not be classified as a negative person or depressed. They are going through a normal process and are feeling something that many individuals may not be able to feel or process due to differing problems.\n\nThese findings complement evolutionary psychology theories that affective states serve adaptive functions in promoting suitable cognitive strategies to deal with environmental challenges. Positive affect is associated with assimilative, top-down processing used in response to familiar, benign environments. Negative affect is connected with accommodative, bottom-up processing in response to unfamiliar, or problematic environments. Thus, positive affectivity promotes simplistic heuristic approaches that rely on preexisting knowledge and assumptions. Conversely, negative affectivity promotes controlled, analytic approaches that rely on externally drawn information.\n\nBenefits of negative affect are present in areas of cognition including perception, judgment, memory and interpersonal personal relations. Since negative affect relies more on cautious processing than preexisting knowledge, people with negative affect tend to perform better in instances involving deception, manipulation, impression formation, and stereotyping. Negative affectivity's analytical and detailed processing of information leads to fewer reconstructive-memory errors, whereas positive mood relies on broader schematic to thematic information that ignores detail. Thus, information processing in negative moods reduces the misinformation effect and increases overall accuracy of details. People also exhibit less interfering responses to stimuli when given descriptions or performing any cognitive task.\n\nPeople are notoriously susceptible to forming inaccurate judgments based on biases and limited information. Evolutionary theories propose that negative affective states tend to increase skepticism and decrease reliance on preexisting knowledge. Consequently, judgmental accuracy is improved in areas such as impression formation, reducing fundamental attribution error, stereotyping, and gullibility. While sadness is normally associated with the hippocampus, it does not produce the same side effects that would be associated with feelings of pleasure or excitement. Sadness correlates with feeling blue or the creation of tears, while excitement may cause a spike in blood pressure and one's pulse. As far as judgment goes, most people think about how they themselves feel about a certain situation. They will jump right to their current mood when asked a question. However, some mistake this process when using their current mood to justify a reaction to a stimulus. If you're sad, yet only a little bit, chances are your reactions and input will be negative as a whole.\n\nFirst impressions are one of the most basic forms of judgments people make on a daily basis; yet judgment formation is a complex and fallible process. Negative affect is shown to decrease errors in forming impressions based on presuppositions. One common judgment error is the halo effect, or the tendency to form unfounded impressions of people based on known but irrelevant information. For instance, more attractive people are often attributed with more positive qualities. Research demonstrates that positive affect tends to increase the halo effect, whereas negative affect decreases it.\n\nA study involving undergraduate students demonstrated a halo effect in identifying a middle-aged man as more likely to be a philosopher than an unconventional, young woman. These halo effects were nearly eliminated when participants were in a negative affective state. In the study, researchers sorted participants into either happy or sad groups using an autobiographical mood induction task in which participants reminisced on sad or happy memories. Then, participants read a philosophical essay by a fake academic who was identified as either a middle-aged, bespectacled man or as a young, unorthodox-looking woman. The fake writer was evaluated on intelligence and competence. The positive affect group exhibited a strong halo effect, rating the male writer significantly higher than the female writer in competence. The negative affect group exhibited almost no halo effects rating the two equally. Researchers concluded that impression formation is improved by negative affect. Their findings support theories that negative affect results in more elaborate processing based upon external, available information.\n\nThe systematic, attentive approach caused by negative affect reduces fundamental attribution error, the tendency to inaccurately attribute behavior to a person's internal character without taking external, situational factors into account. The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is connected with positive affect since it occurs when people use top-down cognitive processing based on inferences. Negative affect stimulates bottom-up, systematic analysis that reduces fundamental attribution error.\n\nThis effect is documented in FAE research in which students evaluated a fake debater on attitude and likability based on an essay the \"debater\" wrote. After being sorted into positive or negative affect groups, participants read one of two possible essays arguing for one side or another on a highly controversial topic. Participants were informed that the debater was assigned a stance to take in the essay that did not necessarily reflect his views. Still, the positive affect groups rated debaters who argued unpopular views as holding the same attitude expressed in the essay. They were also rated as unlikeable compared to debaters with popular stances, thus, demonstrating FAE. In contrast, the data for the negative affect group displayed no significant difference in ratings for debaters with popular stance and debaters with unpopular stances. These results indicate that positive affect assimilation styles promote fundamental attribution error, and negative affect accommodation styles minimize the error in respect to judging people.\n\nNegative affect benefits judgment in diminishing the implicit use of stereotypes by promoting closer attention to stimuli. In one study, participants were less likely to discriminate against targets that appeared Muslim when in a negative affective state. After organizing participants into positive and negative affect groups, researchers had them play a computer game. Participants had to make rapid decisions to shoot only at targets carrying a gun. Some of the targets wore turbans making them appear Muslim. As expected, there was a significant bias against Muslim targets resulting in a tendency to shoot at them. However, this tendency decreased with subjects in negative affective states. Positive affect groups developed more aggressive tendencies toward Muslims. Researchers concluded that negative affect leads to less reliance on internal stereotypes, thus decreasing judgmental bias.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that negative affectivity has a beneficial role in increasing skepticism and decreasing gullibility. Because negative affective states increase external analysis and attention to details, people in negative states are better able to detect deception.\n\nResearchers have presented findings in which students in negative affective states had improved lie detection compared to students in positive affective states. In a study, students watched video clips of everyday people either lying or telling the truth. First, music was used to induce positive, negative, or neutral affect in participants. Then, experimenters played 14 video messages that had to be identified by participants as true or false. As expected, the negative affect group performed better in veracity judgments than the positive affect group who performed no better than chance. Researchers believe that the negative affect groups detected deception more successfully because they attended to stimulus details and systematically built inferences from those details.\n\nMemory has been found to have many failures that effect the accuracy of recalled memories. This has been especially pragmatic in criminal settings as eyewitness memories have been found to be less reliable than one would hope. However, the externally focused and accommodative processing of negative affect has a positive effect on the overall improvement of memory. This evidenced by reduction of the misinformation effect and the number of false memories reported. The knowledge implies that negative affect can be used to enhance eyewitness memory; however, additional research suggests that the extent to which memory is improved by negative affect does not sufficiently improve eyewitness testimonies to significantly reduce its error.\n\nNegative affect has been shown to decrease susceptibility of incorporating misleading information, which is related to the misinformation effect. The misinformation effect refers to the finding that misleading information presented between the encoding of an event and its subsequent recall influences a witness's memory. This corresponds to two types of memory failure:\n\nNegative mood is shown to decrease suggestibility error. This is seen through reduced amounts of incorporation of false memories when misleading information is present. On the other hand, positive affect has shown to increase susceptibility to misleading information. An experiment with undergraduate students supported these results. Participants began the study in a lecture hall and witnessed what they thought was an unexpected five-minute belligerent encounter between an intruder and the lecturer. A week later, these participants watched a 10-minute-long video that generated either a positive, negative or neutral mood. They then completed a brief questionnaire about the previous incident between the intruder and lecturer that they witnessed the week earlier. In this questionnaire half of the participants received questions with misleading information and the other half received questions without any misleading information. This manipulation was used to determine if participants were susceptible to suggestibility failure. After 45 minutes of unrelated distractors participants were given a set of true or false questions which tested for false memories. Participants experiencing negative moods reported fewer numbers of false memories, whereas those experiencing positive moods reported a greater amount of false memories. This implies that positive affect promotes integration of misleading details and negative affect reduces the misinformation effect.\n\nPeople who experience negative affectivity following an event report fewer reconstructive false memories. This was evidenced by two studies conducted around public events. The first surrounded the events of the televised O.J. Simpson trial. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires three times: one week, two months and a year after the televised verdict. These questionnaires measured participant emotion towards the verdict and the accuracy of their recalled memory of what occurred during the trial. Overall the study found that although participant response to the event outcome did not affect the quantity of remembered information, it did influence the likelihood of false memory. Participants who were pleased with the verdict of the O.J. Simpson trial were more likely to falsely believe something occurred during the trial than those who were displeased with the verdict. Another experiment found the same findings with Red Sox fans and Yankees fans in their overall memory of events that occurred in the final game of a 2004 playoff series in which the Red Sox defeated the Yankees. The study found that the Yankees fans had better memory of events that occurred than the Red Sox fans. The results from both of these experiments are consistent with the findings that negative emotion can lead to fewer memory errors and thus increased memory accuracy of events.\n\nAlthough negative affect has been shown to decrease the misinformation effect, the degree to which memory is improved is not enough to make a significant effect on witness testimony. In fact, emotions, including negative affect, are shown to reduce accuracy in identifying perpetrators from photographic lineups. Researchers demonstrated this effect in an experiment in which participants watched a video that induced either negative emotion or a neutral mood. The two videos were deliberately similar except for the action of interest, which was either a mugging (negative emotion) or a conversation (neutral emotion). After watching one of the two videos participants are shown perpetrator lineups, which either contained the target perpetrator from the video or a foil, a person that looked similar to the target. The results revealed that the participants who watched the emotion-induced video were more likely to incorrectly identify the innocent foil than to correctly identify the perpetrator. Neutral participants were more likely to correctly identify the perpetrator in comparison to their emotional counterparts. This demonstrates that emotional affect in forensic settings decreases accuracy of eyewitness memory. These findings are consistent with prior knowledge that stress and emotion greatly impair eyewitness ability to recognitive perpetrators.\n\nNegative affectivity can produce several interpersonal benefits. It can cause subjects to be more polite and considerate with others. Unlike positive mood, which causes less assertive approaches, negative affectivity can, in many ways, cause a person to be more polite and elaborate when making requests.\n\nNegative affectivity increases the accuracy of social perceptions and inferences. Specifically, high negative-affectivity people have more negative, but accurate, perceptions of the impression they make to others. People with low negative affectivity form overly-positive, potentially inaccurate impression of others that can lead to misplaced trust.\n\nA research conducted by Forgas J.P studied how affectivity can influence intergroup discrimination. He measured affectivity by how people allocate rewards to in-group and out-group members. In the procedure, participants had to describe their interpretations after looking at patterns of judgments about people. Afterwards, participants were exposed to a mood induction process, where they had to watch videotapes designed to elicit negative or positive affectivity. Results showed that participants with positive affectivity were more negative and discriminated more than participants with negative affectivity. Also, happy participants were more likely to discriminate between in-group and out-group members than sad participants. Negative affect is often associated with team selection. It is viewed as a trait that could make selecting individuals for a team irrelevant, thus preventing knowledge from becoming known or predicted for current issues that may arise.\n\nNegative affectivity subconsciously signals a challenging social environment.\nNegative mood may increase a tendency to conform to social norms.\n\nIn a study, college students where exposed to a mood induction process. After the mood induction process, participants were required to watch a show with positive and negative elements. After watching the show, they were asked to engage on a hypothetical conversation in which they \"describe the episode (they) just observed to a friend\". Their speech was recorded and transcribed during this task. Results showed that speakers in a negative mood had a better quality descriptions and greater amount of information and details. These results show that negative mood can improve people's communication skills.\n\nA negative mood is closely linked to better conversation because it makes use of the hippocampus and different regions of the brain. When someone is upset, that individual may see or hear things differently than an individual who is very upbeat and happy all the time. The small details the negative individual picks up may be something completely overlooked before. Anxiety disorders are often associated with over-thinking and ruminating on topics that would seem irrelevant and pointless to an individual without a disorder. OCD is one common anxiety trait that allows the affected individual a different insight on how things may appear to be. A person that makes use of his or her negative affect has a different view of the world and what goes on in it, thus making their conversations different and interesting to others.\n\nResults of one study show that participants with negative affectivity were more careful with the information they shared with others, being more cautious with who they could trust or not. Researchers found that negative mood not only decreases intimacy levels but also increases caution in placing trust in others.\n\n\n"}

Its closure was announced in the \"Chronicle of Philanthropy\" in April 2014.\n\nThe NMI was started by the Effective Philanthropy Group at the Hewlett Foundation in 2006 with the goal that \"by 2015, ten percent of individual philanthropic donations in the US (or $20 billion), would be influenced by meaningful, high-quality information about nonprofit organizations’ performance.\" Jacob Harold was the program officer responsible, and the Hewlett Foundation at the time was headed by Paul Brest.\n\nThe NMI funded a number of charity evaluators including:\n\n\nHolden Karnofsky, co-founder and co-executive director of GiveWell, expressed gratitude to the NMI, saying that NMI's support of the organization was crucial in its first few years, when it was relatively unknown and the subject of unfavorable controversies. He also praised the NMI for their support despite differences in strategy and approach, and said that while the NMI often encouraged them to spread a wider net and collaborate more with other NMI grantees, they were never inappropriately pressured.\n\nKen Berger, President of Charity Navigator, wrote a letter upon the closure of the NMI thanking the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of Charity Navigator through their transition to version 3.0 of their product. Berger identified the Hewlett Foundation as the single biggest overall supporter of Charity Navigator.\n\nIn April 2014, an article the \"Chronicle of Philanthropy\" announced that the Hewlett Foundation was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative. The Hewlett Foundation's decision was based on an internal re-evaluation of the project, motivated by two external pieces of information:\n\n\nThe Hewlett Foundation also had some significant personnel changes over the time period: Jacob Harold left the Hewlett Foundation for GuideStar and was replaced by Lindsay Louise, while Paul Brest was replaced by Larry Kramer as President of the Hewlett Foundation. They said that these changes made it more logical for them to re-evaluate the strategy, but was not the reason for ending the program, since the external studies and evaluations that would lead to the program's cosure had been initiated under the previous staff.\n\nThe Hewlett Foundation also clarified that even though they had failed to met their own goals with the NMI, the organizations they funded, such as GiveWell, Charity Navigator, and GuideStar, had done a great job at meeting \"those organization's\" goals.\n\nResponding to the closure decision, Holden Karnofsky of GiveWell wrote that while the decision to shut down the program may have been the right one, GiveWell did not agree with the stated reasons for closure. Karnofsky argued that GiveWell's money moved in the years to come would alone more than justify the grand total of 12 million dollars spent on the NMI. This would be validated in the years to come: in 2014, GiveWell moved $13.0 million to its top charities from donors \"excluding\" Good Ventures, a multi-billion dollar foundation it works closely with.\n\nJacob Harold, the program officer formerly responsible for NMI, who had since left for GuideStar, responded to Karnofsky's post, noting that the NMI's goals of reaching a large population were still worthwhile, and that its main problem may have been that it was too early for its time. Harold noted that he hoped to make the vision the NMI sought a reality through his work for GuideStar. He emphasized the importance of both quality and quantity, noting that GiveWell and the effective altruism movement it was part of might be too neglectful of the quantity goals that the NMI had.\n"}

Some such objects are abstractions, literary concepts, or fictional scenarios.\n\nClosely related are intentional objects, which are what thoughts and feelings are about, even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts \nabout unicorns, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled). However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment).\n\nMathematics and geometry describe abstract objects that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are objects of the mind. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.\n\nMany more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the Klein bottle is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the Möbius strip). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.\n\nIf-then arguments posit logical sequences that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a counterfactual argument proposes a hypothetical or subjunctive possibility which \"could\" or \"would\" be true, but \"might not\" be false. Conditional sequences involving subjunctives use intensional language, which is studied by modal logic, whereas classical logic studies the extensional language of necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nIn general, a logical antecedent is a sufficient condition, and a logical consequent is a necessary condition(or the contingency) in a logical conditional. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as material conditionals. In contrast, indicative conditionals, sometimes known as non-material conditionals, attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.\n\nTruth tables for if-then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. Strict conditionals assign a positive truth-value to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.\n\nA false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.\n\nThe subjects of literature are sometimes false antecedents. For example, the contents of false documents, the origins of stand-alone phenomena, or the implications of loaded words. Also, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as \"nothing\", or \"nonexistent\", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.\n\nArt and acting often portray scenarios without any antecedent except an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods, and goddesses.\n\nA false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a non sequitur, which literally means \"out of sequence\". A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.\n\nAs an example, the name of a team, a genre, or a nation is a collective term applied ex post facto to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by consensus or reference, but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different social or political significance.\n\nIn philosophy, mind-body dualism is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by René Descartes in \"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\n\nMany objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is based on an imaginary book. In the \"Appendices\" to \"The Lord of the Rings\", Tolkien's characters name the \"Red Book of Westmarch\" as the source material for \"The Lord of the Rings\", which they describe as a translation. But the \"Red Book of Westmarch\" is a fictional document that chronicles events in an imaginary world. One might imagine a different translation, by another author.\n\nSocial reality is composed of many standards and inventions that facilitate communication, but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, money is an object of the mind which currency represents. Similarly, languages signify ideas and thoughts.\n\nObjects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, acting is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. Charades is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts.\n\nImaginary personalities and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the verisimilitude of fictional universes, and/or the immersion of role-playing games. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames.\n\nScience fiction is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" by George Orwell, the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed.\n\nCalendar dates also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In \"\", which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, \"It is the year 2005.\" In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, \"The Transformers: The Movie\" is retro-futuristic. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change.\n\nDeliberate invention also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of deception is usually referred to as lying, in contrast to invention for entertainment or art. Invention is also often applied to problem solving. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the mental invention of fictions.\n\nConvenient fictions also occur in science.\n\nThe theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere objects of the mind by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include phlogiston and ptolemaic epicycles.\n\nThis raises questions, in the debate between scientific realism and instrumentalism about the status of current posits, such as black holes and quarks. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct?\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose—convenient fictions. Examples include field lines, centers of gravity, and electron holes in semiconductor theory.\n\nA reference that names an imaginary source is in some sense also a self-reference. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference.\n\nIn their respective imaginary worlds the \"Necronomicon\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", and the \"Red Book of Westmarch\" are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to pretend or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.\n\nAustrian philosopher Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects. Starting with the “principle of intentionality”, mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object. People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist. Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1062901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1062901", "title": "Orthogenesis", "text": "Orthogenesis\n\nOrthogenesis, also known as orthogenetic evolution, progressive evolution, evolutionary progress, or progressionism, is the biological hypothesis that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in a definite direction towards some goal (teleology) due to some internal mechanism or \"driving force\". According to the theory, the largest-scale trends in evolution have an absolute goal such as increasing biological complexity. Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and Henri Bergson.\n\nThe term \"orthogenesis\" was introduced by Wilhelm Haacke in 1893 and popularized by Theodor Eimer five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of natural selection as the organizing mechanism in evolution for a rectilinear model of directed evolution. With the emergence of the modern synthesis, in which genetics was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other alternatives to Darwinism were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr made the term effectively taboo in the journal \"Nature\" in 1948, by stating that it implied \"some supernatural force\". The American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with vitalism by describing it as \"the mysterious inner force\". Modern supporters include E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.\n\nThe philosopher of biology Michael Ruse notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the \"March of Progress\", from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.\n\nThe term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, \"straight\", and γένεσις génesis, \"origin\") was first used by the biologist Wilhelm Haacke in 1893. Theodor Eimer was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as \"the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups\".\n\nIn 1922, the zoologist Michael F. Guyer wrote:\n\nAccording to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:\n\nIn 1988, Francisco J. Ayala defined progress as \"systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature\". He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is \"improvement\". This may be compared to Stephen Jay Gould's suggestion of \"replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality\".\n\nIn 1989, Peter J. Bowler defined orthogenesis as:\n\nIn 1996, Michael Ruse defined orthogenesis as \"the view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks\".\n\nThe possibility of progress is embedded in the mediaeval great chain of being, with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in Aristotle's biology, from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in Ramon Lull's \"Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind\", 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.\n\nThe orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as Lamarckism were being proposed. The French zoologist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the \"mysterious inner force\" of orthogenesis. Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in invertebrate paleontology thought there was a gradual and constant directional change. Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was teleological (had a definite goal). Charles Darwin himself rarely used the term \"evolution\" now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647.\n\nRuse observed that \"Progress \"(sic, his capitalisation)\" became essentially a nineteenth-century belief. It gave meaning to life—it offered inspiration—after the collapse [with Malthus's pessimism and the shock of the French revolution] of the foundations of the past.\"\nThe Russian biologist Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876) argued for an orthogenetic force in nature, reasoning in a review of Darwin's 1859 \"On the Origin of Species\" that \"Forces which are not directed—so-called blind forces—can never produce order.\" \nIn 1864, the Swiss anatomist Albert von Kölliker (1817–1905) presented his orthogenetic theory, \"heterogenesis\", arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.\nIn 1884, the Swiss botanist Carl Nägeli (1817–1891) proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an \"inner perfecting principle\". Gregor Mendel died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an \"idioplasm\" transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics. According to Nägeli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed. Charles Darwin saw this as a serious challenge, replying that \"There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference\", but was unable to provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics. Further, Darwin was himself somewhat progressionist, believing for example that \"Man\" was \"higher\" than the barnacles he studied.\nDarwin indeed wrote in his 1859 \"Origin of Species\":\n\nIn 1898, after studying butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, \"On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation\". Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance that would be difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book \"Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics According to the Laws of Organic Growth\". He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.\n\nNumerous versions of orthogenesis (see table) have been proposed. Debate centred on whether such theories were scientific, or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological. For example, biologists such as Maynard M. Metcalf (1914), John Merle Coulter (1915), David Starr Jordan (1920) and Charles B. Lipman (1922) claimed evidence for orthogenesis in bacteria, fish populations and plants. \nIn 1950, the German paleontologist Otto Schindewolf argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.\nIn 1964 George Gaylord Simpson argued that orthogenetic theories such as those promulgated by Du Noüy and Sinnott were essentially theology rather than biology.\n\nThough evolution is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely consistent with the modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes been referred to as \"orthoselection\" but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.\n\nRecent work has supported the mechanism and existence of mutation-biased adaptation, meaning that limited local orthogenesis is now seen as possible.\n\nFor the columns for other philosophies of evolution (i.e., combined theories including any of Lamarckism, Mutationism, Natural selection, and Vitalism), \"yes\" means that person definitely supports the theory; \"no\" means explicit opposition to the theory; a blank means the matter is apparently not discussed, not part of the theory.\n\nThe various alternatives to Darwinian evolution by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist Edward Drinker Cope is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in embryology and palaeontology. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, \"bathmism\", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism. Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.\n\nThe stronger versions of the orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with the patterns found by paleontologists in the fossil record, which were non-rectilinear (richly branching) with many complications. The hypothesis was abandoned by the mainstream of evolutionists when no mechanism could be found that would account for the process, and the theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail. The historian of biology Edward J. Larson commented that\n\nThe modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the methodological naturalism of the sciences.\n\nBy 1948, the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, as editor of the journal \"Evolution\", made the use of the term \"orthogenesis\" taboo: \"It might be well to abstain from use of the word 'orthogenesis' .. since so many of the geneticists seem to be of the opinion that the use of the term implies some supernatural force.\" With the rise of evolutionary developmental biology in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, however, which is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates the physics of self-organization, ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory.\n\nFor these and other reasons, belief in evolutionary progress has remained \"a persistent heresy\", among evolutionary biologists including E. O. Wilson and Simon Conway Morris, although often denied or veiled. The philosopher of biology Michael Ruse wrote that \"some of the most significant of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work.\" He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of evolutionary biology as a mature, professional science. Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans at the top of the \"Tower of Time\" in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., while \"Scientific American\" magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.\n\nIn popular culture, progressionist images of evolution are widespread. The historian Jennifer Tucker, writing in \"The Boston Globe\", notes that Thomas Henry Huxley's 1863 illustration comparing the skeletons of apes and humans \"has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution.\" She calls its history extraordinary, saying that it is \"one of the most intriguing, and most misleading, drawings in the modern history of science.\" Nobody, Tucker observes, supposes that the \"monkey-to-man\" sequence accurately depicts Darwinian evolution. \"The Origin of Species\" had only one illustration, a diagrams showing that random events create a process of branching evolution, a view that Tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists. But Huxley's image recalled the great chain of being, implying with the force of a visual image a \"logical, evenly paced progression\" leading up to \"Homo sapiens\", a view denounced by Stephen Jay Gould in \"Wonderful Life\".\n\nPopular perception, however, had seized upon the idea of linear progress. Edward Linley Sambourne's \"Man is But a Worm\", drawn for \"Punch's Almanack\", mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls Michelangelo's figure of Adam in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including \"The New Yorker\"'s 1925 \"The Rise and Fall of Man\", the sequence running from a chimpanzee to Neanderthal man, Socrates, and finally the lawyer William Jennings Bryan who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the Scopes Trial on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution. Tucker noted that Rudolph Franz Zallinger's 1965 \"The Road to Homo Sapiens\" fold-out illustration in F. Clark Howell's \"Early Man\", showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries \"not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram.\" Howell ruefully commented that the \"powerful and emotional\" graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text.\n\nScientists, Ruse argues, continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like Richard Dawkins embed the idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, memes, that act much like genes. Dawkins can speak of \"progressive rather than random ... trends in evolution\". Dawkins and John Krebs deny the \"earlier [Darwinian] prejudice\" that there is anything \"inherently progressive about evolution\", but the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary arms races which remain in Dawkins's words \"by far the most satisfactory explanation for the existence of the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess\".\n\nRuse concludes his detailed analysis of the idea of \"Progress\", meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a pseudoscience; Darwin made it respectable, but \"only as popular science\". \"There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years\", until mathematicians such as Fisher provided \"both models and status\", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the modern synthesis of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to \"people [biologists] still firmly committed to Progress\" as a philosophy.\n\nBiology has largely rejected the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example is the development of wing pattern in some species of \"Heliconius\" butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3963060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3963060", "title": "Personal branding", "text": "Personal branding\n\nPersonal branding is the practice of people marketing themselves and their careers as brands. While previous self-help management techniques were about self-\"improvement\", the personal-branding concept suggests instead that success comes from self-\"packaging\". The term is thought to have been first used and discussed in a 1997 article by Tom Peters.\n\nPersonal branding is essentially the ongoing process of establishing a prescribed image or impression in the mind of others about an individual, group, or organization. Personal branding often involves the application of one's name to various products. For example, the celebrity real-estate mogul turned President of the United States, Donald Trump uses his last name extensively on his buildings and on the products he endorses. (e.g. Trump Tower). In \"Be Your Own Brand\" first published in 1999, marketers David McNally and Karl Speak define personal brand this way: \"Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you.\" Kim Kardashian has a strong personal brand since she is considered a very influential person, thus every product she endorses, skyrockets on the market. Hence why companies look out for her due to the influential power she has in the media.\n\nThe relationship between brands and consumers needs to be constantly made and remade, and this continuous process creates a demonstration of the ambivalence in brand cultures. This same logic follows for personal brands- there is a constant desire for a reinforcement of the self-brand.\n\nPersonal branding, self-positioning, and all individual branding by whatever name, was first introduced in 1937 in the book \"Think and Grow Rich\" by Napoleon Hill. This relates specifically to Chapter 6, Organized Planning, Planning the Sale of Services, where Hill states, \"It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS.\" The idea surfaced later in the 1981 book \"Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind\", by Al Ries and Jack Trout. More specifically in \"Chapter 23. Positioning Yourself and Your Career - You can benefit by using positioning strategy to advance your own career. Key principle: Don't try to do everything yourself. Find a horse to ride\". It was later popularized by Tom Peters.\n\nBranding has reached a new level of imperative because of the rise of the Internet. The growth of the virtual world created the necessity of managing online identities. Despite being expressly virtual, social media and online identity has the ability to affect the real world. Because Individuals want to portray themselves a certain way to their social circle, they may work to maintain a certain image on their social media sites. As a result, social media enables the creation of an online identity that may not be completely true to the real self. (See: online identity)\n\nToday, added emphasis is placed on personal branding, especially in the online world. Employers are now increasingly using social media tools in order to vet applicants before offering them interviews. Such techniques range from searching the applicants Facebook or Twitter feed to conducting large background checks using search engines and other tools.\n\nAmongst job-seekers, this is leading to a shift away from the practice of submitting a resume as part of their job application process to providing potential employers with access to a number of personal brand assets. Such assets are likely to include a resume, links to a carefully managed LinkedIn profile and a personal blog, evidence of articles which disseminate original ideas on industry blogs, and evidence of having an online following. Such efforts give job-seekers better odds of being noticed by potential employers.\n\nErving Goffman's Self Presentation is a key theory that explores the way people want to be seen and how people are perceived by their peers. Goffman, uses the term Dramaturgy as a component to his theory of self-presentation. This term refers to looking at your own persona as a drama, treating your actions as an actor in a play. One can control how he or she is viewed by their peers and in cases of celebrities or athletes, can build a personal brand through utilizing what they present to their publics using various social media outlets. Self-presentation theory and personal branding go hand in hand, we see celebrities and athletes building a particular brand, or persona over with the use of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Building a personal brand is a big part of a celebrity's life, and it can help them spread awareness and also provide an outlet to connect with their fans/supporters. This is made possible through the use of social media and the ability of the person looking to build a personal brand to make their messages heard. The theory of self-presentation looks at how people look to create an identity for themselves that they would like to be seen as by their peers or in the public eye. This is what Goffman call's the 'front stage'.\n\nThe front stage is a key component of this theory and it is a way a person acts when in public or around other people to build a certain persona for how they would like others to view them. The front stage is where celebrities and athletes tend to build their own brand and show many positive, deliberate messages that will try and portray them in a certain light in which the person would like to be seen. As opposed to what Goffman refer's to as the 'back stage' which is a particular way a person acts when they are not in public or not posting on social media, trying to build a particular persona or brand they would like others to see.\n\nThere are many examples of celebrities building a brand for themselves over some sort of social media platform. In fact, it is rare to see an athlete or celebrity without a social media page whether it is twitter or instagram. Celebrities use these outlets as ways of branding themselves, by showing people their lives and having fans feel close to them, almost like they are friends, and have a connection through social media outlets such as twitter and instagram. Also, to keep more of their fans interested, and to reach as many as possible many celebrities will update daily on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat so their message can be seen by a wider audience. They can keep fans informed on everything from what they want to wear, to their political views. Social Media has provided a simple way for celebrities to get their personal brand to reach a wider audience, and they utilize the 'front stage' to influence people in a particular way and to make themselves look good in the public eye.\n\nThe 'back stage' is part of Goffman's theory of self-presentation theory, and it is happenings or beliefs people wouldn't want their peers or public to necessarily see or hear. These are happenings that go on behind the scenes that can oftentimes hurt someone's reputation and are avoided when a celebrity is trying to build a personal brand. These are often personal happenings, or beliefs that will negatively effect how an audience will look at the brand you are building. There are numerous examples of celebrities saying something that they didn't want their public to hear but got out and this hurts the brand they are building. One example of this is when LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling made racist comments to his then girlfriend and she had recorded them and put them on her social media. Donald Sterling was quickly removed from the team and is no longer associated with the NBA. This is an example of how something in the back stage will negatively affect what you want the public to see you as.\n\nSelf-presentation theory is very apparent in the world of celebrities and professional athletes and is a big part of building a brand for themselves. Goffman's theory seems to identify itself well with the personal branding of these celebrities and you can see why they would want to utilize social media to positively show a message they want to be heard by their public (front stage) and avoid more personal beliefs that may negatively effect their brand (back stage).\n\nSocial media can be \"roughly defined as 'a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content'\". Social media extends beyond just Facebook and Twitter and into the professional world as well. There are general professional profiles like LinkedIn and company or industry-specific networks, such as Slack. Because of these professional networks, self-branding is useful in finding a job or improving one's professional standing. As an online open source, social media has become a place that is fulfilled with highly reliable and resourceful information to target user identities.\n\nBuilding a brand and an online presence through internal corporate networks allows for individuals to network with their colleagues, not only socially but professionally as well. This kind of interaction allows for employees to build up their personal brand relative to other employees, as well as spur innovation within the company because more people can learn from more people.\n\nSome social media sites, like Twitter, can have a flattened, all-encompassing audience that can be composed of professional and personal contacts, which then can be seen as a more \"'professional' environment with potential professional costs\". Because of its explicitly public nature, Twitter becomes a double-sided platform that can be utilized in different ways depending on the amount of censorship a user decides on.\n\nPersonal branding focuses on \"self-packaging,\" where \"success is not determined by individuals' internal sets of skills, motivations, and interests but, rather, by how effectively they are…branded\"; it is more about self-promotion rather than true self-expression. The difference between the two is that self-promotion is deliberately intentional in all aspects because the individual is purposely shaping their image or persona, while self-expression can even be a byproduct of promotion.\n\nAside from professional aspirations, personal branding can also be used on personal-level social networks to flare popularity. The online self is used as a marketing and promotional tool to brand an individual as a type of person; success on the virtual platforms then becomes \"online social value [that could transform] to real rewards in the offline world.\" A prominent example of a self-made self-branded social media icon is Tila Tequila, who rose to prominence in 2006 on the Myspace network, gaining more than 1.5 million friends, through expertly marketing her personal brand.\n\nAs social media has become a vehicle for self-branding, these moguls have begun to situate the maintenance of their online brand as a job, which brings about new ways to think about work and labor The logic of online sites and the presence of feedback means that one's online presence is viewed by others using the same rubric to judge brands: evaluation, ranking, and judgment. Thus, social media network sites serve as complex, technologically mediated venues for the branding of the self.\n\nPersonal branding offers promises of increased success in the business world. Thousands of self-help books, programs, personal coaches, and articles exist to help individuals learn to self-brand. These strategies emphasize authenticity but framed as becoming \"'more of who you are' as well as who 'you were meant to be.'\n\nThe other side of these 'strategies for success' is that this is very subtle self-commodification. Because personal branding is basically pointing out, and in some cases, glorifying, certain positive characteristics of an individual, it is not unlike traditional branding of products and companies. This puts individuals in the place of products, in which their efforts to appear more human are subverted.\n\nThis possibility is exploited by celebrities and politicians, as \"marketing individual personalities as products\" is an effective way to gain millions of fans not just online but in real life as well. For celebrities of all types, online personas are their brands. Public relations for Justin Bieber and Barack Obama alike can easily control the \"brand\" and maximize exposure and profitability.\n\nOn the other hand, personal branding may afford potential employers the opportunity to more accurately judge a candidate's abilities and cultural suitability, since blogs, profiles, websites, etc., are pieces of work that can be evaluated.\n\nPersonal branding involves the practice of self-disclosure, and this transparency is part of what Foucault would call \"the proper care of the self\". In this sense, disclosure refers to the details of one's everyday life for other's consumption, while transparency is the effect of this kind of disclosure. Transparency essentially works to give viewers a complete view of one's authentic self.\n\nDigitally aided disclosure, which involves building a self-brand on a social network site, relies on traditional discourses of the authentic self as one that is transparent, without artifice, and open to others. Authenticity is viewed as both residing inside the self and is also demonstrated by allowing the outside world access to one's inner self. It is interesting to think about the idea of authenticity with disclosure, and the freedom social networks allow in disclosing an inauthentic self. All the while, these posting are forming a digital archive of the self, through which a brand could be crafted by others. An example of this is Carly Fleishmann, whose Twitter posting created an iconicity and brand without her ever speaking out loud. Another example of a figure who rose to prominence through this disclosure is Ingrid Nilsen, who posted a video on YouTube coming out as lesbian and subsequently took off as a YouTube star. Through disclosure individuals are able to go through the process of personal branding.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "286012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286012", "title": "Platonic love", "text": "Platonic love\n\nPlatonic love (often lower-cased as platonic) is a term used for a type of love, or close relationship that is non-sexual. Its symbol would be the white rose. It is named after Greek philosopher Plato, though the philosopher never used the term himself. Platonic love as devised by Plato concerns rising through levels of closeness to wisdom and true beauty from carnal attraction to individual bodies to attraction to souls, and eventually, union with the truth. This is the ancient, philosophical interpretation. Platonic love is often contrasted with romantic love.\n\nPlatonic love is examined in Plato's dialogue, the \"Symposium\", which has as its topic the subject of love or Eros generally. It explains the possibilities of how the feeling of love began and how it has evolved—both sexually and non-sexually. Of particular importance is the speech of Socrates, who attributes to the prophetess Diotima an idea of platonic love as a means of ascent to contemplation of the divine. The step of this ascent is known as the \"Ladder of Love\". For Diotima, and for Plato generally, the most correct use of love of human beings is to direct one's mind to love of divinity. Socrates defines love based on separate classifications of pregnancy (to bear offspring); pregnancy of the body, pregnancy of the soul, and direct connection to Being. Pregnancy of the body results in human children. Pregnancy of the soul, the next step in the process, produces \"virtue\" – which is the soul (truth) translating itself into material form. \"[...] virtue for the Greeks means self-sameness [...] in Plato's terms, Being or idea.\"(106) \n\nIn short, with genuine platonic love, the beautiful or lovely other person inspires the mind and the soul and directs one's attention to spiritual things. Pausanias, in Plato's \"Symposium\" (181b–182a), explained two types of love or Eros—Vulgar Eros or earthly love and Divine Eros or divine love. Vulgar Eros is nothing but mere material attraction towards a beautiful body for physical pleasure and reproduction. Divine Eros begins the journey from physical attraction, i.e. attraction towards beautiful form or body but transcends gradually to love for Supreme Beauty. This concept of Divine Eros is later transformed into the term platonic love. Vulgar Eros and Divine Eros are both connected and part of the same continuous process of pursuing totality of being itself, with the purpose of mending human nature, eventually reaching a point of unity where there is no longer an aspiration to change. \"Eros is [...] a moment of transcendence [...] in so far as the other can never be possessed without being annihilated in its status as the other, at which point both desire and transcendence would cease [...] (84) \n\nIn the \"Symposium\", Eros is discussed as a Greek god – more specifically, the king of the gods, with each guest of the party giving a eulogy in praise of Eros. This view of Eros is different from how a modern person would interpret it. Most modern people would think of Eros as a concept rather than a god. This is an example of cultural relativity, because the modern interpretation of the term is different from the ancient Greek interpretation.\"So this is how I assert that Eros is the oldest, most honorable, and most competent of the gods with regard to the acquisition of virtue and happiness by human beings both when living and dead.\" (180c, 8) – Plato's quoting of Phaedrus' eulogy on Eros \n\nVirtue, according to Greek philosophy, is the concept of how closely reality and material form equates with the ideal, true essence of an idea, such as beauty. Virtue is the result of pregnancy of the soul. This definition varies considerably from the modern English interpretation of the term, where virtue equates to that which is good, positive, or benevolent. This can be seen as a form of linguistic relativity.\n\nSome modern authors perception of the terms \"virtue\" and \"good\" as they are translated into English from the \"Symposium\" are a good indicator of this misunderstanding. In the following quote, the author simplifies the idea of virtue as simply what is \"good\".\"[...] what is good is beautiful, and what is beautiful is good [...]\" \n\nThe Ladder of Love is named as such because it relates each step toward Being itself as consecutive rungs of a ladder. Each step closer to the truth further distances love from beauty of the body toward love that is more focused on wisdom and the essence of beauty.\n\nThe ladder starts with carnal attraction of body for body, progressing to a love for body and soul. Eventually, in time, with consequent steps up the ladder, the idea of beauty is eventually no longer connected with a body, but entirely united with Being itself.\"[...] decent human beings must be gratified, as well as those that are not as yet decent, so that they might become more decent; and the love of the decent must be preserved.\" (187d, 17) - Eryximachus' \"completion\" of Pausanias' speech on Eros \n\nPlato's \"Symposium\" defines two extremes in the process of platonic love; the entirely carnal and the entirely ethereal. These two extremes of love are seen by the Greeks in terms of tragedy and comedy. According to Diotima in her discussion with Socrates, for anyone to achieve the final rung in the Ladder of Love, they would essentially transcend the body and rise to immortality - gaining direct access to Being. Such a form of love is impossible for a mortal to achieve.\n\nWhat Plato describes as \"pregnancy of the body\" is entirely carnal and seeks pleasure and beauty in bodily form only. This is the type of love, that, according to Socrates, is practiced by animals.\"Now, if both these portraits of love, the tragic and the comic, are exaggerations, then we could say that the genuine portrayal of Platonic love is the one that lies between them. The love described as the one practiced by those who are pregnant according to the soul, who partake of both the realm of beings and the realm of Being, who grasp Being indirectly, through the mediation of beings, would be a love that Socrates could practice.\" \n\nDiotima considers the carnal limitation of human beings to the pregnancy of the body to be a form of tragedy, as it separates someone from the pursuit of truth. One would be forever limited to beauty of the body, never being able to access the true essence of beauty.\n\nDiotima considers the idea of a mortal having direct access to Being to be a comic situation simply because of the impossibility of it. The offspring of true virtue would essentially lead to a mortal achieving immortality.\n\nIn the Middle Ages arose a new interest in Plato, his philosophy and his view of love. This was caused by Georgios Gemistos Plethon during the Councils of Ferrara and Firenze in 1438-1439. Later in 1469, Marsilio Ficino put forward a theory of neo-platonic love in which he defines love as a personal ability of an individual which guides their soul towards cosmic processes and lofty spiritual goals and heavenly ideas (\"De Amore\", Les Belles Lettres, 2012). The first use of the modern sense of platonic love is taken as an invention of Ficino in one of his letters.\n\nThough Plato's discussions of love originally centered on relationships which were sexual between members of the same sex, scholar Todd Reeser studies how the meaning of platonic love in Plato's original sense underwent a transformation during the Renaissance, leading to the contemporary sense of nonsexual heterosexual love.\n\nThe English term dates back to William Davenant's \"The Platonic Lovers\" (performed in 1635); a critique of the philosophy of platonic love which was popular at Charles I's court. It is derived from the concept in Plato's \"Symposium\" of the love of the idea of good which lies at the root of all virtue and truth. For a brief period, Platonic love was a fashionable subject at the English royal court, especially in the circle around Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I. Platonic love was the theme of some of the courtly masques performed in the Caroline era—though the fashion soon waned under pressures of social and political change.\n\nThroughout these eras platonic love slowly was categorized into different subsections, which were: Eros, Philia, Storge, Agape, Ludus, Pragma, Philautia. Eros is a sexual or passionate love, or a modern perspective of romantic love. Philia is the type of love that is directed towards friendship or goodwill, often is met with mutual benefits that can also can be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust. Storge is the type of love that is found between parents and children, and this is often a unilateral love. Agape is the universal love, that can consist of the love for strangers, nature, or god. Ludus is a playful and uncommitted love, this is focused for fun and sometimes as a conquest with no strings attached. Pragma is the type of love that is founded on duty and reason, and one's longer term interests. Philautia is self-love and this can be healthy or unhealthy; which can be unhealthy if you are hubris if placed ahead of gods, and it can be healthy if its used to build self esteem and confidence. These different forms of love can be mistaken as any of the listed different loves. There is a type of porosity that allows love to filter through one type and into the next, although for Plato love is to be of the beautiful and good things. This is due to the ownership of beautiful and good things equates into happiness. All beautiful and good things sit below truth and wisdom, for everyone looks to truthful and wise people as the truly beautiful for the effort of being considered beautifully good, and this is exactly why Plato suggests that love is not a god but rather a philosopher.\n\n\"Platonic love in its modern popular sense is an affectionate relationship into which the sexual element does not enter, especially in cases where one might easily assume otherwise.\" \"Platonic lovers function to underscore a supportive role where the friend sees her or his duty as the provision of advice, encouragement, and comfort to the other person [...] and do not entail exclusivity\"\n\n90% of our closest relationship will be of a platonic nature, but when there is an insistence on labelling the relationship as platonic love the terminology itself may create discourse within one's relationships. Notably romantic relationships where a bond of love has been established.\n\nOne of the complications of platonic love lies within the persistence of the use of the title itself \"platonic love\" versus the use of \"friend\". It is the use of the word love that directs us towards a deeper relationship than the scope of a normal friendship.\n\nSecondly, a study by Hause and Messman states: \"The most popular reasons for retaining a platonic relationship of the opposite sex (or sex of attraction) was to safeguard a relationship, followed by not attracted, network disapproval, third party, risk aversion, and time out.\" This points to the fact that the title of platonic love in most cases is actually a title-holder to avoid sexual interaction between knowing and consenting friends, with mutual or singular sexual interest and/or tension existing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26161523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26161523", "title": "RapeLay", "text": "RapeLay\n\n\"RapeLay\" is played from the perspective of a \"chikan\" named Masaya Kimura, who stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiryuu family (a mother and her two daughters).\n\nIn story mode, the player rapes the three women in the order of Manaka, Yuuko, and Aoi. The player starts off in the train station. Upon entering the train, the main character gropes the woman the main character is currently in the train with. After the main character finishes raping all three women, the players has the option of free play scenes.\n\nAfter being caught by Aoi groping a woman on a subway train, Masaya Kimura is arrested by authorities. On the morning of the next day, Aoi and her young sister Manaka help their mother Yuuko find a wallet she lost around their home while talking about the incident the previous day. Unknown to them, Kimura secretly eavesdrops on their conversation while waiting outside their house. It is revealed here that his father, a well known influential/important politician, managed to release him from custody. When Kimura discovers that Yuuko is widowed, he decided to put his revenge plan into action.\n\nKimura first starts with the youngest, Manaka. Following her to the subway, he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, he traps her in a public bathroom and rapes her, taking pictures of her semen-covered naked body with his mobile phone. Kimura instructs Manaka to feign sickness the next day and stay in her room.\n\nThe next day he follows Yuuko, the mother, from her house to the train station where he fondles her on the train. Kimura follows her to the city park. As per his plan, Manaka calls Yuuko on her mobile phone, telling her that she is in the bushes at the park. When Yuuko walks towards the bushes, Kimura ambushes her, ties her up and rapes her in the park. He takes pictures of her semen-covered naked body before handing her over to his gang of henchmen on the side, who detain her for him.\n\nThe third day he follows Aoi, the eldest daughter, to the train station and shows her the photo of her tied up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, she asks Kimura why he is doing this, at which point she remembers he is the same groper whom she reported for molesting a woman. Getting in a vehicle, Kimura and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and takes photos after withdrawing.\n\nAfter having his way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He considers this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind and that they are all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.\n\nThe game is open-ended and there are two possible outcomes to the game where the main character dies.\n\n\n\nCritics of violent game imagery, such as British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz, have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated, and Yoshimura Tei was arrested and charged with obscenity. \"RapeLay\" in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as being one of the rape games purchasable on Amazon.com, despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from its website. Equality Now followed up on the game, urging activists to write to Illusion and then-Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the 1985 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In May 2009, these actions culminated in the restriction of the sale and production of \"RapeLay\" by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), an independent Japanese ratings organization for adult games, making the purchase of the game impossible.\n\nThe distribution of \"RapeLay\" has been banned in Australia due to a campaign run by Women's Forum Australia, under the directorship of Melinda Tankard Reist. Former Minister for Broadband Stephen Conroy wanted Google Australia to censor search results for downloads of the game, but this did not occur. The game is also the only one to be effectively banned in Argentina. Citing \"RapeLay\" as an example, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, in his concurring opinion vis-à-vis the case \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\" wrote, \"It...appears that there is no antisocial theme too base for some in the video-game industry to exploit.\"\n\nArticles in defence have also been written, many noting that rape is a lesser crime compared to murder, yet there are thousands of legal video games in which the goal is to kill enemies. Illusion's response to the controversy was one of bewilderment and a reiteration that the game passed Japanese laws and is not sold outside Japan. Illusion later removed references to the game from their website and ceased distribution of the game, citing concerns over the impact on the industry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42132", "title": "Rastafari", "text": "Rastafari\n\nRastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. Scholars of religion and related fields have classified it as both a new religious movement and a social movement. There is no centralized authority in control of the movement and much heterogeneity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRastas refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible, as \"Rastalogy\". Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God—referred to as Jah—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses its attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the Promised Land of \"Zion\". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as \"livity\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the smoking of cannabis, the latter being regarded as a sacrament with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to ital dietary requirements, twisting their hair into dreadlocks, and following patriarchal gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised Afro-Jamaican communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant British colonial culture. It was influenced by both Ethiopianism and the Back-to-Africa movement promoted by black nationalist figures like Marcus Garvey. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's counter-cultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired reggae musicians like Bob Marley. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement has survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"Mansions of Rastafari\", the most prominent of which are the Nyahbinghi, Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. The majority of practitioners are of black African descent, although a minority come from other racial groups.\n\nScholars of religion have categorised Rastafari as a new religious movement, a new social movement, or as a social movement. The scholar of religion Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a sect, and the sociologist Ernest Cashmore as a cult, while scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a revitalization movement. \nAlthough Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of creolization, a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.\nEdmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a world religion, not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.\nMany Rastas themselves, however, do not regard it as a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\". In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that—for the purposes of the Race Relations Act 1976—Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion. \n\nThe term \"Rastafari\" derives from the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie; the term \"Ras\" means a duke or prince, while \"Tafari Makonen\" was his name. It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name. Many commentators—including some academic sources—refer to the movement as \"Rastafarianism\". This term has also been used by some practitioners. However, \"Rastafarianism\" is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of \"isms\" or \"ians\" (which they see as a typical part of \"Babylon\" culture), dislike being labelled as an \"ism\" or \"ian\" themselves. Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as \"insensitive\".\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement. It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.\n\nRastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as \"Rastalogy\". The scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds described Rastafari as having \"a fairly cohesive worldview\"; however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were \"fluid and open to interpretation\". Because it has no systematic theology or highly developed institutions, the sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke stated that it was \"extremely difficult to generalise\" about Rastas and their beliefs. Based on his research in Ghana, the scholar of religion Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of \"Rasta spiritualities\"\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\". The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history. Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a catechism or creed within the movement.\n\nEmphasis is placed on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice. No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are orthodox and which are heterodox. The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma \"is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma\", according to Clarke.\n\nRastafari belief is deeply influenced by Judeo-Christian religion. It accords the Bible a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book, and adopts a literalist interpretation of its contents. Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black history and their place as God's favoured people. They believe that the Bible was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. For Rastas, the Bible is therefore viewed as the key to understanding the past and the present and for predicting the future. It is also regarded as a source book from which they can form their religious practices. The Bible's final book, the Book of Revelation, is widely regarded as the most important part for Rastas, having a particular significance for their situation.\n\nHowever, Rastas also believe that the true meaning of the Bible has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those who wanted to deny black Africans their history. They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings. They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the \"book within\". As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history. Common texts used for this purpose include Leonard Howell's 1935 work \"The Promised Key\", Robert Athlyi Rogers' 1924 book \"Holy Piby\", and Fitz Balintine Pettersburg 1920s work, the \"Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy\".\n\nRastafari are monotheists, worshiping a singular God whom they call Jah. Rastas view Jah in the form of the Holy Trinity – Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. The term \"Jah\" is a shortened version of \"Jehovah\", the name of God in English translations of the Old Testament.\n\nAs well as regarding Jah as a deity, Rastas also believe that Jah is inherent within each human individual. This belief is reflected in the aphorism, often cited by Rastas, that \"God is man and man is God\". Due to the view that God exists within everyone, Rastas believe that all members of the religion are intrinsically connected, and thereby regard statements like \"you and I\" as being insignificant.\nAs a result, Rastas speak of \"knowing\" Jah, rather than simply \"believing\" in him. In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces mysticism. In believing that human beings have an inner divinity within themselves, Rastas help to cultivate a bastion against the uncertainty and insecurity that exists within society and societal institutions.\n\nJesus of Nazareth is an important figure in Rastafari. However, practitioners reject the traditional depiction of Jesus present in Christianity, particularly the depiction of him as a white European, believing that this is a perversion of the truth. They believe that Jesus was a black African and that he was a Rasta. Christianity is treated with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors and the oppressed cannot share the same God, with many Rastas taking the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually the Devil. Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers, and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora, often referring to it as having perpetrated \"mental enslavement\". One recurring saying among Rastafari is that \"The Pope is Satan\". Jesus is given particular prominence among a Rastafari denomination known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rastas belonging to this group refer to Jesus as Yahshua and Yesus Kritos, and believe that his second coming is imminent. Accordingly, they do not share the view of other Rastas that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus.\n\nFrom Rastafari's origins, the religion was intrinsically linked with Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, who ruled as Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. He remains the central symbolic figure in Rastafari ideology, and although all Rastas hold him in esteem, precise interpretations of his identity differ. The Makonnen dynasty, of which Haile Selassie was a member, claimed descent from the Biblical figures Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, a belief that many Rastas share. However, historians agree that this alleged \"Solomonic\" lineage was broken multiple times in history, and probably a 13th-century invented tradition to justify Yekuno Amlak's new reign.\n\nUnderstandings of how Haile Selassie relates to Jesus differ among Rastas. Many, although not all, view the Ethiopian king as Second Coming of Jesus. In this, Haile Selassie is also believed to be the messiah predicted in the Biblical Old Testament, and as the manifestation of God in human form, and therefore \"the living God\". Some perceive him as part of a Trinity, alongside God as Creator and the Holy Spirit, which is sometimes referred to among Rastas as \"the Breath within the temple\". Among those Rastas claiming a link between the two figures, some point to the belief that both Jesus and Haile Selassie were descendants from the royal line of David. Rastas also cite their interpretation of chapter 19 in the Book of Revelation. \n\nOther Rastas see Selassie as embodying Jesus' teachings and essence but not being the reincarnated Jesus himself. From this perspective, Haile Selassie is perceived as a messenger or emissary of God rather than a manifestation of God himself. This attitude may be more pervasive among Rastas living in Africa itself, who are more familiar with the realities of the continent's political problems. Rastas holding to this view sometimes regard the deification of Haile Selassie as naïve or ignorant; there are various Rastas who went from believing that Haile Selassie was both God incarnate and the Second Coming of Jesus to seeing him as something distinct.\nOn being crowned, Haile Selassie was given the title of \"King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\". Rastas use this title for Haile Selassie alongside others, such as \"Almighty God\", \"Judge and Avenger\", \"King Alpha and Queen Omega\", \"Returned Messiah\", \"Elect of God\", and \"Elect of Himself\". Rastas also view Haile Selassie as a symbol of their positive affirmation of Africa as a source of spiritual and cultural heritage.\n\nDuring the 1960s, many Jamaican Rastas professed the belief that Haile Selassie would never die. The 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie by the military Derg and his subsequent death in 1975 resulted in a crisis of faith for many Rastas. Some practitioners left the movement altogether. Others remained, and developed new strategies for dealing with the news. Some Rastas believed that Selassie did not really die and that claims to the contrary were Western misinformation. To bolster their argument, they pointed to the fact that no corpse had been produced; in reality, Haile Selassie's body had been buried beneath a toilet in his palace, remaining undiscovered there until 1992. To support their claim of his continued survival, some Rastas claimed that Selassie was now living under a new name, Abba Keddus or Abba Keddus Keddus Keddus. Another perspective within Rastafari acknowledged that Haile Selassie's body had perished, but claimed that his inner essence survived as a spiritual force. A third response within the Rastafari community was that Selassie's death was inconsequential as he had only been a \"personification\" of Jah rather than Jah himself.\n\nDuring his life, Selassie described himself as a devout Christian.\nIn a 1967 interview when a Canadian interviewer mentioned the Rastafari belief that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, he responded by saying: \"I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity.\" His grandson Ermias Sahle Selassie has said that there is \"no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement\". For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God. However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.\n\nAccording to Clarke, Rastafari is \"concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people\". The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica, while at the same time making a determined effort to create an identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage. Rastas equate blackness with the African continent and thus endorse a form of Pan-Africanism. Practitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient Israelites—God's chosen people in the Old Testament—and believe that black Africans or Rastas are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.\nRastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed. In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of feelings of inferiority.\n\nRastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in \"Babylon\", a term applied to Western society. For Rastas, European colonialism and global capitalism are regarded as manifestations of Babylon, while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents. The term \"Babylon\" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, Babylon is the Mesopotamian city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE. In the New Testament, \"Babylon\" is used as a euphemism for the Roman Empire, which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians. Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the Atlantic slave trade which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora. Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade. Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.\n\nFor Rastas, Babylon is regarded as the ultimate evil. Rastas regard the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering, with the term \"suffering\" having a significant place in Rasta discourse. Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism \"Chant down Babylon\". Practitioners are often critical of Western resource extraction from Africa, seeing it as a form of exploitation akin to the Atlantic Slave Trade. Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, again regarding this as a Babylonian development. Rastas often expect white-dominated society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens it is seen as confirmation of the correctness of their faith, thus strengthening their convictions.\nRastas view \"Zion\" as an ideal to which they aspire. As with \"Babylon\", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised Jerusalem, regarded as the City of God. Rastas use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse. In doing so, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon. During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa. To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and United Nations to oversee this resettlement process. Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent. Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.\n\nBy the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas. This change in view was influenced by observation of the 1983-1985 famine in Ethiopia. Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent. The term \"liberation before repatriation\" began to be used within the movement. Some Rastas seek to transform Western society so that they may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa. There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa. Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of \"Ethiopia\"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within \"Ethiopia\".\n\nThere is no uniform Rasta view on race. Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's chosen people, meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility. This is similar to beliefs in Judaism. Influenced by Garvey, many Rastas endorse black supremacy, believing the black African race to be superior to other racial groups. This has opened the religion up to accusations of racism from its critics, including black Jamaicans. Cashmore noted that there was an \"implicit potential\" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not \"intrinsic\" to the religion. Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas. Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European could ever be a legitimate Rasta, while others believe that an \"African\" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African \"attitude\" or \"spirit\".\n\nRastafari has been characterised as a millenarianist movement, for it espouses the idea that the present age will come to an apocalyptic end. With Babylon destroyed, Rastas believe that humanity will be ushered into a \"new age\". In the 1980s, Rastas believed that this would happen around the year 2000. In this Day of Judgement, Babylon will be overthrown, and Rastas would be the chosen few who survive. A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through nuclear war, with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in Daniel 2: 31–32.\nIn Rasta belief, the end of this present age would be followed by a millennium of peace, justice, and happiness in Ethiopia. The righteous will live in paradise in Africa. Those who had supported Babylon will be denied access to paradise.\nThe Rasta conception of salvation has similarities with that promoted in Judaism.\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific afterlife to which human individuals go following bodily death. They believe in the possibility of eternal life, and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die. One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of reincarnation, with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.\nBarrett observed some Jamaican Rastas who believed that those Rastas who did die had not been faithful to Jah. He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.\nIn keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals, also repudiating the practice of ancestor veneration that is common among African traditional religions.\n\nMost Rastas share a pair of fundamental moral principles known as the \"two great commandments\". These are love of God and love of neighbour. Rastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\", in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws. It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level. Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and as a result have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent. Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.\n\nRastafari promotes what it regards as the restoration of black manhood, believing that men in the African diaspora have been emasculated by Babylon. Rastafari espouses patriarchal principles, and promotes the idea that women should submit to male leadership. External observers—including scholars like Cashmore and Edmonds—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men. Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men; the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided. Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by evil, and claims that they are impure during their period of menstruation. Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly; however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved toward greater gender equity. Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the Book of Leviticus, and in the writings of Paul the Apostle.\n\nRasta women usually wear clothing that covers their head and masks their body contours, in a manner akin to traditional Islamic clothing. Long skirts are usually worn rather than trousers, and women are expected to cover their head while praying. Rasta discourse legitimises this female dress code with the claim that it is necessary to prevent women attracting men; it also endorses this female dress code as an antidote to the sexual objectification of women in Babylon. Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose. Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies. This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari was not monogamous. Rasta men are permitted to have multiple female sex partners, while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner. Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies, although there are many Rastas who are legally married. Rasta men refer to their female partners as \"queens\", or \"empresses\", while the males in these relationships are known as \"kingmen\". Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children, with reproduction being encouraged. The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood. Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at home. Rastafari typically rejects feminism, although since the 1970s there have been increasing numbers of Rasta women calling for greater gender equity within the Rastafari movement. Clarke encountered Rasta women in Britain who expressed feminist sentiment and criticised sexism within the religion, while the scholar Terisa E. Turner encountered black feminists in Kenya who were appropriating Rastafari and redefining its content to suit their political agenda. Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.\n\nBoth contraception and abortion are usually censured by Rastas, and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate. Rastas also typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural; this attitude derives from references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible. In the 1960s, the scholar Sheila Kitzinger suggested that this horror of homosexuality \"may be an indication of a heterosexuality which is not markedly pronounced\" among Jamaican practitioners. The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested that there were likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these attitudes. Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.\n\nSome Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs. In Jamaica, Rastas do not typically vote and derogatorily dismiss politics as \"politricks\". Similarly, some Ghanaian Rastas were reported as refusing to vote in the 2000 general election, believing that salvation would only come through livity, not political activity. The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the political left that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo. Most of these Jamaican practitioners have rejected both capitalism and socialism as models of economic development. Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter Rocky Dawuni for instance has been involved in campaigns promoting social justice, environmental justice, and democratic elections. In the example of Grenada, many Rastas joined the People's Revolutionary Government which was formed in 1979, although Marxist-Leninist factions later turned against them.\n\nThe cultural and religious practices of Rastafari are referred to as \"livity\" by Rastas.\nRastafari has no professional priesthood, with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity. There are individuals who are regarded as elders within the community. This is an honorific title bestowed upon those who have attained a good reputation among Rastas because of their exemplary conduct. Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities among Rastafari. Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.\n\nThe term \"grounding\" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners. Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder. The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban those who contravene the rules that they set forth. The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred. Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry. Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked. Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded. Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.\n\nOne of the central activities that takes place at groundings is \"reasoning\". This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events. These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments that are presented. Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream. Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion. Cashmore observed that in England, Rastas arrived and left throughout the reasoning session. In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.\n\nRastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers. Barrett suggested that the most common example had \"all the structure of a classical ritual prayer\". This prayer involves supplication of God, the supplication for the hungry, sick, and infants, calls for the destruction of the Rastas' enemies, and then closes with statements of adoration.\n\nThe largest groundings were known as \"groundations\" or \"grounations\" in the 1950s, although were subsequently re-termed \"Nyabinghi Issemblies\". The term Nyabinghi is adopted from the name of a mythical African queen. Several dates are often selected for Nyabinghi Issemblies, particularly those associated with Ethiopia and Haile Selassie. These include Ethiopian Christmas (7 January), the day on which Haile Selassie visited Jamaica (21 April), Selassie's birthday (23 July), Ethiopian New Year (11 September), Selassie's coronation day (2 November). Some Rastas also organise Nyabinghi Issemblies to mark Jamaica's Emancipation Day (1 August) and Marcus Garvey's birthday (17 August).\n\nNyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as \"temples\" or \"tabernacles\"—which are specifically constructed for the purpose. Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders to do so, and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event. The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days. During the daytime, those Rastas attending the event engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires.\nNyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries. They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging. They also help to confirm Rastas' convictions in the veracity of Rastafari teaching.\n\nClarke stated that the \"principle ritual\" of Rastafari was the smoking of ganja, or cannabis. Among the names that Rastas give to the plant are \"callie\", \"Iley\", \"the herb\", \"the grass\", and \"the weed\". When smoked in ritual contexts, Rastas often refer to it as \"the holy herb\". In addition to smoking it, Rastas also ingest cannabis in a tea, as a spice in cooking, and as an ingredient in medicine.\nCannabis is usually smoked during groundings, although some Rastas smoke it almost all of the time. Others have criticised this practice, believing that use of the drug should be restricted to groundings.\nHowever, not all Rastas use ganja, explaining that they have already achieved a higher level of consciousness and thus do not require it.\n\nRastas argue that the use of ganja is promoted in the Bible, specifically in Genesis 1: 29, Psalms 18:8, and Revelation 22:2. Rastas portray cannabis as the supreme herb, and regard it as having healing properties. They also eulogise it for inducing feelings of \"peace and love\" in those taking it, and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows the smoker to discover their inner divinity, or \"InI consciousness\". Some Rastas express the view that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts perceived immoral practices, such as same-sex sexual relations, in society.\n\nWhen meeting in a grounding, Rastas typically remove their head gear first. Rastas most often smoke cannabis through a form of large cigarette known as a spliff. This is often rolled together while a prayer is offered to Jah; only once this is completed is the spliff then lit, enabling it to be smoked. At other times, cannabis is smoked not in a spliff but in a water pipe referred to as a \"chalice\". There are different styles of chalices used by Rastas, including kutchies, chillums, and steamers. The pipe is passed in a counter-clockwise direction around the assembled circle of Rastas.\nBy the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as \"dagga\" and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming. It is sometimes also referred to as \"the healing of the nation\", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2. There are various methods of transmission that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. One possible source was the African diasporic religion of Kumina, based on the practices of Bakongo enslaved people and indentured labourers who were brought to Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century. In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits. The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's Saint Thomas Parish, where a prominent early Rasta, Leonard Howell, lived during the period he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices.\n\nA second possible source was the use of cannabis in various Hindu rituals. Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from British India between 1834 and 1917, and brought the use of cannabis with them. One Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja. It is also possible that its adoption was also influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early twentieth century. Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.\n\nAccording to many Rastas, the illegality of cannabis in many nations is evidence of persecution of Rastafari. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth – something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want. In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon. Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis. The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.\n\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions, where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present. Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah. In performing it, Rastas also reaffirm their rejection of Babylon. Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches. Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns, but others are original Rasta creations.\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the akete, a three-drum set, which is accompanied by percussion instruments like rattles and tambourines. A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the fundeh drum. In addition, a peta drum improvises over the rhythm. The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium. During the 1950s, ska was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to the Rastafarians' social and political ideology. Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians Count Ossie and Don Drummond. Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music; he was heavily influenced by Kumina and Burru, two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans. Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica, with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting this Rasta influence. Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".\nRasta ideas began to feature in the lyrics of mento songs, such as Lord Lebby's \"Ethiopia\". \n\n1968 saw the development of reggae in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of patois. Although like calypso, reggae was a medium for social commentary, it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than had previously been present in Jamaican popular music. Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms, and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques. Songs like The Wailers' \"African Herbsman\" and \"Kaya\", and Peter Tosh's \"Legalize It\" referenced marijuana use, while tracks like The Melodians' \"Rivers of Babylon\" and Junior Byles' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced the Rastafarian belief in Babylon. Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s, coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries. Its popularity led to the emergence of \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who adopted the cultural trappings of Rastafari—such as dreadlocks and marijuana use—without sharing the religion's beliefs. Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their faith. Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism, and the two have come to be widely associated, the connection between them is often exaggerated by non-Rastas. Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music. Out of reggae came dub music; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.\n\nIn the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as \"dreadtalk\", developed among Jamaican practitioners. Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power, with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences, as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.\nRastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person. They believe that the English language is a tool of Babylon, and thus by formulating their own language are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the English language. The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish themselves from non-Rastas, for whom—according to Barrett—Rasta rhetoric can be \"meaningless babbling\".\nWhen greeting one another, Rastas often say \"Peace and Love\". Rastas make wide use of the pronoun \"I\". The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine. It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being. For instance, Rastas use \"I\" in place of \"me\", \"I and I\" in place of \"we\", \"I-ceive\" in place of \"receive\", \"I-sire\" in place of \"desire\", \"I-rate\" in place of \"create\", and \"I-men\" in place of \"Amen\". Rastas refer to this process as \"InI Consciousness\" or \"Isciousness\". Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as \"Haile Selassie I\", thus indicating their belief in his divinity. Rastas also typically believe that the phonetics of a word should be linked to its meaning. For instance, Rastas often use the word \"downpression\" in place of \"oppression\" because oppression bears \"down\" on people rather than lifting them \"up\", with \"up\" being phonetically akin to the \"opp-\". Similarly, they often favour \"livicate\" over \"dedicate\" because \"ded-\" is phonetically akin to the word \"dead\".\n\nRastafarians often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold. Red, gold, and green were used in the Ethiopian flag while, prior to the development of Rastafari, Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his United Negro Improvement Association. According to Garvey, the red symbolises the blood of martyrs, the black symbolises the skin of Africans, and the green represents the vegetation of the land. Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours. The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the Jamaican flag, and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth. Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items, or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists. As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity; for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states. Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the Lion of Judah, also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.\n\nRastas seek to produce food \"naturally\", eating what they call ital, or \"natural\" food. This is often produced organically, and locally. Most Rastas adhere to the dietary laws outlined in the Old Testament's Book of Leviticus, and thus avoid eating pork or crustaceans. Other Rastas remain totally vegetarian, and also avoid the addition of any additives, including sugar and salt, to their food. Rasta dietary practices have come under ridicule from non-Rastas; in Ghana for example, where food traditionally includes a high meat content, the Rastas' emphasis on vegetable produce has led to the humorous comment from other Ghanaians that Rastas \"eat like sheep and goats\". In Jamaica, Rasta practitioners have commercialised ital food, for instance by selling fruit juices prepared according to Rasta custom.\n\nRastafarians typically avoid food produced by non-Rastas or from unknown sources. Rasta men also refuse to eat food prepared by a woman while she was menstruating. They also avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine.\n\nThrough their use of language, dress, dreaded hair, and lifestyle Rastas seek to draw a clear boundary between themselves and non-Rastas. One of the \"distinguishing mark[s] of the movement\" is the formation of hair into dreadlocks. The formation of dreadlocks is Biblically inspired, legitimised by reference to the Book of Numbers (6: 5–6). They are regarded as marking a covenant that the Rastas have made with God, and are also regarded as a symbol of strength linked to the hair of the Biblical figure of Samson. Sometimes this dreadlocked hair is then shaped and styled, often inspired by a lion's mane symbolising Haile Selassie, who is regarded as \"the Conquering Lion of Judah\". For Rastas, the wearing of dreads is a symbolic rejection of Babylon and a refusal to conform to its norms and standards regarding grooming aesthetics. They also reflect a commitment to the Rasta idea of 'naturalness'. Rastas are often critical of black people who straighten their hair, believing that it is an attempt to imitate white European hair and thus reflects alienation from a person's African identity.\n\nThere are Rastas who do not wear their hair in dreadlocks; within the religion they are often termed \"cleanface\" Rastas. Some Rastas have also joined the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Christian organisation to which Haile Selassie belonged, and these individuals are required to not wear their hair in locks by the Church. Many Rastas also grow their beards long. In reference to Rasta hairstyles, Rastas often refer to non-Rastas as \"baldheads\", while those who are new to Rastafari and who have only just started to grow their hair into dreads are known as \"nubbies\". Members of the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastas conceal their dreadlocks within turbans. The tam headdress worn by many Rastas is coloured green, red, black, and yellow to symbolise allegiance and identification with Ethiopia.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Rastafari movement in the 1930s, adherents typically grew beards and tall hair, perhaps in imitation of Haile Selassie. The wearing of hair as dreadlocks then emerged as a Rasta practice in the 1940s. Within the oral culture of the movement, there are various different claims as to how this practice was adopted. One claim is that it was adopted in imitation of certain African nations, such as the Maasai, Somalis, or Oromo, or that it was inspired by the hairstyles worn by some of those involved in the anti-colonialist Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya. An alternative explanation is that it was inspired by the hairstyles of the Hindu sadhus.\n\nIt has been suggested (e.g., Campbell 1985) that the first Rasta locks were copied from Kenya in 1953, when images of the independence struggle of the feared \"Mau Mau\" insurgents, who grew their \"dreaded locks\" while hiding in the mountains, appeared in newsreels and other publications that reached Jamaica. However, a more recent study by Barry Chevannes has traced the first hairlocked Rastas to a subgroup first appearing in 1949, known as Youth Black Faith.\nThe wearing of dreadlocks has faced opposition from other sectors of society; in Jamaica during the mid-20th century, teachers and police officers used to cut off the dreads of Rastas. In the United States, several public schools and workplaces have lost lawsuits as the result of banning locks. Safeway is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their Lafayette, Louisiana school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights. More recently, in 2009, a group of Rastafari settled a federal lawsuit with the Grand Central Partnership in New York City, allowing them to wear their locks in neat ponytails, rather than be forced to \"painfully tuck in their long hair\" in their uniform caps. Dreadlocks remain socially stigmatised in many societies; in Ghana for example, they are often associated with the homeless mentally ill, with such associations of marginality extending onto Ghanaian Rastas.\n\nDreadlocks and Rastafari-inspired clothing have also been worn for aesthetic reasons by non-Rastas. For instance, many reggae musicians who do not adhere to the Rastafari religion wear their hair in dreads. Many non-Rastafari of African descent wear locks as an expression of pride in their ethnic identity, or simply as a hairstyle, and take a less purist approach to developing and grooming them. The wearing of dreads also has spread among people of other ethnicities. Locks worn for stylish reasons are sometimes referred to as \"bathroom locks\", to distinguish them from the kind that are purely natural. Rastafari purists also sometimes refer to such dreadlocked individuals as \"wolves\", as in \"a wolf in sheep's clothing\", especially when they are seen as trouble-makers who might potentially discredit or infiltrate Rastafari. The wearing of dreadlocks has also contributed to the negative view of Rastafari held by many non-Rastas, who regard it as wild and unattractive.\n\nThe Rastafari movement developed out of the legacy of the Atlantic slave trade, in which over ten million Africans were enslaved and transported from Africa to the Americas between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations. Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica. On the island, the enslaved Africans were divided into a stratified system, with field workers on the lowest rung and house servants above them. In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society, with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century, and those of African descent being treated as second-class citizens. With slavery abolished, formerly enslaved Africans and Afro-Jamaicans became free peasants. In the three decades after emancipation, the Free Village system proliferated across Jamaica as non-conformist missionaries, particularly Baptist, purchased land from the large owners and sold it as smaller plots to former slaves.\n\nMany Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860–61. They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees. Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian. The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures. Increasing numbers of Pentecostal missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s. They provided a way for black Jamaicans—who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions—to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.\n\nAccording to the scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\", while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Both Ethiopianism and the Back to Africa ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\". These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century. \n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa. In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher Edward Wilmot Blyden began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions. Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context, and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves. The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the State of Israel in 1948 as a nation-state for the Jewish diaspora to return to.\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages. For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole. Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.\n\nGarvey supported the idea of global racial separatism and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate \"en masse\" back to Africa. His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like W. E. B. Du Bois. He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores. As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified. Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\". Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\" Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives, with many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet. According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\", while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.\n\nEmperor Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Christian clergymen, among them Leonard Percival Howell, Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert, Henry Archibald Dunkley, and Hinds, claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2–5; 19:16), the Book of Daniel (7:3), and the Book of Psalms (68:31). These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica. Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.\n\nOver the following years, a number of street preachers—most notably Leonard Howell, Archibald Dunkley, Robert Hinds, and Joseph Hibbert—began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus. Howell has been described as the \"First Rasta\", and the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement. Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to George V, King of Great Britain and Ireland. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment. Following his release, Howell established the Ethiopian Salvation Society and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient. Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years. On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.\n\nIn 1936, Italy invaded and occupied Ethiopia, with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause. In 1937, Selassie then created the Ethiopian World Federation, which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938. In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned. For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11–19).\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society. For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities. Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon. Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession. During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged. The vanguard of this was the House of Youth Black Faith, a group whose members were largely based in West Kingston.\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957. In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in Back-o-Wall, Kingston. Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie. Later that year they tried again in Spanish Town. The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica. According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society. In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the African Reform Church, Claudius Henry, sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government. Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence. Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport. The event was the high point for many of the religion's members. Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of routinization, with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the Rastafarian Movement Association's \"Rasta Voice\". The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways. During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians. The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\". Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like Leahcim Semaj, who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change. Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him, many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic Walter Rodney, who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet \"Groundings\". Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based Black Power movement. After Black Power declined following the deaths of Malcolm X, Michael X, and George Jackson, Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth. \nIn the mid-1970s, the international popularity of reggae exploded. The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who—according to Cashmore—\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\". The popularity of reggae led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but whom did not share its belief system. Many Rastas were angered by these developments, believing that the popularity of reggae had commercialised their religion. Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s. In his desire to break from the past and move towards democratic socialism, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate. Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\", and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie. Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns, while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society. This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari, with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's cultural heritage for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and then that of Marley in 1981. During the 1980s, the number of Rastafarians in Jamaica declined, with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful than Rastafari at attracting young recruits. Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity, and two of those who did so—Judith Mowatt and Tommy Cowan—maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, during his final days. The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of dancehall, a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism. Since the mid-1990s, however, there was a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like Anthony B, Buju Banton, Luciano, Sizzla, and Capleton. From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the Jamaican Alliance Movement and the Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party, none of which have attained more than minimal electoral support.\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure, nor any single leader. Centralised and hierarchical structures are avoided by Rastas because they want to avoid replicating the formal structures of Babylon. Rastas also tend to avoid hierarchic and bureaucratic structures because of the ultra-individualistic ethos that the religion promotes with its ideas about inner divinity.\n\nThe structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like Haitian Vodou, Cuban Santeria, and Jamaica's Revival Zion. Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to fashion a pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through the establishment of the Rastafari Movement Association, which sought political mobilisation. In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in Toronto, Canada. This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.\n\nWithin Rastafari, there are distinct groups which display particular orientations. There are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the Gospel of John (14:2): as translated in the King James Bible, Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\". The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.\n\nThe House of Nyabinghi is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s. They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was a manifestation of God and the reincarnation of Jesus. The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable, and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised. Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to make any compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Bob Marley whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry. According to Cashmore, the Nyabinghi House is \"vehemently anti-white\". It is probably the largest Rastafari group.\n\nThe Bobo Ashanti sect was founded in Jamaica by Emanuel Charles Edwards through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958. The group established a commune in Bull Bay, where they were led by Edwards, who served as the group's high priest, until his 1994 death. The group hold to a highly rigid ethos. Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet. Male members of the group are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions. Women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men. The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and thus are superior to white Europeans. Bob Ashanti practitioners will often refuse to associate with white people. Members of this sect are recognisable by their attire, which include long, flowing robes and turbans. Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of Bob Ashanti Rastas have lived outside the Bull Bay commune, but continue to regard the latter as a place of pilgrimage.\nThe Twelve Tribes of Israel sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by Vernon Carrington. He regarded himself as the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet Gad, one of Jacob's twelve sons, and his followers thus refer to him as \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\". It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity in its beliefs; Barrett stated that there was \"only a thin line dividing the sect from true Christianity\". Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the messiah and only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus. The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which month in the Hebrew calendar they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function. Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential, while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day. Some Rastas regarded the Twelve Tribes as a heretical group for its views. \n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group. Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes. Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council. As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups. It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica.\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and Sunday schools. In New York, the group have established prison chaplains. In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.\n\nFulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the Internet. The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus Christ through the example set forth by Haile Selassie. The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide. They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.\nRastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size, particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society. In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation. It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance. Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\" Benard was of the view that because of its stances on capitalism, European hegemony, and white racism, Rastafari is \"easily incorporated into other nations with similar histories of European oppression\".\nAccording to sociologist of religion Peter B. Clarke, Rastafari \"helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity\".\n\nMen dominate Rastafari. In the religion's early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background. This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion. However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to meet with newly converted Rastas in order to instruct them in the fundamentals of the religion. On examining the Rasta movement in England during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that Rastas had not converted instantaneously to the belief system, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of the central importance of Haile Selassie.\nRastas often claim that—rather than converting to the religion—they were actually always a Rasta and that their actual embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this. There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.\n\nThey regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise the importance of Haile Selassie. Rastas often regard themselves as being the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\". Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth. English Rastas have for instance expressed criticism of black Britons who have not embraced the religion, stating that they have been \"brainwashed\", \"misguided by European Christianity\", and \"blinded by Babylon\".\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among the British Rastas whom he communicated with, he found that some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced Islam or no religion. Some of these British ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rasta belief failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to the industrialised and materialistic society in the UK. Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people. Cashmore found that some of British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and musical outlets insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"\nAs of the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica. The majority of these individuals were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40. Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on pilgrimage in order to \"drink from the source\".\n\nIn the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified themselves as Rastafari. Other sources estimated that in the 2000s they formed \"about 5% of the population\" of Jamaica. Jamaica's Rasta population were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority, and although most Jamaican Rastas remain Afro-Jamaican, it has also gained members from the island's Chinese, Indian, Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, mulatto, and white minorities. Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although since that point it attracted many middle-class members. By the 1980s, there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors. The majority are male. These Rastas are predominantly ex-Christians.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Rastafari ideas were spread through much of the eastern Caribbean through the growing popularity of reggae. Rasta ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views then prevailing in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent. In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had. A number of Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 New Jewel Movement and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the U.S. invasion of 1983.\n\nReggae was introduced to Cuba in the 1970s by Jamaican students. By the 1980s, underground reggae parties were being held in Havana and Santiago. Foreign Rastas who were studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with this reggae scene and helped to ground it in Rasta beliefs.\n\nSince the founding of Rastafari, some practitioners have followed through with their belief in resettlement in Africa. The West African states of Ghana and Nigeria have been particularly favoured. Ghana's status as the first African country to gain independence from European colonial rule (in 1957) made it an attractive place for members of the African diaspora to migrate to; its first post-independence President, Kwame Nkrumah, encouraged this as part of his Pan-African ethos. Among the Caribbean immigrants to arrive in the country during the 1960s were Rastafarians, while some native Ghanaians also converting to the religion. When asked as to why they chose Ghana as a new home, several of the Rasta arrivals described it as the \"gateway to the continent\"; others cited its political stability and affordability as making it ideal for settlement. For his Pan-African efforts, Nkrumah has come to be regarded as a heroic figure among many Rastas, although other Ghanaians have been critical of what they perceive as excess idolisation of the former president. The largest congregation of Ghanaian Rastas has been in southern parts of the country, around Accra, Tema, and the Cape Coast, although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana, especially in the towns of Tamale and Bolgatanga. The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native fetish priests, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society. Non-Ghanaian Rastas living in the country have nevertheless complained of social ostracism, unemployment, and legal prosecution for ganja possession; Ghanaians who were not Rastas often accuse the Rastas of being \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta community established itself in Shashamane, Ethiopia, on land made available for members of the African diaspora by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation. The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of Mengistu Haile Mariam. There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners. The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2000, although subsequently declined to around 200.\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in Nairobi, Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional Kikuyu religion.\nSeveral Rastafari orders have also been established in Zimbabwe, all of which send representatives to the Rastafari Association of Zimbabwe.\n\nAt an African Union/Caribbean Diaspora conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, several thousand Caribbean migrants settled in the United Kingdom, some of whom brought Rastafari with them. In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in Brixton, South London, and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the Notting Hill area of Northwest London. By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced. It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in Birmingham, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, and Bristol. Its spread was aided by the gang structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the rudeboy subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes. This social structure allowed for the promotion of in-gang associations and the restrictions of contacts with Babylon. British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s as a result of reggae's popularity. In that same decade it also faced increasing opposition, being regarded as a criminal sub-culture by both much of the press, and by the police, resulting in complaints of police harassment. \n\nAccording to Clarke's research, the majority are from black working-class families who practiced Pentecostalism, although a small number are from white families. Cashmore found that the majority of British Rastas were male and that most had few or no educational qualifications. He also found that around 50% of them were unemployed, and 45% employed in manual occupations; only 5% were in more skilled jobs or higher education. In 1986, there were an estimated 5000 Rastas living in the United Kingdom. Clarke believed that there were \"probably fewer members\" at this time then there had been at the start of the 1980s, with the movement declining following Marley's death. According to the 2001 United Kingdom Census there are about 5000 Rastafari living in England and Wales. Clarke described Rastafari as a numerically small but \"extremely influential\" component of black British life.\n\nRastafari was also established in various continental European countries, among them the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and France, gaining a particular foothold among black migrant populations but also attracting a growing number of white converts.\nRasta communities were also established in two French cities that had substantial black populations, Paris and Bordeaux.

They are played by hitting one spoon against the other.\n\n\nIn the United States spoons as instrument are associated with American folk music, minstrelsy, and jug and spasm bands. These musical genres make use of other everyday objects as instruments, such as the washboard and the jug. In addition to common tableware, spoons that are joined at the handle are available from musical instrument suppliers.\n\nAs percussion, spoons accompany fiddle playing and other folk sets. An example is seen in \"Midsomer Murders\" Series 6, episode 2, where Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy plays the spoons at a house party joining a fiddle player who is entertaining the guests. He uses the first technique. The guests also contribute percussion by hand clapping in time with the music.\n\nThe song \"This Old Man\" refers to a related concept, except with sheep bones (hence paddywhack) instead of spoons.\n\nIn Canada, the spoons accompany fiddle playing in Québecois and Acadian music. Also, Newfoundland and the Atlantic Provinces popularly play the spoons at family gatherings. Playing the spoons is rarely seen in Western Canada.\n\nThe spoons in Greece, as a percussion instrument are known as \"koutalakia\" (), which means also, spoon. The dancers hold the wooden koutalakia, to accompany with a variety of knocks their dance rhythms. The most of them, are very beautifully sculpted or painted.\n\nSpoons are often used in ethnic Russian music and are known as \"lozhki\" ( \"[plural]\"; \"Pronunciation\": \"[singular]\"). The use of \"spoons\" for music dating at least from the 18th century (and probably older). Typically, three or more wooden spoons are used. The convex surfaces of the bowls are struck together in different ways. For example, two spoons are held by their handles in the left hand, and the third, held in the right hand, is used to hit the two spoons in the left hand. The hit, in a sliding motion, produces a typical sound. One can also hold three spoons in the left hand and put a fourth into the bot or the pocket. A fifth spoon is then held in the right hand and used to hit the other four. Finally, one can hold the bowl of a single spoon in the left hand and hit it with another spoon. In this style, different sounds can be emitted by holding the bowl more or less tightly.\n\nThese wooden spoons are commonly used in performances of Russian folk music and sometimes even in Russian orchestras. A video of a choir performing a Russian folk song with spoon and balalaika accompaniment can be found below.\n\nKaşık (spoon) is a Turkish and Uzbekistan percussion instrument. The ones made from boxwood are particularly favoured. There are also different holding styles.\n\n\n"}

In order to do this, the star tracker must obtain an image of the stars, measure their apparent position in the reference frame of the spacecraft, and identify the stars so their position can be compared with their known absolute position from a star catalog. A star tracker may include a processor to identify stars by comparing the pattern of observed stars with the known pattern of stars in the sky.\n\nStar trackers were an important part of early long-range ballistic missiles, in the era when inertial navigation systems (INS) were not sufficiently accurate for intercontinental ranges. Selecting a guide star depends on the time, due to the Earth's rotation, and the location of the target. Generally, a selection of several bright stars would be used. For systems based solely on star tracking, some sort of recording mechanism, typically a magnetic tape, was pre-recorded with a signal that represented the angle of the star over the period of a day. At launch, the tape was forwarded to the appropriate time. During the flight, the signal on the tape was used to roughly position a telescope so it would point at the expected position of the star. At the telescope's focus was a photocell and some sort of signal-generator, typically a spinning disk known as a \"chopper\". The chopper caused the star to repeatedly appear and disappear on the photocell, producing a signal that was then smoothed to produce an alternating current output. The phase of that signal was compared to the one on the tape to produce a guidance signal. The system could be further improved by combining it with an INS, in which case additional circuitry on the INS generated the reference signal, eliminating the need for the separate tape. These \"stellar inertial\" systems were especially common from the 1950s through the 1980s, although some systems use it to this day.\n\nMany models are currently available. Star trackers, which require high sensitivity, may become confused by sunlight reflected from the spacecraft, or by exhaust gas plumes from the spacecraft thrusters (either sunlight reflection or contamination of the star tracker window). Star trackers are also susceptible to a variety of errors (low spatial frequency, high spatial frequency, temporal, ...) in addition to a variety of optical sources of error (spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, etc.). There are also many potential sources of confusion for the star identification algorithm (planets, comets, supernovae, the bimodal character of the point spread function for adjacent stars, other nearby satellites, point-source light pollution from large cities on Earth, ...). There are roughly 57 bright navigational stars in common use. However, for more complex missions, entire star field databases are used to determine spacecraft orientation. A typical star catalog for high-fidelity attitude determination is originated from a standard base catalog (for example from the United States Naval Observatory) and then filtered to remove problematic stars, for example due to apparent magnitude variability, color index uncertainty, or a location within the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram implying unreliability. These types of star catalogs can have thousands of stars stored in memory on board the spacecraft, or else processed using tools at the ground station and then uploaded.\n\n"}

The Erotic is described as a source of personal power and political power. According to her it is often confused with the pornographic and often seen as suspicious in a patriarchal society. The word 'erotic' is derived from the Greek word eros. Eros personifies \"love in all its aspects\".\n\nAccording to Lorde, the erotic has often been confused with the pornographic, resulting in the terms being used interchangeably within western societies. Lorde dismantles this idea and explains that the two are opposites of each other. According to Lorde, \"pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling\". The erotic is defined by our deepest feelings within ourselves while the pornographic \"emphasizes sensation\" and completely dismisses feelings.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon takes Lorde’s concept of pornography being used as a form of oppression and adds to it by asserting that pornography not only works to oppress the erotic power of women, but that it also suppresses women’s freedom of speech. Pornography eroticizes “the unspeakable abuse: the rape, the battery, the sexual harassment, the prostitution, and the sexual abuse of children. Only in the pornography it is called something else: sex, sex, sex, sex, and sex, respectively” which thus contributes to the perpetuation of inequality between men and women and leads to the normalization of these kinds of atrocities. \nThe erotic power that Lorde claims “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” becomes twisted, perverted and used against women to maintain female subordination. MacKinnon connects these images and words to actual cases of rape and sexual assault in that it men take what they have seen in porn and then apply it to their own sexual interactions with women. She quotes a study that claims that men who watched pornography that depicted rape and sexual assault were more inclined towards aggressive behavior towards women and self-reported a greater likelihood that they would engage in acts of rape or sexual assault. These images desensitize men to this kind of aggressive behavior and therefore, when women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped, their voices are not heard because being sexually assaulted or raped is an accepted part of culture represented in pornography. Pornography silences women because it steals their credibility and replaces it with mere “eroticism” which was originally a female ascribed power. \n\n"}

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that true threats are not protected under the U.S. Constitution based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur. There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a \"true threat\" due to concern over terrorism.\n\nThe true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case \"Watts v. United States\". In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States. The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, \"[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.\" Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. \n\nIn reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that \"a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.\" The Court recognized that \"uninhibited, robust, and wideopen\" political debate can at times be characterized by \"vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\" In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more \"a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President\" than a \"true threat.\" In so holding, the Court established that there is a \"true threat\" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole.

{"id": "602650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602650", "title": "Type safety", "text": "Type safety\n\nIn computer science, type safety is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents type errors. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer (int) as a floating-point number (float). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal type-theoretic definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.\n\nType enforcement can be static, catching potential errors at compile time, or dynamic, associating type information with values at run-time and consulting them as needed to detect imminent errors, or a combination of both.\n\nThe behaviors classified as type errors by a given programming language are usually those that result from attempts to perform operations on values that are not of the appropriate data type. This classification is partly based on opinion; it may imply that any operation not leading to program crashes, security flaws or other obvious failures is legitimate and need not be considered an error, or it may imply that any contravention of the programmer's explicit intent (as communicated via typing annotations) to be erroneous and not \"type-safe\".\n\nIn the context of static (compile-time) type systems, type safety usually involves (among other things) a guarantee that the eventual value of any expression will be a legitimate member of that expression's static type. The precise requirement is more subtle than this — see, for example, subtype and polymorphism for complications.\n\nType safety is closely linked to \"memory safety\", a restriction on the ability to copy arbitrary bit patterns from one memory location to another. For instance, in an implementation of a language that has some type formula_1, such that some sequence of bits (of the appropriate length) does not represent a legitimate member of formula_1, if that language allows data to be copied into a variable of type formula_1, then it is not type-safe because such an operation might assign a non-formula_1 value to that variable. Conversely, if the language is type-unsafe to the extent of allowing an arbitrary integer to be used as a pointer, then it is not memory-safe.\n\nMost statically typed languages provide a degree of type safety that is strictly stronger than memory safety, because their type systems enforce the proper use of abstract data types defined by programmers even when this is not strictly necessary for memory safety or for the prevention of any kind of catastrophic failure.\n\nType-safe code accesses only the memory locations it is authorized to access. (For this discussion, type safety specifically refers to memory type safety and should not be confused with type safety in a broader respect.) For example, type-safe code cannot read values from another object's private fields.\n\nRobin Milner provided the following slogan to describe type safety:\nThe appropriate formalization of this slogan depends on the style of formal semantics used for a particular language. In the context of denotational semantics, type safety means that the value of an expression that is well-typed, say with type τ, is a \"bona fide\" member of the set corresponding to τ.\n\nIn 1994, Andrew Wright and Matthias Felleisen formulated what is now the standard definition and proof technique for type safety in languages defined by operational semantics. Under this approach, type safety is determined by two properties of the semantics of the programming language:\n\n\nThese properties do not exist in a vacuum; they are linked to the semantics of the programming language they describe, and there is a large space of varied languages that can fit these criteria, since the notion of \"well typed\" program is part of the static semantics of the programming language and the notion of \"getting stuck\" (or \"going wrong\") is a property of its dynamic semantics.\n\nVijay Saraswat provides the following definition:\n\nType safety is ultimately aimed at excluding other problems, e.g.:-\n\nType safety is usually a requirement for any toy language proposed in academic programming language research. Many languages, on the other hand, are too big for human-generated type safety proofs, as they often require checking thousands of cases. Nevertheless, some languages such as Standard ML, which has rigorously defined semantics, have been proved to meet one definition of type safety. Some other languages such as Haskell are \"believed\" to meet some definition of type safety, provided certain \"escape\" features are not used (for example Haskell's unsafePerformIO, used to \"escape\" from the usual restricted environment in which I/O is possible, circumvents the type system and so can be used to break type safety.) Type punning is another example of such an \"escape\" feature. Regardless of the properties of the language definition, certain errors may occur at run-time due to bugs in the implementation, or in linked libraries written in other languages; such errors could render a given implementation type unsafe in certain circumstances. An early version of Sun's Java virtual machine was vulnerable to this sort of problem.\n\nProgramming languages are often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (also loosely typed) to refer to certain aspects of type safety. In 1974, Liskov and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which \"whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.\"\nIn 1977, Jackson wrote, \"In a strongly typed language each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.\"\nIn contrast, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion.\n\nIn object oriented languages type safety is usually intrinsic in the fact that a type system is in place. This is expressed in terms of class definitions.\n\nA class essentially defines the structure of the objects derived from it and an API as a \"contract\" for handling these objects.\nEach time a new object is created it will \"comply\" with that contract.\n\nEach function that exchanges objects derived from a specific class, or implementing a specific interface, will adhere to that contract: hence in that function the operations permitted on that object will be only those defined by the methods of the class the object implements.\nThis will guarantee that the object integrity will be preserved.\n\nExceptions to this are object oriented languages that allow dynamic modification of the object structure, or the use of reflection to modify the content of an object to overcome the constraints imposed by the class methods definitions.\n\nAda was designed to be suitable for embedded systems, device drivers and other forms of system programming, but also to encourage type-safe programming. To resolve these conflicting goals, Ada confines type-unsafety to a certain set of special constructs whose names usually begin with the string Unchecked_. Unchecked_Deallocation can be effectively banned from a unit of Ada text by applying pragma Pure to this unit. It is expected that programmers will use Unchecked_ constructs very carefully and only when necessary; programs that do not use them are type-safe.\n\nThe SPARK programming language is a subset of Ada eliminating all its potential ambiguities and insecurities while at the same time adding statically checked contracts to the language features available. SPARK avoids the issues with dangling pointers by disallowing allocation at run time entirely.\n\nAda2012 adds statically checked contracts to the language itself (in form of pre-, and post-conditions, as well as type invariants).\n\nThe C programming language is type-safe in limited contexts; for example, a compile-time error is generated when an attempt is made to convert a pointer to one type of structure to a pointer to another type of structure, unless an explicit cast is used. However, a number of very common operations are non-type-safe; for example, the usual way to print an integer is something like codice_2, where the codice_3 tells codice_4 at run-time to expect an integer argument. (Something like codice_5, which erroneously tells the function to expect a pointer to a character-string, may be accepted by compilers, but will produce undefined results.) This is partially mitigated by some compilers (such as gcc) checking type correspondences between printf arguments and format strings.\n\nIn addition, C, like Ada, provides unspecified or undefined explicit conversions; and unlike in Ada, idioms that use these conversions are very common, and have helped to give C a type-unsafe reputation. For example, the standard way to allocate memory on the heap is to invoke a memory allocation function, such as codice_6, with an argument indicating how many bytes are required. The function returns an untyped pointer (type codice_7), which the calling code must explicitly or implicitly cast to the appropriate pointer type. Pre-standardized implementations of C required an explicit cast to do so, therefore the code codice_8 became the accepted practice. However, this practice is discouraged in ISO C as it can mask a failure to include the header file in which codice_6 is defined, resulting in downstream errors on machines where the int and pointer types are of different sizes, such as most common implementations of C for the now-ubiquitous x86-64 architecture. A conflict arises in code that is required to compile as C++, since the cast is necessary in that language.\n\nSome features of C++ that promote more type-safe code:\n\nC# is type-safe (but not statically type-safe). It has support for untyped pointers, but this must be accessed using the \"unsafe\" keyword which can be prohibited at the compiler level. It has inherent support for run-time cast validation. Casts can be validated by using the \"as\" keyword that will return a null reference if the cast is invalid, or by using a C-style cast that will throw an exception if the cast is invalid. See C Sharp conversion operators.\n\nUndue reliance on the object type (from which all other types are derived) runs the risk of defeating the purpose of the C# type system. It is usually better practice to abandon object references in favour of generics, similar to templates in C++ and generics in Java.\n\nThe Java language is designed to enforce type safety. \nAnything in Java \"happens\" inside an object\nand each object is an instance of a class.\n\nTo implement the \"type safety\" enforcement, each object, before usage, needs to be allocated.\nJava allows usage of primitive types but only inside properly allocated objects.\n\nSometimes a part of the type safety is implemented indirectly: e.g. the class BigDecimal represents a floating point number of arbitrary precision, but handles only numbers that can be expressed with a finite representation.\nThe operation BigDecimal.divide() calculates a new object as the division of two numbers expressed as BigDecimal.\n\nIn this case if the division has no finite representation, as when one computes e.g. 1/3=0.33333..., the divide() method can raise an exception if no rounding mode is defined for the operation.\nHence the library, rather than the language, guarantees that the object respects the contract implicit in the class definition.\n\nSML has rigorously defined semantics and is known to be type-safe. However, some implementations of SML, including Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ), its syntactic variant Mythryl and Mlton, provide libraries that offer certain unsafe operations. These facilities are often used in conjunction with those implementations' foreign function interfaces to interact with non-ML code (such as C libraries) that may require data laid out in specific ways. Another example is the SML/NJ interactive toplevel itself, which must use unsafe operations to execute ML code entered by the user.\n\nModula-2 is a strongly typed language with a design philosophy to require any unsafe facilities to be explicitly marked as unsafe. This is achieved by \"moving\" such facilities into a built-in pseudo-library called SYSTEM from where they must be imported before they can be used. The import thus makes it visible when such facilities are used. Unfortunately, this was not consequently implemented in the original language report and its implementation. There still remained unsafe facilities such as the type cast syntax and variant records (inherited from Pascal) that could be used without prior import. The difficulty in moving these facilities into the SYSTEM pseudo-module was the lack of any identifier for the facility that could then be imported since only identifiers can be imported, but not syntax.\n\nThe ISO Modula-2 standard corrected this for the type cast facility by changing the type cast syntax into a function called CAST which has to be imported from pseudo-module SYSTEM. However, other unsafe facilities such as variant records remained available without any import from pseudo-module SYSTEM.\n\nA recent revision of the language applied the original design philosophy rigorously. First, pseudo-module SYSTEM was renamed to UNSAFE to make the unsafe nature of facilities imported from there more explicit. Then all remaining unsafe facilities where either removed altogether (for example variant records) or moved to pseudo-module UNSAFE. For facilities where there is no identifier that could be imported, enabling identifiers were introduced. In order to enable such a facility, its corresponding enabling identifier must be imported from pseudo-module UNSAFE. No unsafe facilities remain in the language that do not require import from UNSAFE.\n\nPascal has had a number of type safety requirements, some of which are kept in some compilers. Where a Pascal compiler dictates \"strict typing\", two variables cannot be assigned to each other unless they are either compatible (such as conversion of integer to real) or assigned to the identical subtype. For example, if you have the following code fragment:\n\nUnder strict typing, a variable defined as TwoTypes is \"not compatible\" with DualTypes (because they are not identical, even though the components of that user defined type are identical) and an assignment of T1 := D2; is illegal. An assignment of T1 := T2; would be legal because the subtypes they are defined to \"are\" identical. However, an assignment such as T1.Q := D1.Q; would be legal.\n\nIn general, Common Lisp is a type-safe language. A Common Lisp compiler is responsible for inserting dynamic checks for operations whose type safety cannot be proven statically. However, a programmer may indicate that a program should be compiled with a lower level of dynamic type-checking. A program compiled in such a mode cannot be considered type-safe.\n\nThe following examples illustrates how C++ cast operators can break type safety when used incorrectly. The first example shows how basic data types can be incorrectly casted:\n\nIn this example, codice_10 explicitly prevents the compiler from performing a safe conversion from integer to floating-point value. When the program runs it will output a garbage floating-point value. The problem could have been avoided by instead writing codice_11\n\nThe next example shows how object references can be incorrectly downcasted:\n\nThe two child classes have members of different types. When downcasting a parent class pointer to a child class pointer, then the resulting pointer may not point to a valid object of correct type. In the example, this leads to garbage value being printed. The problem could have been avoided by replacing codice_12 with codice_13 that throws an exception on invalid casts.\n\n\n"}
