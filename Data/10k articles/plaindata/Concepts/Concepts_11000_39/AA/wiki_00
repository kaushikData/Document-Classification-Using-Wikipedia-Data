The \"dispersion\" formula_2 of two polynomials formula_3 is defined asformula_4where formula_5 denotes the set of non-negative integers. Therefore the dispersion is the maximum formula_6 such that the polynomial formula_7 and the formula_8-times shifted polynomial formula_9 have a common factor. It is formula_10 if such a formula_8 does not exist. The dispersion can be computed as the largest non-negative integer root of the resultant formula_12.

{"id": "65927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65927", "title": "Angular velocity", "text": "Angular velocity\n\nIn physics, the angular velocity of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point: that is, the time rate of change of its angular displacement relative to the origin (i.e. in layman's terms: how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun). It is measured in angle per unit time, radians per second in SI units, and is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, sometimes Ω). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.\n\nFor example, a geostationary satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator, or 360 degrees per 24 hours, and has angular velocity \"ω\" = 360 / 24 = 15 degrees per hour, or 2π / 24 ≈ 0.26 radians per hour. If angle is measured in radians, the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, formula_1. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth's center, the satellite's speed through space is thus \"v\" = 42,000 × 0.26 ≈ 11,000 km/hr. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the Earth's rotation (counter-clockwise from above the north pole.)\n\nIn three dimensions, angular velocity is a pseudovector, with its magnitude measuring the rate of rotation, and its direction pointing along the axis of rotation (perpendicular to the radius and velocity vectors). The up-or-down orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule.\n\nIn the simplest case of circular motion at radius \"r\", with position given by the angular displacement formula_2 from the x-axis, the angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: formula_3. If formula_4 is measured in radians, the distance from the x-axis around the circle to the particle is formula_5, and the linear velocity is formula_6, so that formula_7. \n\nIn the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the angular velocity is measured relative to a chosen center point, called the origin. The diagram shows the radius vector r from the origin \"O\" to the particle \"P\", with its polar coordinates formula_8. (All variables are functions of time \"t\".) The particle has linear velocity splitting as formula_9, with the radial component formula_10 parallel to the radius, and the cross-radial (or tangential or circular) component formula_11 perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.\n\nThe angular velocity \"ω\" is the rate of change of angle with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:\n\nHere the cross-radial speed formula_13 is the signed magnitude of formula_11, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity v gives magnitude \"v\" (linear speed) and angle \"θ\" relative to the radius vector; in these terms, formula_15, so that \n\nThese formulas may be derived from formula_17, formula_18 and formula_19, together with the projection formula formula_20, where formula_21.\n\nIn two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.\n\nIn three-dimensional space, we again have the position vector r of a moving particle, its radius vector from the origin. Angular velocity is a vector (or pseudovector) whose magnitude measures the rate at which the radius sweeps out angle, and whose direction shows the principal axis of rotation. Its up-or-down direction is given by the right-hand rule.\n\nLet the axial vector formula_22 be the unit-length vector perpendicular to the plane of rotation spanned by the radius and velocity vectors, so that the direction of rotation is counter-clockwise looking from the top of formula_22. Taking polar coordinates formula_24 in the plane of rotation, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the angular velocity vector as: \n\nwhere \"θ\" is the angle between r and v. In terms of the cross product, this is:\n\nFrom this, one can recover the tangential velocity as:\n\nIf a point rotates with angular velocity formula_28 in a coordinate frame formula_29 which itself rotates with an angular velocity formula_30 with respect to an external frame formula_31, we can define formula_32 to be the composite angular velocity vector of the point with respect to formula_31. This operation coincides with usual addition of vectors, and it gives angular velocity the algebraic structure of a true vector, rather than just a pseudo-vector.\n\nThe only non-obvious property of the above addition is commutativity. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor \"W\" (see below) is skew-symmetric, so that formula_34 is a rotation matrix which can be expanded as formula_35. The composition of rotations is not commutative, but formula_36 is commutative to first order, and therefore formula_37.\n\nNotice that this also defines the substraction as the addition of a negative vector.\n\nGiven a rotating frame of three unit coordinate vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed at each instant. In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.\n\nThe rotating frame appears in the context of rigid bodies, and special tools have been developed for it: the angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a tensor. \n\nConsistent with the general definition, the angular velocity of a frame is defined as the angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all). The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a gimbal. Components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: formula_37.\n\nBy Euler's rotation theorem, any rotating frame possesses an instantaneous axis of rotation, which is the direction of the angular velocity vector, and the magnitude of the angular velocity is consistent with the two dimensional case.\n\nConsidering a coordinate vector of the frame as a particle, formula_39 with formula_40, we obtain the angular velocity vector:\n\nHere formula_42 are the columns of the matrix of the frame, and formula_43 their time derivatives.\n\nThe components of the angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by Leonhard Euler using his Euler angles and the use of an intermediate frame:\n\nEuler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous Euler rotations). Therefore:\n\nThis basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:\n\nwhere formula_46 are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body. This example has been made using the Z-X-Z convention for Euler angles.\n\nThe angular velocity vector formula_47 defined above may be equivalently expressed as an angular velocity tensor, the matrix (or linear mapping) \"W\" = \"W\"(\"t\") defined by:\n\nThis is an infinitesimal rotation matrix. The linear mapping \"W\" acts as formula_49:\n\nA vector formula_51 undergoing uniform circular motion around an axis satisfies:\n\nGiven the orientation matrix \"A\"(\"t\") of a frame, whose columns are the moving orthonormal coordinate vectors formula_53, we can obtain its angular velocity tensor \"W\"(\"t\") as follows. Angular velocity must be the same for the three vectors formula_54, so arranging the three vector equations into columns of a matrix, we have:\n\n(This holds even if \"A\"(\"t\") does not rotate uniformly.) Therefore the angular velocity tensor is:\n\nsince the inverse of the orthogonal matrix formula_57 is its transpose formula_58.\n\nIn general, the angular velocity in an \"n\"-dimensional space is the time derivative of the angular displacement tensor, which is a second rank skew-symmetric tensor.\n\nThis tensor \"W\" will have independent components, which is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the Lie group of rotations of an \"n\"-dimensional inner product space.\n\nIn three dimensions, angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are dual to pseudovectors in three dimensions. Since the angular velocity tensor \"W\" = \"W\"(\"t\") is a skew-symmetric matrix:\n\nits Hodge dual is a vector, which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector formula_60.\n\nIf we know an initial frame \"A\"(0) and we are given a \"constant\" angular velocity tensor \"W\", we can obtain \"A\"(\"t\") for any given \"t\". Recall the matrix differential equation:\n\nThis equation can be integrated to give:\n\nwhich shows a connection with the Lie group of rotations.\n\nWe prove that angular velocity tensor is skew symmetric, i.e. formula_63 satisfies formula_64.\n\nA rotation matrix \"A\" is orthogonal, inverse to its transpose, so we have formula_65. For formula_66 a frame matrix, taking the time derivative of the equation gives:\n\nApplying the formula formula_68,\n\nThus, \"W\" is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is skew symmetric.\n\nAt any instant formula_70, the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vector formula_71 and the velocity vectors formula_72 of a point on a rigid body rotating around the origin:\n\nThe relation between this linear map and the angular velocity pseudovector formula_74 is the following.\n\nBecause \"W\" is the derivative of an orthogonal transformation, the bilinear form\n\nis skew-symmetric. Thus we can apply the fact of exterior algebra that there is a unique linear form formula_76 on formula_77 that\n\nwhere formula_79 is the exterior product of formula_80 and formula_81.\n\nTaking the sharp \"L\" of \"L\" we get\n\nIntroducing formula_83, as the Hodge dual of \"L\", and applying the definition of the Hodge dual twice supposing that the preferred unit 3-vector is formula_84\n\nwhere\n\nby definition.\n\nBecause formula_81 is an arbitrary vector, from nondegeneracy of scalar product follows\n\nFor angular velocity tensor maps positions to velocities, it is a vector field. In particular, this vector field is a Killing vector field belonging to an element of the Lie algebra so(3) of the 3-dimensional rotation group SO(3). This element of so(3) can also be regarded as the angular velocity vector.\n\nThe same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity \"V\"(\"t\") in each instant.\n\nTo obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed \"laboratory\" system.\n\nAs shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point \"O\", the rigid body system origin is at and the vector from \"O\" to is R. A particle (\"i\") in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is R in the lab frame, and at position r in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:\n\nThe defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector formula_90 is unchanging. By Euler's rotation theorem, we may replace the vector formula_90 with formula_92 where formula_93 is a 3×3 rotation matrix and formula_94 is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say . This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix formula_93 that is changing in time and not the reference vector formula_94, as the rigid body rotates about point . Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three versors of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector formula_90 would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:\n\nTaking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:\n\nwhere V is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and V is the velocity of (the origin of the rigid body frame). Since formula_93 is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose. So we substitute formula_101:\n\nor\n\nwhere formula_106 is the previous angular velocity tensor.\n\nIt can be proved that this is a skew symmetric matrix, so we can take its dual to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector formula_107:\n\nSubstituting \"ω\" for \"W\" into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:\n\nIt can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the \"spin\" angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point about the origin \"O\".\n\nWe have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.\n\nSee the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is \"O\", while \"O\" and \"O\" are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is formula_110 and formula_111 respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to \"O\" and O is formula_112 and formula_113 respectively. Since point \"P\" and \"O\" have only one velocity,\n\nThe above two yields that\n\nSince the point \"P\" (and thus formula_117) is arbitrary, it follows that\n\nIf the reference point is the instantaneous axis of rotation the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.\n\n\n\n"}

Designed by Spanish aviator Colonel José Luis Aresti Aguirre (1919–2003), each figure in the catalog is represented by lines, arrows, geometric shapes and numbers representing the precise form of a manoeuver to be flown.\n\nThe catalog broadly classifies manoeuvers into numbered families. Families 1 through 8 depict basic figures, such as turns, loops and vertical lines; family 9 depicts rotational elements that can be added to basic figures to increase difficulty, change the direction of flight or invert the g-loading of the aircraft.\n\nIn Aresti notation, solid lines represent upright or positive-g manoeuvers and dashed lines represent inverted or negative-g manoeuvers; these are sometimes depicted in red. Thick dot represents the beginning of the manoeuver, while a short perpendicular line represents the end. Stalled wing manoeuvers such as spins and snap (flick) rolls are represented by triangles. Arrows represent rolling manoeuvers with numbers representing the extent and number of segments of the roll.\nThe catalog assigns each manoeuver a unique identifier, called a \"catalog number\", and difficulty factor, represented by the symbol \"K\". When a basic figure is combined with one or more rolling elements, the resultant figure \"K\" is the sum of all component \"K\"s. During an aerobatics competition, judges grade the execution of each manoeuver with a value between 10 (perfect) and 0 (highly flawed). Each figure's grades are multiplied by its \"K\" and summed to yield a total raw score for the flight.\n\nNotational systems for aerobatic manoeuvers have been used since the 1920s.\nThe first system accepted worldwide was published by French aviator François d'Huc Dressler in 1955 and 1956. It was used for international competitions through 1962.\n\nJosé Aresti's development of a notation for aerobatic figures began while serving as an instructor in the Jerez Pilot Training School in the 1940s. By the end of 1961 Aresti published a dictionary of some 3,000 aerobatic manoeuvers, the \"Sistema Aerocryptographica Aresti\". Then employed throughout Spain, the Spanish Aero Club urged its adoption internationally. The FAI's Aerobatics Commission, CIVA, elected to use the catalog beginning at the World Aerobatic Championships held in Bilbao, Spain in 1964; it has been in use worldwide and evolved continually since then. Though the catalog had grown at one time to some 15,000 manoeuvers, a CIVA working group substantially streamlined it in the mid-1980s.\n\nFollowing Aresti's death, a court fight ensued between his heirs and FAI, which once provided a free catalog online.

{"id": "15434333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15434333", "title": "Behavior management", "text": "Behavior management\n\nBehavior management is similar to behavior modification. It is a less intensive version of behavior therapy. In behavior modification, the focus is on changing behavior, while in behavior management the focus is on maintaining order. Behavior management skills are of particular importance to teachers in the educational system. Behavior management include all of the actions and conscious in actions to enhance the probability people, individually and in groups, choose behaviors which are personally fulfilling, productive, and socially acceptable.\n\nThere is a great deal of research related to \"behavior change\" and \"behavior management\". Student Davidson does, in actuality, misinterpret the origination of the theory in connection to England's Industrial Revolution. B.F. Skinner and Carl Rogers have given two distinctly different approaches for addressing the behavior. Skinner's approach says that anyone can manipulate behavior by first identifying what the individual finds rewarding. Once the rewards of an individual are known, then those rewards can be selected that the manager is willing to give in exchange for good behavior. Skinner calls this \"Positive Reinforcement Psychology\". Rogers proposes that in order to effectively address behavior problems, an individual must be persuaded to want to behave appropriately. This is done by teaching the individual the difference between right and wrong including why he or she should do what is right. Rogers believes that the individual must have an internal awareness of right and wrong.\n\nMany of the principles and techniques used are the same as behavior modification yet delivered in a less intensively and consistent fashion. Usually, behavior management is applied at the group level by a classroom teacher as a form of behavioral engineering to produce high rates of student work completion and minimize classroom disruption. In addition, greater focus has been placed on building self-control. Brophy (1986) writes: \nIn general behavior management strategies have been very effective in reducing classroom disruption. In addition, recent efforts have focused on incorporating principles of functional assessment into the process.\n\nWhile such programs can come from a variety of behavioral change theories, the most common practices rely on the use of applied behavior analysis principles such as positive reinforcement and mild punishments (such as response cost and child time-out). Behavioral practices such as differential reinforcement are commonly used. Sometimes, these are delivered in a token economy or a level system., In general, the reward component is considered effective. For example, Cotton (1988) reviewed 37 studies on tokens, praise, and other reward systems and found them to be highly effective in managing student classroom behavior. The most comprehensive review of token procedures to match to children's level of behavioral severity was Walker's text \"The acting out child.\"\n\nThere are three main parts to behavior management systems: Whole group, table group, and individual. These can be things such as marble jars for the class, prize charts for the tables, and a grid chart with 25 spaces for individual students. There are many different types of charts you can find to use for each part.\n\nOver the years, behavioral management principles such as reinforcement, modeling and even the use of punishment have been explored in the building of prosocial behavior. This area is sometimes referred to as \"Behavioral Development\" or Behavior analysis of child development. Midlarsky and colleagues (1973) used a combination of modeling and reinforcement to build altruistic behavior. Two studies exist in which modeling by itself did not increase prosocial behavior; however, modeling is much more effective than instruction giving (such as \"preaching\"). The role of rewards has been implicated in the building of self-control and empathy. Cooperation seems particularly susceptible to rewards. Sharing is another prosocial behavior influenced by reinforcement.\n\nReinforcement is particularly effective at least early in the learning series if context conditions are similar. Evidence exists to show some generalization.\n\nRecent research indicates that behavioral \"interventions\" produce the most valuable results when \"applied\" during early childhood and \"early adolescence.\"\n\nMore controversial has been the role of punishment in forming prosocial behavior. One study found that donation rates of children could be increased by punishing episodes of failure to donate.\n\nThe socialization process continues by peers with reinforcement and punishment playing major roles. Peers are more likely to punish cross-gender play and reinforce play specific to gender.\n\nBehavior management is used when an individual tries to stop problem behavior from another individual. Behavior modification and behavior therapy are two ways to help with behavior management. Behavior therapy is used when an individual is trying to find the course of the behavior, why the individual is behaving the way they are. Behavior modification is a technique to increase or decrease behavior. Using these techniques, one can achieve behavior management. (Goal: Making audience more informed on the topics and using proper grammar and neutral language)\n\nPositive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive and negative punishment are all forms of Operant Conditioning. Reinforcements are when you try to increase behavior, either positively or negatively. If you use positive reinforcement, you add a wanted stimulus for desired behavior (e.g. awarding good behavior with a treat). Negative reinforcement is when you increase behavior by removing something unwanted. (e.g., The child’s room is messy and his mom nags him to clean it up, he eventually keeps it clean to remove his mom’s nagging.) Punishment is trying to decrease behavior, either by using negative or positive. Positive punishment is when you add an unwanted stimulus to decrease the target’s behavior. (e.g., spanking a child when he behaves badly.) Here, spanking is being added to decrease his bad behavior. Negative punishment is when you remove something the target enjoys or likes to remove his or her bad behavior. (e.g. your child comes home past curfew every weekend, you remove watching TV when he is past curfew, therefore, your child’s behavior of coming past curfew will decrease.) This is negative punishment because your child likes to watch TV, so when you take that away from him for being late, he doesn’t like it, therefore, wanting to come home in time to not get that privilege taken away. (Goal: to elaborate and give more background to help reinforce the theory.) \nAbraham Maslow is a very well-known humanist psychologist with his work on hierarchy needs, in which he states that humans have basic needs, and if they are not satisfied, those individuals will not desire anything else. Maslow also claims that humans are never really satisfied, in that our needs are never fully fulfilled, therefore, this can affect how we can behave (e.g., if our needs are never fully fulfilled, then we might not always behave well, even if we do get a treat for good behavior.) A related concept, \"Hawthorne Effect\" involves the manipulation of behavior of somebody being observed. For example, if you’re being studied in an experiment, you might perform better or work harder because you are aware of the attention you are getting. It is this effect of observation that is called the \"Hawthorne Effect\". This is interesting because if we take a child who is behaving very poorly, no matter what, and they were put in an experiment, they might increase their good behavior because they are getting attention from the researcher. The point of operant conditioning in behavior modification is to regulate the behavior. It is a method to use different techniques and tie them all together to monitor how one behaves. It can cause a problem when talking about Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs because in this model Maslow goes on to explain how no one’s needs are fully met. The highest point on Maslow’s pyramid is self-actualization which Maslow argues is the goal in which we do not reach. This can pose a problem when it comes to behavior modification because one might think if that individual can not reach that ultimate goal, why try at all. Self-actualization is the goal in which humans have this sense of belonging or accomplishment. Humans have needs, just like any other breed of animal and when one type of animal does not attain those goals or needs, there is this feeling of dissatisfaction. When a person does not meet that top goal there is a void and that person might feel depressed that he or she can not get to that ultimate step. Using these behavioral modifications or techniques one can train or teach oneself how to better attain these goals.\n"}

{"id": "18160285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18160285", "title": "Cognitive authority", "text": "Cognitive authority\n\nAccording to Rieh (2005), \"Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the cognitive authority theory from social epistemology in his book, \"Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority\". The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position.\" (Rieh, 2005).\n\nWilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.\n\nThe concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be skeptical towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information sources. In other words: It forces us to consider epistemological issues.\n\nDifferent \"movements\", \"paradigms\", \"positions\" or \"schools\" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. \n\"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation\" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp. 52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that IQ was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field (Leon Kamin) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world. \nThe concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from \"experts\" while on the other hand, \"commonsensism\" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.\n\nIn about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and source criticism. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant \"paradigm\" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider \"cognitive authority\".\n\nHowever, inside history, the \"paradigm\" shifted to \"the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before\".\n\nFor some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: \"[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations\nof the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the\nknowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned\nby the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.\nProfessional historiography for White [1973] generates no\nmore objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical\nnovel.\" \n\nWhat is considered \"cognitive authority\" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the \"paradigm\" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded \"cognitive authority\" is in the end an epistemological argument.\n\nThe concept of cognitive authority was developed in library and information science and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.\n\n\"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought\" (Pierce, 1991, p. 31).\n\n\n"}

In the Middle Ages in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in courtesy books.\n\nThe apex of European courtly culture was reached in the Late Middle Ages and the Baroque period (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). \nThe oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, the most influential of them being \"Il Cortegiano\" (1508), which not only covered basic etiquette and decorum but also provided models of sophisticated conversation and intellectual skill.\nThe royal courts of Europe did, of course, persist well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the notion of \"courtesy\" was replaced by that of \"gallantry\", referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected sensitivity in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. \nDuring the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, with the emergence of a middle class with its own set of bourgeois etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of Marxism as \"petite bourgeoisie\".\n\nThe analogue concept in the court culture of medieval India was known by the Sanskrit term \"dakṣiṇya\", literally meaning \"right-handedness\", but as in English \"dexterity\" having a figurative meaning of \"apt, clever, appropriate\", glossed as \"kindness and consideration expressed in a sophisticated and elegant way\".\n"}
{"id": "44416635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44416635", "title": "Domestic violence in lesbian relationships", "text": "Domestic violence in lesbian relationships\n\nDomestic violence within lesbian relationships is the pattern of violent and coercive behavior in a female same-sex relationship wherein a lesbian or other non-heterosexual woman seeks to control the thoughts, beliefs, or conduct of her female intimate partner. In the case of multiple forms of domestic partner abuse, it is also referred to as lesbian battering.\n\nThe issue of domestic violence among lesbians has become a serious social concern, but the topic has often been ignored, both in academic analyses and in the establishment of social services for battered women.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention\" states, \"For several methodological reasons – nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others – it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association.\" Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than that among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.\n\nThe issue of domestic violence among lesbian couples may be underreported due to the social construction of gender roles that women are expected to play in society; violence perpetrated by women may be ignored due to beliefs that the male social construction itself is a primary source of violence. The social construction of women is characterized as passive, dependent, nurturing, and highly emotional, and the social construction of men is characterized as competitive, aggressive, strong, and even prone to violence. Due to forms of discrimination, homophobia, and heterosexism, and the belief that heterosexuality is normative within society, domestic violence has been characterized as being between the male perpetrator and the female victim. This contributes to the invisibility of all domestic violence perpetrated by women. Further, the fear of reinforcing negative stereotypes could lead some community members, activists, and victims to deny the extent of violence among lesbians. Social service agencies are often unwilling to assist victims of domestic violence perpetrated by women. Victims of domestic violence in lesbian relationships are less likely to have the case prosecuted within a legal system.\n\nIn an effort to overcome the denial of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, advocates for abused women often concentrate on similarities between homosexual and heterosexual domestic violence. The main goal of activists is to legitimize lesbian domestic violence as real abuse and validate the experience of its victims.\n\nLiterature and research regarding domestic violence in lesbian relationships is relatively limited, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Many different factors play into this, such as \"different definitions of domestic violence, non-random, self selected and opportunistic sampling methods (often organisation or agency based, or advertising for participants who have experienced violence) and different methods and types of data collected\". This causes results to be unreliable, thus making it difficult to make general assumptions about the rates of lesbian domestic violence. This has caused rates of violence in lesbian relationships to range from 17 to 73 percent as of the 1990s, being too large of a scale to accurately determine the pervasiveness of lesbian abuse in the community.\n\nSince not all lesbians are open about their sexuality, large random samples are difficult to obtain and therefore are unable to show trends in the general lesbian community. Research samples tend to be smaller, causing report rates of violence to be lower than they may be. This is \"a consequence of the invisibility of such violence and fear of homophobic reactions\".\n\nTheoretical analysis of domestic violence in lesbian relationships is heavily debated. Popular approaches mainly discuss \"the comparability of violence in lesbian and gay male relationships (same sex violence,) or draw on feminist theories of gendered power relations, comparing domestic violence between lesbians and heterosexual women\". Some theorists also study same sex violence by defining gender as anatomy, and claim that gender is not relevant in any case of domestic violence due to its prevalence in same-sex relationships that is perpetrated as a form of homophobic behavior and occurs without consequence. Other theorists argue that gay men and lesbians still internalize feminine and masculine behaviors, causing lesbians to \"mimic traditional heterosexual relationships\" and create blatant power dynamics between dominant and submissive partners.\n\nThe scope of domestic violence among lesbian relationships displays the pattern of intimidation, coercion, terrorism, or violence that achieves enhanced power and control for the perpetrator over her partner. The forms of domestic violence in lesbian relationships include physical abuse, such as hitting, choking, using weapons, or restraining, often referred to as \"battering\"; emotional abuse, such as lying, neglecting, and degrading; intimidation threats, such as threats to harm the victim, their family, or their pets; sexual abuse, such as forcing sex or refusing safe sex; destruction of property, such as vandalizing the home and damaging furniture, clothing, or personal objects; economic, such as controlling the victim's money and forcing financial dependence. In addition, psychological abuse was found to be common among lesbian victims. Findings from studies have shown that slapping was most the commonly reported form of abuse, while beatings and assaults with weapons were less frequent. Sexual violence within lesbian relationships was found to be as high as 55%. The most frequent type included forced kissing, breast, and genital fondling, and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. Eighty percent of victims reported psychological abuse and verbal abuse. Lesbians are also less likely to use physical force or threats than gay men.\n\nFactors that contribute to domestic violence include the belief that abuse (physical or verbal) is acceptable, substance abuse, unemployment, mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser. Factors specific to lesbian relationships such as emotional isolation and lack of community ties due to heterosexism and homophobia, minority stress, and the re-victimization of women who have previously suffered abuse also provoke the causes of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. The political context of homophobia and heterosexism is essential for understanding the experience of lesbian victims of domestic violence. Also homophobia is an important factor in shaping the experience of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. For instance, mental health agencies still contain homophobic and heterosexual beliefs which limit the extent of the services provided to the victims. These victims experience violence within the context of a world that is not only misogynistic but is also homophobic.\n\nLesbian couples frequently experience social stigma against them, including experiences of discrimination and bias against them, as well as other minority stress factors which can include the fear of outing, internalized homophobia, the butch/femme identity, and relationship quality. \n\nA perpetrator may use her partner's internalized homophobia to justify her own violence. This may cause a general distaste or negative conception of the lesbian identity, both of oneself and others. This behavior is described as horizontal hostility, or minority groups becoming hostile or violent toward each other. This stems from both finding it easier to direct hatred toward other oppressed groups and internalized homophobia and misogyny. In the case of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, this hostility is perpetuated in the form of intimate partner abuse.\n\nIn some cases, the lesbian community can dismiss cases of domestic violence in lesbian relationships or shame victims of domestic violence. This contributes to low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, denial of group membership, and difficulty being in committed and trusting relationships. These negative feelings are then acted out in the form of lesbian battering. Also women fear that they might suffer from isolation, risk of losing their job, housing or family as consequences to homophobia and internalized homophobia. A woman who abuses her female partner can use homophobic control as a method of psychological abuse, which further isolates the victim. For example, an abuser may out her partner without permission by revealing her sexual orientation to others, including relatives, employers, and landlords, and in child custody cases. This form of abuse could result in a variety of negative consequences for the victim, such as being shunned by family members and the loss of children, a job, and housing. In fearing isolation due to homophobia, lesbians also experience the phenomenon of living in the \"second closet\", or that they must keep both their sexualities and experiences with domestic violence hidden from others due to fear of negative repercussions. These homophobic roots also integrate themselves into how lesbians raise their children.\n\nMany lesbians who are either battered or batter have had experience with domestic violence and sexual assault, often familial or as a child, including beatings, incest, molestation, and verbal abuse. In growing up in living situations where violence is \"normalized\", the partner often does not label the problem or recognize that the violence within the relationship is an issue. This can also translate into how the couple raise potential children and implement discipline.\n\nDomestic violence in lesbian relationships happens for many reasons. Domestic violence can occur due to control. Violence is most frequently employed as a tactic for achieving interpersonal power or control over their partner. Also perceived loss of power or control may also lead to increased violence within the relationship. The alienation and isolation imposed by internalized and external oppression may construct loss of control, and the need to reclaim it becomes the central concern for lesbians. Lesbians may be denied control over numerous aspects of their lives. However, if she remains in the closet, she is also denied control, subjected to continuous self-monitoring, and forced to deal with stress so that she could hide her identity and her intimate relationship from the eyes of others. The perpetrator of violence in an intimate relationship can also threaten their partner to abduct their children if only one has legal custody of their children. On the contrary, there have also been cases of lesbians and lesbian couples that become \"guardian ad litems\" and households that have been licensed to provide temporary foster care for children that are vulnerable to domestic violence. Power and control take advantage the most intimate parts of lesbian relationships, including sex life and the individual agency of the victim in the relationship.\n\nAnother reason why domestic violence can occur is dependency. The need to achieve balance between separateness and connection has been identified as the primary task in relationships, and is a specifically frequent problem in lesbian relationships. The degree of dependence on a relationship and on one's intimate partner causes abuse. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflict with their partner will report a higher level of dependency as a personality trait.\n\nDependency in lesbian relationships is also a result of female-specific socialization. Since women have been socialized for \"togetherness\" and cooperative living, women often struggle with balancing social life and being alone. A study found that lesbians are more likely to spend free time at home than homosexual men are. In lesbian relationships, women often find it difficult to spend time apart because they feel pressured to take care of one another. Women may assume that spending time away from their partner would make them upset or angry. Without proper communication, improper management of time may lead to unhealthy discourse within a relationship, and partner equality remains difficult to maintain.\n\nSelf-esteem is another underlying factor of domestic abuse. Low self-esteem and a negative self-image are qualities that characterize both perpetrators and victims of heterosexual domestic violence. The jealousy and the possessiveness that are frequently linked to battering behavior are associated with problems of low self-esteem and negative self-concept. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflicts with their partners will report a lower level of self-esteem as a personality trait.\n\nDomestic violence shelters also provide heterocentric services for battered women, which further isolates battered lesbians and silences the pervasiveness of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. The perpetrator of violence in an abusive relationship is often assumed to be male, while the victim of the violence is assumed to be straight. These services can be improved by ensuring that the case statement of an agency unit is LGBTQ friendly, providing training services for faculty and staff at shelters, making sure that all services does not have heterosexist language, and providing opportunities for lesbians to take leadership positions in these endeavors.\n\n"}
{"id": "13568947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13568947", "title": "Dualistic cosmology", "text": "Dualistic cosmology\n\nDualism in cosmology is the moral or spiritual belief that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other. It is an umbrella term that covers a diversity of views from various religions, including both traditional religions and scriptural religions.\n\nMoral dualism is the belief of the great complement of, or conflict between, the benevolent and the malevolent. It simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be \"moral\" and independent of how these may be represented. Moral opposites might, for example, exist in a worldview which has one god, more than one god, or none. By contrast, duotheism, bitheism or ditheism implies (at least) two gods. While bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, or light and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system could be one in which one god is a creator, and the other a destroyer. In theology, dualism can also refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe (see theistic dualism). This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism. Alternatively, in ontological dualism, the world is divided into two overarching categories. The opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of yin and yang is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of Taoism. It is also discussed in Confucianism.\n\nMany myths and creation motifs with dualistic cosmologies have been described in ethnographic and anthropological literature. These motifs conceive the world as being created, organized, or influenced by two demiurges, culture heroes, or other mythological beings, who either compete with each other or have a complementary function in creating, arranging or influencing the world. There is a huge diversity of such cosmologies. In some cases, such as among the Chukchi, the beings collaborate rather than competing, and contribute to the creation in a coequal way. In many other instances the two beings are not of the same importance or power (sometimes, one of them is even characterized as gullible). Sometimes they can be contrasted as good versus evil. They may be often believed to be twins or at least brothers. Dualistic motifs in mythologies can be observed in all inhabited continents. Zolotaryov concludes that they cannot be explained by diffusion or borrowing, but are rather of convergent origin: they are related to a dualistic organization of society (moieties); in some cultures, this social organization may have ceased to exist, but mythology preserves the memory in more and more disguised ways.\n\nMoral dualism is the belief of the great complement or conflict between the benevolent and the malevolent. Like ditheism/bitheism (see below), moral dualism does not imply the absence of monist or monotheistic principles. Moral dualism simply implies that there are two moral opposites at work, independent of any interpretation of what might be \"moral\" and—unlike ditheism/bitheism—independent of how these may be represented.\n\nFor example, Mazdaism (Mazdean Zoroastrianism) is both dualistic and monotheistic (but not monist by definition) since in that philosophy God—the Creator—is purely good, and the antithesis—which is also uncreated–is an absolute one. Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), Manichaeism, and Mandaeism are representative of dualistic \"and\" monist philosophies since each has a supreme and transcendental First Principle from which the two equal-but-opposite entities then emanate. This is also true for the lesser-known Christian gnostic religions, such as Bogomils, Catharism, and so on. More complex forms of monist dualism also exist, for instance in Hermeticism, where \"Nous\" \"thought\"—that is described to have created man—brings forth both good and evil, dependent on interpretation, whether it receives prompting from the God or from the Demon. Duality with pluralism is considered a logical fallacy.\n\nMoral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods Set (disorder, death) and Osiris (order, life). The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that Ahura Mazda is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from \"druj\", which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give \"druj\" power. Personal dualism is even more distinct in the beliefs of later religions.\n\nThe religious dualism of Christianity between good and evil is not a perfect dualism as God (good) will inevitably destroy Satan (evil). Early Christian dualism is largely based on Platonic Dualism (See: Neoplatonism and Christianity). There is also a personal dualism in Christianity with a soul-body distinction based on the idea of an immaterial Christian soul.\n\nWhen used with regards to multiple gods, \"dualism\" may refer to duotheism, bitheism, or ditheism. Although ditheism/bitheism imply moral dualism, they are not equivalent: ditheism/bitheism implies (at least) two gods, while moral dualism does not necessarily imply \"theism\" (theos = god) at all.\n\nBoth bitheism and ditheism imply a belief in two equally powerful gods with complementary or antonymous properties; however, while bitheism implies harmony, ditheism implies rivalry and opposition, such as between good and evil, bright and dark, or summer and winter. For example, a ditheistic system would be one in which one god is creative, the other is destructive (cf. theodicy). In the original conception of Zoroastrianism, for example, Ahura Mazda was the spirit of ultimate good, while Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) was the spirit of ultimate evil.\n\nIn a bitheistic system, by contrast, where the two deities are not in conflict or opposition, one could be male and the other female (cf. duotheism). One well-known example of a bitheistic or duotheistic theology based on gender polarity is found in the neopagan religion of Wicca. In Wicca, dualism is represented in the belief of a god and a goddess as a dual partnership in ruling the universe. This is centered on the worship of a divine couple, the Moon Goddess and the Horned God, who are regarded as lovers. However, there is also a ditheistic theme within traditional Wicca, as the Horned God has dual aspects of bright and dark - relating to day/night, summer/winter - expressed as the Oak King and the Holly King, who in Wiccan myth and ritual are said to engage in battle twice a year for the hand of the Goddess, resulting in the changing seasons. (Within Wicca, bright and dark do not correspond to notions of \"good\" and \"evil\" but are aspects of the natural world, much like yin and yang in Taoism.)\n\n\nHowever, bitheistic and ditheistic principles are not always so easily contrastable, for instance in a system where one god is the representative of summer and drought and the other of winter and rain/fertility (cf. the mythology of Persephone). Marcionism, an early Christian sect, held that the Old and New Testaments were the work of two opposing gods: both were First Principles, but of different religions.\n\nIn theology, dualism can refer to the relationship between God and creation or God and the universe. This form of dualism is a belief shared in certain traditions of Christianity and Hinduism.\n\nThe dualism between God and Creation has existed as a central belief in multiple historical sects and traditions of Christianity, including Marcionism, Catharism, Paulicianism, and Gnostic Christianity. Christian dualism refers to the belief that God and creation are distinct, but interrelated through an indivisible bond. In sects like the Cathars and the Paulicians, this is a dualism between the material world, created by an evil god, and a moral god. Historians divide Christian dualism into absolute dualism, which held that the good and evil gods were equally powerful, and mitigated dualism, which held that material evil was subordinate to the spiritual good. The belief, by Christian theologians who adhere to a libertarian or compatibilist view of free will, that free will separates humankind from God has also been characterized as a form of dualism. The theologian Leroy Stephens Rouner compares the dualism of Christianity with the dualism that exists in Zoroastrianism and the Samkhya tradition of Hinduism. The theological use of the word dualism dates back to 1700, in a book that describes the dualism between good and evil.\n\nThe tolerance of dualism ranges widely among the different Christian traditions. As a monotheistic religion, the conflict between dualism and monism has existed in Christianity since its inception. The 1912 \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" describes that, in the Catholic Church, \"the dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with God was of course rejected\" by the thirteenth century, but mind–body dualism was not. The problem of evil is difficult to reconcile with absolute monism, and has prompted some Christian sects to veer towards dualism. Gnostic forms of Christianity were more dualistic, and some Gnostic traditions posited that the Devil was separate from God as an independent deity. The Christian dualists of the Byzantine Empire, the Paulicians, were seen as Manichean heretics by Byzantine theologians. This tradition of Christian dualism, founded by Constantine-Silvanus, argued that the universe was created through evil and separate from a moral God.\n\nThe Cathars, a Christian sect in southern France, believed that there was a dualism between two gods, one representing good and the other representing evil. The Roman Catholic Church denounced the Cathars as heretics, and sought to crush the movement in the 13th century. The Albigensian Crusade was initiated by Pope Innocent III in 1208 to remove the Cathars from Languedoc in France, where they were known as Albigesians. The Inquisition, which began in 1233 under Pope Gregory IX, also targeted the Cathars.\n\nGnosticism is a diverse, syncretistic religious movement consisting of various belief systems generally united in the teaching that humans are divine souls trapped in a material world created by an imperfect god, the demiurge, who is frequently identified with the Abrahamic God. The demiurge may be depicted as an embodiment of evil, or in other instances as merely imperfect and as benevolent as its inadequacy permits. This demiurge exists alongside another remote and unknowable supreme being that embodies good.\n\nBogomils, Paulicans and Cathars are typically seen as being imitative of Gnosticism. Whether or not the Cathari possessed direct historical influence from ancient Gnosticism is a matter of dispute. The basic conceptions of Gnostic cosmology are, however, to be found in Cathar beliefs (most distinctly in their notion of a lesser creator god). Unlike the second century Gnostics, they did not apparently place any special relevance upon knowledge (\"gnosis\") as an effective salvific force.\n\nThe Dvaita Vedanta school of Indian philosophy espouses a dualism between God and the universe by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the more important reality is that of Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu or Brahman. Shiva or Shakti or Vishnu is the supreme Self, God, the absolute truth of the universe, the independent reality. The second reality is that of dependent but equally real universe that exists with its own separate essence. Everything that is composed of the second reality, such as individual soul (Jiva), matter, etc. exist with their own separate reality. The distinguishing factor of this philosophy as opposed to Advaita Vedanta (monistic conclusion of Vedas) is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe. Because the existence of individuals is grounded in the divine, they are depicted as reflections, images or even shadows of the divine, but never in any way identical with the divine. Salvation therefore is described as the realization that all finite reality is essentially dependent on the Supreme.\n\nAlternatively, \"dualism\" can mean the tendency of humans to perceive and understand the world as being divided into two overarching categories. In this sense, it is dualistic when one perceives a tree as a thing separate from everything surrounding it. This form of ontological dualism exists in Taoism and Confucianism, beliefs that divide the universe into the complementary oppositions of yin and yang. In traditions such as classical Hinduism, Zen Buddhism or Islamic Sufism, a key to enlightenment is \"transcending\" this sort of dualistic thinking, without merely substituting dualism with monism or pluralism.\n\nThe opposition and combination of the universe's two basic principles of yin and yang is a large part of Chinese philosophy, and is an important feature of Taoism, both as a philosophy and as a religion, although the concept developed much earlier. Some argue that yin and yang were originally an earth and sky god, respectively. As one of the oldest principles in Chinese philosophy, yin and yang are also discussed in Confucianism, but to a lesser extent.\n\nSome of the common associations with yang and yin, respectively, are: male and female, light and dark, active and passive, motion and stillness. Some scholars believe that the two ideas may have originally referred to two opposite sides of a mountain, facing towards and away from the sun. The yin and yang symbol in actuality has very little to do with Western dualism; instead it represents the philosophy of balance, where two opposites co-exist in harmony and are able to transmute into each other. In the yin-yang symbol there is a dot of yin in yang and a dot of yang in yin. In Taoism, this symbolizes the inter-connectedness of the opposite forces as different aspects of Tao, the First Principle. Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.\n\nThe complementary dualistic concept seen in yin and yang represent the reciprocal interaction throughout nature, related to a feedback loop, where opposing forces do not exchange in opposition but instead exchange reciprocally to promote stabilization similar to homeostasis. An underlying principle in Taoism states that within every independent entity lies a part of its opposite. Within sickness lies health and vice versa. This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.\n\nIn a Nenets myth, Num and Nga collaborate and compete with each other, creating land, there are also other myths about competing-collaborating demiurges.\n\nAmong others, also dualistic myths were investigated in researches which tried to compare the mythologies of Siberian peoples and settle the problem of their origins. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared the mythology of Ket people with those of Uralic peoples, assuming in the studies, that there are modelling semiotic systems in the compared mythologies; and they have also made typological comparisons. Among others, from possibly Uralic mythological analogies, those of Ob-Ugric peoples and Samoyedic peoples are mentioned. Some other discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, and purely typological considerations, certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to dualistic organization of society—some of such dualistic features can be found at these compared peoples. It must be admitted that, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of society nor cosmological dualism has been researched thoroughly: if such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered; although there are some reports on division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties, folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and also on cooperation of two beings in creating the land: the diving of the water fowl. If we include dualistic cosmologies meant in broad sense, not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then we find that they are much more widespread, they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but there are examples in each inhabited continent.\n\nA Chukchi myth and its variations report the creation of the world; in some variations, it is achieved by the collaboration of several beings (birds, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator and the raven, collaborating in a coequal way; or the creator alone, using the birds only as assistants).\n\nAll three Fuegian tribes had dualistic myths about culture heros. The Yámana have dualistic myths about the two brothers. They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation with each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Kwanyip-brothers of the Selk'nam. In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not imply relatedness or diffusion necessarily.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1239477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1239477", "title": "Eccentricity (behavior)", "text": "Eccentricity (behavior)\n\nEccentricity (also called quirkiness) is unusual or odd behavior on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary, without being demonstrably maladaptive. Eccentricity is contrasted with normal behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and pursue certain priorities in everyday life. People who consistently display benignly eccentric behavior are labeled as \"eccentrics\".\n\nFrom Medieval Latin \"eccentricus\", derived from Greek \"ekkentros\", \"out of the center\", from \"ek\"-, \"ex\"- \"out of\" + \"kentron\", \"center\". \"Eccentric\" first appeared in English essays as a neologism in 1551 as an astronomical term meaning \"a circle in which the earth, sun, etc. deviates from its center.\" Five years later, in 1556, an adjective form of the word was used. In 1685, the definition evolved from the literal to the figurative, and \"eccentric\" is noted to have begun being used to describe unconventional or odd behavior. A noun form of the word – a person who possesses and exhibits these unconventional or odd qualities and behaviors – appeared by 1832.\n\nEccentricity is often associated with genius, intellectual giftedness, or creativity. People may perceive the individual's eccentric behavior as the outward expression of their unique intelligence or creative impulse. In this vein, the eccentric's habits are incomprehensible not because they are illogical or the result of madness, but because they stem from a mind so original that it cannot be conformed to societal norms. English utilitarian thinker John Stuart Mill () wrote that \"the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained,\" and mourned a lack of eccentricity as \"the chief danger of the time\". Edith Sitwell () wrote that eccentricity is \"often a kind of innocent pride\", also saying that geniuses and aristocrats are called eccentrics because \"they are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd\". Eccentricity is also associated with great wealth. What would be considered signs of insanity in a poor person, some may accept as eccentricity in wealthy people.\n\nA person who is simply in a \"fish out of water\" situation is not, by the strictest definition, an eccentric since (presumably) he or she may be ordinary by the conventions of his or her native environment.\n\nEccentrics may or may not comprehend the standards for normal behavior in their culture. They are simply unconcerned by society's disapproval of their habits or beliefs. Many of history's most brilliant minds have displayed some unusual behaviors and habits.\n\nSome eccentrics are pejoratively considered \"cranks\" rather than geniuses. Eccentric behavior is often considered whimsical or quirky, although it can also be strange and disturbing. Many individuals previously considered merely eccentric, such as aviation magnate Howard Hughes, have recently been retrospectively diagnosed as actually having had mental disorders (obsessive–compulsive disorder in Hughes' case).\n\nOther people may have an eccentric taste in clothes, or eccentric hobbies or collections they pursue with great vigor. They may have a pedantic and precise manner of speaking, intermingled with inventive wordplay.\n\nMany individuals may even manifest eccentricities consciously and deliberately in an attempt to differentiate themselves from societal norms or enhance a sense of inimitable identity. Given the overwhelmingly positive stereotypes (at least in popular culture and especially with fictional characters) often associated with eccentricity, as detailed above, certain individuals seek to be associated with this sort of character type. However, this is not always successful as eccentric individuals are not necessarily charismatic and the individual in question may simply be dismissed by others as just seeking attention.\n\n\"Extravagance\" is a kind of eccentricity, related to abundance and wastefulness; refer to description in \"hyperbole\".\n\nPsychologist David Weeks believes people with a mental illness \"suffer\" from their behavior while eccentrics are quite happy. He even states eccentrics are \"less\" prone to mental illness than everyone else.\n\nAccording to Weeks' study, there are several distinctive characteristics that often differentiate a healthy eccentric person from a regular person or someone who has a mental illness. The first five characteristics on Weeks' list are found in most people regarded as eccentric:\n\n\n"}

Given this, the structures can be shown to coincide, and the resulting monoid demonstrated to be commutative. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher homotopy groups. The principle is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton, who used it in a 1962 paper.\n\nLet formula_1 be a set equipped with two binary operations, which we will write formula_2 and formula_3, and suppose:\n\n\nThen formula_2 and formula_3 are the same and in fact commutative and associative.\n\nThe operations formula_3 and formula_2 are often referred to as multiplications, but this might imply they are associative, a property which is not required for the proof. In fact, associativity follows. Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.\n\nFirst, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:\nformula_12.\nNow, let formula_13.\nThen formula_14. This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.\n\nFor associativity, formula_15.\n\nIf the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on formula_1, and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that formula_3 is a monoid homomorphism formula_18 (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If formula_1 is a monoid object in the category of monoids, then formula_1 is in fact a commutative monoid.\n\nIt is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a triviality result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of groupoids turns out to be equivalent to the notion of crossed module. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. \n\nMore generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the interchange law in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) double category is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written formula_21 then the interchange law reads \nwhenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. \n\nThe history in relation to homotopy groups is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian fundamental group was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian homology groups could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group made abelian. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. \n\nIn 1932, Eduard Čech submitted a paper on higher homotopy groups to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zurich. However, Pavel Alexandroff and Heinz Hopf quickly proved these groups were abelian for formula_23, and on these grounds persuaded Cech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the \"Proceedings\". It is said that Witold Hurewicz attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935. Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage. \n\nCubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed for filtered spaces in the book \"Nonabelian algebraic topology\" cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, without using singular homology or simplicial approximation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1058787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1058787", "title": "Erikson's stages of psychosocial development", "text": "Erikson's stages of psychosocial development\n\nErikson's stages of psychosocial development, as articulated in the second half of the 20th century by Erik Erikson in collaboration with Joan Erikson, is a comprehensive psychoanalytic theory that identifies a series of eight stages that a healthy developing individual should pass through from infancy to late adulthood.\n\nErikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating his or her biological and sociocultural forces. Each stage is characterized by a psychosocial crisis of these two conflicting forces. If an individual does indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned attribute in the crisis), he or she emerges from the stage with the corresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage (autonomy vs. shame and doubt) with more trust than mistrust, he or she carries the virtue of hope into the remaining life stages. The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be expected to return as problems in the future. However, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage. The outcome of one stage is not permanent and can be modified by later experiences.\n\n\nThe first stage of Erik Erikson's theory centers around the infant's basic needs being met by the parents and how this interaction leads to trust or mistrust. Trust as defined by Erikson is \"an essential trustfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one's own trustworthiness.\" The infant depends on the parents, especially the mother, for sustenance and comfort. The child's relative understanding of world and society comes from the parents and their interaction with the child. A child's first trust is always with the parent or caregiver; whoever that might be, however, the caregiver is secondary whereas the parents are primary in the eyes of the child. If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularity, and dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. Should parents fail to provide a secure environment and to meet the child's basic needs; a sense of mistrust will result. Development of mistrust can lead to feelings of frustration, suspicion, withdrawal, and a lack of confidence.\n\nAccording to Erik Erikson, the major developmental task in infancy is to learn whether or not other people, especially primary caregivers, regularly satisfy basic needs. If caregivers are consistent sources of food, comfort, and affection, an infant learns trust — that others are dependable and reliable. If they are neglectful, or perhaps even abusive, the infant instead learns mistrust — that the world is an undependable, unpredictable, and possibly a dangerous place. While negative, having some experience with mistrust allows the infant to gain an understanding of what constitutes dangerous situations later in life; yet being at the stage of infant or toddler, it is a good idea not to put them in prolonged situations of mistrust: the child's number one needs are to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for.\n\nAs the child gains control over eliminative functions and motor abilities, they begin to explore their surroundings. Parents still provide a strong base of security from which the child can venture out to assert their will. The parents' patience and encouragement helps foster autonomy in the child. Children at this age like to explore the world around them and they are constantly learning about their environment. Caution must be taken at this age while children may explore things that are dangerous to their health and safety. \n\nAt this age children develop their first interests. For example, a child who enjoys music may like to play with the radio. Children who enjoy the outdoors may be interested in animals and plants. Highly restrictive parents, however, are more likely to instill in the child a sense of doubt, and reluctance to attempt new challenges. As they gain increased muscular coordination and mobility, toddlers become capable of satisfying some of their own needs. They begin to feed themselves, wash and dress themselves, and use the bathroom.\n\nIf caregivers encourage self-sufficient behavior, toddlers develop a sense of autonomy—a sense of being able to handle many problems on their own. But if caregivers demand too much too soon, or refuse to let children perform tasks of which they are capable, or ridicule early attempts at self-sufficiency, children may instead develop shame and doubt about their ability to handle problems.\n\nInitiative adds to autonomy the quality of planning, undertaking and attacking a task for the sake of just being active and on the move. The child is learning to master the world around them, learning basic skills and principles of physics. Things fall down, not up. Round things roll. They learn how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease. At this stage, the child wants to begin and complete their own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a confusing new emotion. They may feel guilty over things that logically should not cause guilt. They may feel guilt when this initiative does not produce desired results.\n\nThe development of courage and independence are what set preschoolers, ages three to six years of age, apart from other age groups. Young children in this category face the challenge of initiative versus guilt. As described in Bee and Boyd (2004), the child during this stage faces the complexities of planning and developing a sense of judgment. During this stage, the child learns to take initiative and prepare for leadership and goal achievement roles. Activities sought out by a child in this stage may include risk-taking behaviors, such as crossing a street alone or riding a bike without a helmet; both these examples involve self-limits. \n\nWithin instances requiring initiative, the child may also develop negative behaviors. These negative behaviors are a result of the child developing a sense of frustration for not being able to achieve a goal as planned and may engage in negative behaviors that seem aggressive, ruthless, and overly assertive to parents. Aggressive behaviors, such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling, are examples of observable behaviors during this stage.\n\nPreschoolers are increasingly able to accomplish tasks on their own, and can start new things. With this growing independence comes many choices about activities to be pursued. Sometimes children take on projects they can readily accomplish, but at other times they undertake projects that are beyond their capabilities or that interfere with other people's plans and activities. If parents and preschool teachers encourage and support children's efforts, while also helping them make realistic and appropriate choices, children develop initiative—independence in planning and undertaking activities. But if, instead, adults discourage the pursuit of independent activities or dismiss them as silly and bothersome, children develop guilt about their needs and desires.\n\nThe aim to bring a productive situation to completion gradually supersedes the whims and wishes of play.\nThe fundamentals of technology are developed. The failure to master trust, autonomy, and industrious skills may cause the child to doubt his or her future, leading to shame, guilt, and the experience of defeat and inferiority. \n\nThe child must deal with demands to learn new skills or risk a sense of inferiority, failure, and incompetence.\n\n\"Children at this age are becoming more aware of themselves as individuals.\" They work hard at \"being responsible, being good and doing it right.\" They are now more reasonable to share and cooperate. Allen and Marotz (2003) also list some perceptual cognitive developmental traits specific for this age group. Children grasp the concepts of space and time in more logical, practical ways. They gain a better understanding of cause and effect, and of calendar time. At this stage, children are eager to learn and accomplish more complex skills: reading, writing, telling time. They also get to form moral values, recognize cultural and individual differences and are able to manage most of their personal needs and grooming with minimal assistance. At this stage, children might express their independence by talking back and being disobedient and rebellious.\n\nErikson viewed the elementary school years as critical for the development of self-confidence. Ideally, elementary school provides many opportunities to achieve the recognition of teachers, parents and peers by producing things—drawing pictures, solving addition problems, writing sentences, and so on. If children are encouraged to make and do things and are then praised for their accomplishments, they begin to demonstrate industry by being diligent, persevering at tasks until completed, and putting work before pleasure. If children are instead ridiculed or punished for their efforts or if they find they are incapable of meeting their teachers' and parents' expectations, they develop feelings of inferiority about their capabilities.\n\nAt this age, children start recognizing their special talents and continue to discover interests as their education improves. They may begin to choose to do more \nactivities to pursue that interest, such as joining a sport if they know they have athletic ability, or joining the band if they are good at music. If not allowed to discover their own talents in their own time, they will develop a sense of lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and lethargy. They may become \"couch potatoes\" if they are not allowed to develop interests.\n\nThe adolescent is newly concerned with how they appear to others. Superego identity is the accrued confidence that the outer sameness and continuity prepared in the future are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for oneself, as evidenced in the promise of a career. The ability to settle on a school or occupational identity is pleasant. In later stages of adolescence, the child develops a sense of sexual identity. As they make the transition from childhood to adulthood, adolescents ponder the roles they will play in the adult world. Initially, they are apt to experience some role confusion—mixed ideas and feelings about the specific ways in which they will fit into society—and may experiment with a variety of behaviors and activities (e.g. tinkering with cars, baby-sitting for neighbors, affiliating with certain political or religious groups). Eventually, Erikson proposed, most adolescents achieve a sense of identity regarding who they are and where their lives are headed.\n\nThe teenager must achieve identity in occupation, gender roles, politics, and, in some cultures, religion.\n\nErikson is credited with coining the term \"identity crisis\". Each stage that came before and that follows has its own 'crisis', but even more so now, for this marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. This passage is necessary because \"Throughout infancy and childhood, a person forms many identifications. But the need for identity in youth is not met by these.\" This turning point in human development seems to be the reconciliation between 'the person one has come to be' and 'the person society expects one to become'. This emerging sense of self will be established by 'forging' past experiences with anticipations of the future. In relation to the eight life stages as a whole, the fifth stage corresponds to the crossroads:\n\nWhat is unique about the stage of Identity is that it is a special sort of synthesis of earlier stages and a special sort of anticipation of later ones. Youth has a certain unique quality in a person's life; it is a bridge between childhood and adulthood. Youth is a time of radical change—the great body changes accompanying puberty, the ability of the mind to search one's own intentions and the intentions of others, the suddenly sharpened awareness of the roles society has offered for later life.\n\nAdolescents \"are confronted by the need to re-establish boundaries for themselves and to do this in the face of an often potentially hostile world\". This is often challenging since commitments are being asked for before particular identity roles have formed. At this point, one is in a state of 'identity confusion', but society normally makes allowances for youth to \"find themselves\", and this state is called 'the moratorium':\n\nThe problem of adolescence is one of role confusion—a reluctance to commit which may haunt a person into his mature years. Given the right conditions—and Erikson believes these are essentially having enough space and time, a psychosocial moratorium, when a person can freely experiment and explore—what may emerge is a firm sense of identity, an emotional and deep awareness of who he or she is.\n\nAs in other stages, bio-psycho-social forces are at work. No matter how one has been raised, one's personal ideologies are now chosen for oneself. Often, this leads to conflict with adults over religious and political orientations. Another area where teenagers are deciding for themselves is their career choice, and often parents want to have a decisive say in that role. If society is too insistent, the teenager will acquiesce to external wishes, effectively forcing him or her to ‘foreclose' on experimentation and, therefore, true self-discovery. Once someone settles on a worldview and vocation, will he or she be able to integrate this aspect of self-definition into a diverse society? According to Erikson, when an adolescent has balanced both perspectives of \"What have I got?\" and \"What am I going to do with it?\" he or she has established their identity:\n\nDependent on this stage is the ego quality of \"fidelity—the ability to sustain loyalties freely pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions and confusions of value systems\". (Italics in original)\nGiven that the next stage (Intimacy) is often characterized by marriage, many are tempted to cap off the fifth stage at 20 years of age. However, these age ranges are actually quite fluid, especially for the achievement of identity, since it may take many years to become grounded, to identify the object of one's fidelity, to feel that one has \"come of age\". In the biographies \"Young Man Luther\" and \"Gandhi's Truth\", Erikson determined that their crises ended at ages 25 and 30, respectively:\n\nErikson does note that the time of Identity crisis for persons of genius is frequently prolonged. He further notes that in our industrial society, identity formation tends to be long, because it takes us so long to gain the skills needed for adulthood's tasks in our technological world. So… we do not have an exact time span in which to find ourselves. It doesn't happen automatically at eighteen or at twenty-one. A \"very\" approximate rule of thumb for our society would put the end somewhere in one's twenties.\n\nThe Intimacy vs. Isolation conflict is emphasized around the age of 30. At the start of this stage, identity vs. role confusion is coming to an end, though it still lingers at the foundation of the stage (Erikson, 1950). Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with friends. They want to fit in.\nErikson believes we are sometimes isolated due to intimacy. We are afraid of rejections such as being turned down or our partners breaking up with us. We are familiar with pain and to some of us rejection is so painful that our egos cannot bear it. Erikson also argues that \"Intimacy has a counterpart: Distantiation: the readiness to isolate and if necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose essence seems dangerous to our own, and whose territory seems to encroach on the extent of one's intimate relations\" (1950).\n\nOnce people have established their identities, they are ready to make long-term commitments to others. They become capable of forming intimate, reciprocal relationships (e.g. through close friendships or marriage) and willingly make the sacrifices and compromises that such relationships require. If people cannot form these intimate relationships—perhaps because of their own needs—a sense of isolation may result; arousing feelings of darkness and angst.\n\nGenerativity is the concern of guiding the next generation. Socially-valued work and disciplines are expressions of generativity. \n\nThe adult stage of generativity has broad application to family, relationships, work, and society. \"Generativity, then is primarily the concern in establishing and guiding the next generation... the concept is meant to include... productivity and creativity.\"\n\nDuring middle age the primary developmental task is one of contributing to society and helping to guide future generations. When a person makes a contribution during this period, perhaps by raising a family or working toward the betterment of society, a sense of generativity—a sense of productivity and accomplishment—results. In contrast, a person who is self-centered and unable or unwilling to help society move forward develops a feeling of stagnation—a dissatisfaction with the relative lack of productivity.\n\n\nAs we grow older and become senior citizens we tend to slow down our productivity and explore life as a retired person. It is during this time that we contemplate our accomplishments and are able to develop integrity if we see ourselves as leading a successful life. If we see our life as unproductive, or feel that we did not accomplish our life goals, we become dissatisfied with life and develop despair, often leading to depression and hopelessness.\n\nThe final developmental task is retrospection: people look back on their lives and accomplishments. They develop feelings of contentment and integrity if they believe that they have led a happy, productive life. They may instead develop a sense of despair if they look back on a life of disappointments and unachieved goals.\n\nThis stage can occur out of the sequence when an individual feels they are near the end of their life (such as when receiving a terminal disease diagnosis).\n\nJoan M. Erikson, who married and collaborated with Erik Erikson, added a ninth stage in \"The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version\". Living in the ninth stage, she wrote, \"old age in one's eighties and nineties brings with it new demands, reevaluations, and daily difficulties\". Addressing these new challenges requires \"designating a new ninth stage\". Erikson was ninety-three years old when she wrote about the ninth stage.\n\nJoan Erikson showed that all the eight stages \"are relevant and recurring in the ninth stage\". In the ninth stage, the psychosocial crises of the eight stages are faced again, but with the quotient order reversed. For example, in the first stage (infancy), the psychosocial crisis was \"Trust vs. Mistrust\" with Trust being the \"syntonic quotient\" and Mistrust being the \"dystonic\". Joan Erikson applies the earlier psychosocial crises to the ninth stage as follows:\n\n\"Basic Mistrust vs. Trust: Hope\"\nIn the ninth stage, \"elders are forced to mistrust their own capabilities\" because one's \"body inevitably weakens\". Yet, Joan Erikson asserts that \"while there is light, there is hope\" for a \"bright light and revelation\".\n\n\"Shame and Doubt vs. Autonomy: Will\"\nNinth stage elders face the \"shame of lost control\" and doubt \"their autonomy over their own bodies\". So it is that \"shame and doubt challenge cherished autonomy\".\n\n\"Inferiority vs. Industry: Competence\"\nIndustry as a \"driving force\" that elders once had is gone in the ninth stage. Being incompetent \"because of aging is belittling\" and makes elders \"like unhappy small children of great age\".\n\n\"Identity confusion vs. Identity: Fidelity\"\nElders experience confusion about their \"existential identity\" in the ninth stage and \"a real uncertainty about status and role\".\n\n\"Isolation vs. Intimacy: Love\"\nIn the ninth stage, the \"years of intimacy and love\" are often replaced by \"isolation and deprivation\". Relationships become \"overshadowed by new incapacities and dependencies\".\n\n\"Stagnation vs. Generativity: Care\"\nThe generativity in the seventh stage of \"work and family relationships\", if it goes satisfactorily, is \"a wonderful time to be alive\". In one's eighties and nineties, there is less energy for generativity or caretaking. Thus, \"a sense of stagnation may well take over\".\n\n\"Despair and Disgust vs. Integrity: Wisdom\"\nIntegrity imposes \"a serious demand on the senses of elders\". Wisdom requires capacities that ninth stage elders \"do not usually have\". The eighth stage includes retrospection that can evoke a \"degree of disgust and despair\". In the ninth stage, introspection is replaced by the attention demanded to one's \"loss of capacities and disintegration\".\n\nLiving in the ninth stage, Joan Erikson expressed confidence that the psychosocial crisis of the ninth stage can be met as in the first stage with the \"basic trust\" with which \"we are blessed\".\n\nErikson was a student of Anna Freud, the daughter of Sigmund Freud, whose psychoanalytic theory and psychosexual stages contributed to the basic outline of the eight stages, at least those concerned with childhood. Namely, the first four of Erikson's life stages correspond to Freud's oral, anal, phallic, and latency phases, respectively. Also, the fifth stage of adolescence is said to parallel the genital stage in psychosexual development:\n\nAlthough the first three phases are linked to those of the Freudian theory, it can be seen that they are conceived along very different lines. Emphasis is not so much on sexual modes and their consequences as on the ego qualities which emerge from each stages. There is an attempt also to link the sequence of individual development to the broader context of society.\n\nErikson saw a dynamic at work throughout life, one that did not stop at adolescence. He also viewed the life stages as a cycle: the end of one generation was the beginning of the next. Seen in its social context, the life stages were linear for an individual but circular for societal development:\n\nIn Freud's view, development is largely complete by adolescence. In contrast, one of Freud's students, Erik Erikson (1902–1994) believed that development continues throughout life. Erikson took the foundation laid by Freud and extended it through adulthood and into late life.\nErikson's theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential, and only occurring within the age ranges he suggests. There is debate as to whether people only search for identity during the adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed. However, Erikson states that each of these processes occur throughout the lifetime in one form or another, and he emphasizes these \"phases\" only because it is at these times that the conflicts become most prominent.\n\nMost empirical research into Erikson has related to his views on adolescence and attempts to establish identity. His theoretical approach was studied and supported, particularly regarding adolescence, by James E. Marcia. Marcia's work has distinguished different forms of identity, and there is some empirical evidence that those people who form the most coherent self-concept in adolescence are those who are most able to make intimate attachments in early adulthood. This supports the part of Eriksonian theory, that suggests that those best equipped to resolve the crisis of early adulthood are those who have most successfully resolved the crisis of adolescence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "951393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=951393", "title": "Filial piety", "text": "Filial piety\n\nIn Confucian philosophy, filial piety (, \"xiào\") is a virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors. The Confucian \"Classic of Filial Piety\", thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book, a purported dialogue between Confucius and his student Zengzi, is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. The term can also be applied to general obedience. Filial piety is central to Confucian role ethics.\n\nIn more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death.\n\nFilial piety is considered a key virtue in Chinese culture, and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is \"The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars\" (\"Ershi-si xiao\" ). These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese people.\n\nFilial piety is illustrated by the Chinese character \"xiao\" (孝). The character is a combination of the character \"lao\" (old) above the character \"zi\" (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son. In Korean Confucianism, the character is pronounced \"hyo\" (효). In Vietnamese, the character is written in Quoc Ngu as \"hiếu\". In Japanese, the term is generally used in spoken and written language as 親孝行, \"\"oyakōkō\",\" adding characters for \"parent\" and \"conduct\" to make the word more specific.\n\nAccording to the \"Classic of Filial Piety\", Confucius once said: \"In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity.\" For Confucius, filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents. More important than the norms of \"xiào\" were the norms of \"rén\" (仁; benevolence) and \"yì\" (義; righteousness). For Confucius and Mencius, \"xiào\" was a display of \"rén\" which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders, thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations. However, in practice, \"xiào\" was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents, and from time to time, was elevated above the notions of \"rén\" and \"yì\".\n\nFilial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state.\n\nBuddhism stressed \"individual\" salvation, and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China, which stressed the good of the \"community\" more than the good of the \"individual\". In India, Buddhism also advocated celibacy among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view, given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. The \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" (牟子理惑論), a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese, presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents, by closely reading the works of Confucius himself. The \"Guiyangtu\" (跪羊图) and Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation.\n\nThe \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning.\nA long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's life would have been lost in the waters.\nThe behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar. While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation. The \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of ascetic sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius. The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent’s soul is the most important one. The same essential argument was made later by Sun Chuo, who argued that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so. Huiyuan continued in this reasoning, arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk, then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives.\n\nThese philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct, and so less subtle methods were employed. To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. \"The story of Shanzi\" 睒子 (\"Syama\" in Sanskrit, Sama in Pāli, from the \"Sama Jātaka\"), is an example of this.\n\nShanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents, until he was accidentally killed. But, because of his life of filial devotion, he was miraculously revived. This story was often mentioned in the Chinese canon of Buddhist texts, and was included in a number of different anthologies (such as the \"Liudu Jijing\" and referred to by other Chinese Buddhist writers. While it is clearly of Indian origin based on the story of Shravan, this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales. While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings, philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism.\n\nAnother story advocating filial piety is that of Moggallāna, a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life. This story appeared in the \"Ullambana Sūtra\" and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tzǔ, though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism. In China, however, these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture, but also popular tales which were even told among non-Buddhists. While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one.\n\nAnother tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the Buddha rising to heaven for three months after his enlightenment to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy. This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents, in that he cared for their immortal souls.\n\nA number of apocryphal texts were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent-child relationship. The most important of these, the \"Sutra of Filial Piety\", was written early in the Tang dynasty. This text (\"sūtra\") has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child. In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect. Despite being a forgery, the \"sūtra\" was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners, and it played an important role in the development of a fully Chinese variation of Buddhism. Other documents discussing the Buddha’s views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries. The \"Sutra on a Filial Son\", for instance, also sounds far more Chinese than Indian, and shows Confucian influence.\n\nLu Xun in his collection \"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk\" (朝花夕拾) criticized the stories \"He Buried His Son for His Mother\" and \"Wang Xiang: He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp\". The latter story is about Wang Xiang, a very young boy, who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4599105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4599105", "title": "Four causes", "text": "Four causes\n\nThe \"four causes\" are elements of an influential principle in Aristotelian thought whereby explanations of change or movement are classified into four fundamental types of answer to the question \"why?\". Aristotle wrote that \"we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its why, that is to say, its cause.\" While there are cases where identifying a \"cause\" is difficult, or in which \"causes\" might merge, Aristotle held that his four \"causes\" provided an analytical scheme of general applicability.\n\nAitia, from Greek , was the word that Aristotle used to refer to the causal explanation that has traditionally been translated as \"cause\", but this specialized, technical, philosophical usage of the word \"cause\" does not correspond exactly to its most usual applications in everyday English language. The translation of Aristotle's that is nearest to current ordinary language could be \"question\" or \"causal explanation\", although any such terms may mask the fact that Aristotelians consider the four causes to be more fundamental in nature than mere explanations. In this article, the peculiar philosophical usage of the word \"cause\" will be employed, for tradition's sake, but the reader should not be misled by confusing this technical usage with current ordinary language.\n\nAristotle held that there were four kinds of answers to \"why\" questions (in \"Physics\" II, 3, and \"Metaphysics\" V, 2):\nThe four \"causes\" are not mutually exclusive. For Aristotle, several answers to the question \"why\" have to be given to explain a phenomenon and especially the actual configuration of an object. For example, if asking why a table is such and such, a complete explanation, taking into account the four causes, would sound like this: This table is solid and brown because it is made of wood (matter), it does not collapse because it has four legs of equal length (form), it is as such because a carpenter made it starting from a tree (agent), it has these dimensions because it is to be used by men and women (end).\n\nIn his philosophical writings, Aristotle used the Greek word αἴτιον, \"aition\", a neuter singular form of an adjective. The Greek word had meant, perhaps originally in a \"legal\" context, what or who is \"responsible\", mostly but not always in a bad sense of \"guilt\" or \"blame\"; alternatively it could mean \"to the credit of\" someone or something. The appropriation of this word by Aristotle and other philosophers reflects how the Greek experience of legal practice influenced the concern in Greek thought to determine \"what\" is responsible. The word developed other meanings, including its use in philosophy in a more abstract sense. About a century before Aristotle, the anonymous author of the Hippocratic text \"On Ancient Medicine\" had described the essential characteristics of a cause: \"We must, therefore, consider the causes of each [medical] condition to be those things which are such that, when they are present, the condition necessarily occurs, but when they change to another combination, it ceases.\" In the present context, Aristotle used the four causes to provide different answers to the question, \"because of what?\" The four answers to this question illuminate different aspects of how a thing comes into being or of how an event takes place.\n\nAristotle considers the material \"cause\" (\"hyle\") of an object as equivalent to the nature of the raw material out of which the object is composed. (The word \"nature\" for Aristotle applies to both its potential in the raw material and its ultimate finished form. In a sense this form already existed in the material: see potentiality and actuality.)\n\nWhereas modern physics looks to simple bodies, Aristotle's physics instead treated living things as exemplary. However, he felt that simple natural bodies such as earth, fire, air, and water also showed signs of having their own innate sources of motion, change, and rest. Fire, for example, carries things upwards, unless stopped from doing so. Things like beds and cloaks, formed by human artifice, have no innate tendency to become beds or cloaks.\n\nIn Aristotelian terminology, material is not the same as substance. Matter has parallels with substance in so far as primary matter serves as the substratum for simple bodies which are not substance: sand and rock (mostly earth), rivers and seas (mostly water), atmosphere and wind (mostly air and then mostly fire below the moon). Only individuals are said to be substance (subjects) in the primary sense. Secondary substance, in a different sense, also applies to man-made artifacts.\n\nAristotle considers the formal \"cause\" (\"eidos\") as describing the pattern or form which when present makes matter into a particular type of thing, which we recognize as being of that particular type.\n\nBy Aristotle's own account, this is a difficult and controversial concept. It links with theories of forms such as those of Aristotle's teacher, Plato, but in Aristotle's own account (see his \"Metaphysics\"), he takes into account many previous writers who had expressed opinions about forms and ideas, but he shows how his own views differ from them.\n\nAristotle defines the agent or efficient \"cause\" (\"kinoun\") of an object as that which causes change and motion to start or stop (such as a painter painting a house) (see Aristotle, Physics II 3, 194b29). In many cases, this is simply the thing that brings something about. For example, in the case of a statue, it is the person chiseling away which transforms a block of marble into a statue. Only this one of the four causes is like what an ordinary English-speaker would regard as a cause.\n\nAristotle defines the end, purpose, or final \"cause\" (\"telos\") as that for the sake of which a thing is done. Like the form, this is a controversial type of explanation in science; some have argued for its survival in evolutionary biology, while Ernst Mayr denied that it continued to play a role. It is commonly claimed that Aristotle's conception of nature is teleological in the sense that Nature has goals apart from those that humans have. On the other hand, as discussed further below, it has also been claimed that Aristotle thought that a \"telos\" can be present without any form of deliberation, consciousness or intelligence. An example of a relevant passage occurs in \"Physics\" II.8, where he writes:\n\nFor example, according to Aristotle, a seed has the eventual adult plant as its end (i.e., as its \"telos\") if and only if the seed would become the adult plant under normal circumstances. In \"Physics\" II.9, Aristotle hazards a few arguments that a determination of the end (cause) of a phenomenon is more important than the others. He argues that the end is that which brings it about, so for example \"if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron.\" According to Aristotle, once a final \"cause\" is in place, the material, efficient and formal \"causes\" follow by necessity. However, he recommends that the student of nature determine the other \"causes\" as well, and notes that not all phenomena have an end, e.g., chance events.\n\nAristotle saw that his biological investigations provided insights into the causes of things, especially into the final cause.\nGeorge Holmes Howison, in \"The Limits of Evolution\" (1901), highlights \"final causation\" in presenting his theory of metaphysics, which he terms \"personal idealism\", and to which he invites not only man, but all (ideal) life; at p. 39: \n\nHowever, Edward Feser argues, in line with the Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition, that finality has been greatly misunderstood. Indeed, without finality, efficient causality becomes inexplicable. Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end towards which a thing is ordered.\nWhen a match is rubbed against the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire.\nThe effect is not arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire which is realized through efficient causes.\n\nIn their theoretical study of organism, more specifically propagating organisation of process, Kauffman \"et al.\" remark (p30): \n\nFrancis Bacon wrote in his \"Advancement of Learning\" (1605) that natural science \"doth make inquiry, and take consideration of the same natures : but how? Only as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms.\" According to the demands of Bacon, apart from the \"laws of nature\" themselves, the causes relevant to natural science are only efficient causes and material causes in terms of Aristotle's classification, or to use the formulation which became famous later, all nature visible to human science is matter and motion. Using the terminology of Aristotle, he divided knowledge into physics and metaphysics in \"The New Organon\". From the two kinds of axioms which have been spoken of arises a just division of philosophy and the sciences, taking the received terms (which come nearest to express the thing) in a sense agreeable to my own views. Thus, let the investigation of forms, which are (in the eye of reason at least, and in their essential law) eternal and immutable, constitute Metaphysics; and let the investigation of the efficient cause, and of matter, and of the latent process, and the latent configuration (all of which have reference to the common and ordinary course of nature, not to her eternal and fundamental laws) constitute Physics. And to these let there be subordinate two practical divisions: to Physics, Mechanics; to Metaphysics, what (in a purer sense of the word) I call Magic, on account of the broadness of the ways it moves in, and its greater command over nature. Francis Bacon \"The New Organon\", Book II, Aphorism 9, 1620\n\nBacon's position became the standard one for modern science.\n\nExplanations in terms of final causes remain common in evolutionary biology. Francisco J. Ayala has claimed that teleology is indispensable to biology since the concept of adaptation is inherently teleological. In an appreciation of Charles Darwin published in \"Nature\" in 1874, Asa Gray noted \"Darwin's great service to Natural Science\" lies in bringing back Teleology \"so that, instead of Morphology \"versus\" Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology\". Darwin quickly responded, \"What you say about Teleology pleases me especially and I do not think anyone else has ever noticed the point.\" Francis Darwin and T. H. Huxley reiterate this sentiment. The latter wrote that \"..the most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which his view offers.\" James G. Lennox states that Darwin uses the term 'Final Cause' consistently in his \"Species Notebook\", \"Origin of Species\" and after.\n\nContrary to the position described by Francisco J. Ayala, Ernst Mayr states that \"adaptedness... is \"a posteriori\" result rather than an a priori goal-seeking.\" Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of shorthand. For example, S. H. P. Madrell writes that \"the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements\" for the sake of saving space, but that this \"should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection.\" However, Lennox states that in evolution as conceived by Darwin, it is true both that evolution is the result of mutations arising by chance and that evolution is teleological in nature.\n\nStatements that a species does something \"in order to\" achieve survival are teleological. The validity or invalidity of such statements depends on the species and the intention of the writer as to the meaning of the phrase \"in order to\". Sometimes it is possible or useful to rewrite such sentences so as to avoid teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology even if that is not the intention.\n\nIn \"The Question Concerning Technology\", Martin Heidegger describes the four causes as follows:\n\n\nHeidegger explains it thus:\n\nThe educationist David Waddington comments that although the efficient cause, which he identifies as \"the craftsman\", might be thought the most significant of the four, in his view each of Heidegger's four causes is \"equally co-responsible\" for producing a craft item, in Heidegger's terms \"bringing forth\" the thing into existence. Waddington cites Lovitt's description of this bringing forth as \"a unified process\".\n\nTinbergen's four questions, named after the ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and based on Aristotle's four causes, are complementary categories of explanations for animal behaviour. They are also commonly referred to as levels of analysis. The four questions are on function, what an adaptation does that is selected for in evolution; phylogeny, the evolutionary history of an organism, revealing its relationships to other species; mechanism, namely the proximate cause of a behaviour, such as the role of testosterone in aggression; and ontogeny, the development of an organism from egg to embryo to adult.\n\n"}
{"id": "12859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12859", "title": "Golden Rule", "text": "Golden Rule\n\nThe Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as one's self would wish to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in many religions and cultures.\n\nThe Golden Rule can be considered an ethic of reciprocity in some religions, although other religions treat it differently. The maxim may appear as either a positive or negative injunction governing conduct:\n\n\nThe idea dates at least to the early Confucian times (551–479 BCE) according to Rushworth Kidder, who identifies that this concept appears prominently in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, and \"the rest of the world's major religions\". The concept of the Rule is codified in the Code of Hammurabi stele and tablets, 1754-1790 BCE. 143 leaders encompassing the world's major faiths endorsed the Golden Rule as part of the 1993 \"Declaration Toward a Global Ethic\", including the Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian. According to Greg M. Epstein, \" 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely,\" but belief in God is not necessary to endorse it. Simon Blackburn also states that the Golden Rule can be \"found in some form in almost every ethical tradition\". \n\nYet, as with any historically prominent maxim, the Golden Rule is not without its controversy (as seen in the Criticism section below). \nThe term \"Golden Rule\", or \"Golden law\", began to be used widely in the early 17th century in Britain by Anglican theologians and preachers; the earliest known usage is that of Anglicans Charles Gibbon and Thomas Jackson in 1604.\n\nPossibly the earliest affirmation of the maxim of reciprocity, reflecting the ancient Egyptian goddess Ma'at, appears in the story of The Eloquent Peasant, which dates to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040–1650 BC): \"Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do.\" This proverb embodies the \"do ut des\" principle. A Late Period (c. 664–323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: \"That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another.\"\n\nIn \"Mahābhārata\", the ancient epic of India, there is a discourse in which the wise minister Vidura advises the King Yuddhiśhṭhira\nIn Chapter 32 in the Part on Virtue of the Tirukkuṛaḷ (c. 200 BC – c. 500 AD), Tiruvalluvar says: \"Do not do to others what you know has hurt yourself\" (K. 316.); \"Why does one hurt others knowing what it is to be hurt?\" (K. 318). He furthermore opined that it is the determination of the spotless (virtuous) not to do evil, even in return, to those who have cherished enmity and done them evil. (K. 312) The (proper) punishment to those who have done evil (to you), is to put them to shame by showing them kindness, in return and to forget both the evil and the good done on both sides (K. 314)\n\nThe Golden Rule in its prohibitive (negative) form was a common principle in ancient Greek philosophy. Examples of the general concept include:\n\nThe Pahlavi Texts of Zoroastrianism (c. 300 BC–1000 AD) were an early source for the Golden Rule: \"That nature alone is good which refrains from doing to another whatsoever is not good for itself.\" Dadisten-I-dinik, 94,5, and \"Whatever is disagreeable to yourself do not do unto others.\" Shayast-na-Shayast 13:29\n\nSeneca the Younger (c. 4 BC–65 AD), a practitioner of Stoicism (c. 300 BC–200 AD) expressed the Golden Rule in his essay regarding the treatment of slaves: \"Treat your inferior as you would wish your superior to treat you.\"\n\nAccording to Simon Blackburn, the Golden Rule \"can be found in some form in almost every ethical tradition\". \n\nA rule of altruistic reciprocity was first stated positively in a well-known Torah verse (Hebrew: ):\nHillel the Elder (c. 110 BC – 10 AD), used this verse as a most important message of the Torah for his teachings. Once, he was challenged by a gentile who asked to be converted under the condition that the Torah be explained to him while he stood on one foot. Hillel accepted him as a candidate for conversion to Judaism but, drawing on , briefed the man:\nHillel recognized brotherly love as the fundamental principle of Jewish ethics. Rabbi Akiva agreed and suggested that the principle of love must have its foundation in Genesis chapter 1, which teaches that all men are the offspring of Adam, who was made in the image of God (Sifra, Ḳedoshim, iv.; Yer. Ned. ix. 41c; Genesis Rabba 24). According to Jewish rabbinic literature, the first man Adam represents the \"unity of mankind\". This is echoed in the modern preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And it is also taught, that Adam is last in order according to the evolutionary character of God's creation:Why was only a single specimen of man created first? To teach us that he who destroys a single soul destroys a whole world and that he who saves a single soul saves a whole world; furthermore, so no race or class may claim a nobler ancestry, saying, 'Our father was born first'; and, finally, to give testimony to the greatness of the Lord, who caused the wonderful diversity of mankind to emanate from one type. And why was Adam created last of all beings? To teach him humility; for if he be overbearing, let him remember that the little fly preceded him in the order of creation.\n\nThe Jewish Publication Society's edition of Leviticus states:Thou shalt not hate thy brother. in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him. 18 Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.This Torah verse represents one of several versions of the \"Golden Rule\", which itself appears in various forms, positive and negative. It is the earliest written version of that concept in a positive form.\n\nAt the turn of the eras, the Jewish rabbis were discussing the scope of the meaning of Leviticus 19:18 and 19:34 extensively:\n\nCommentators summed up foreigners (= Samaritans), proselytes (= 'strangers who resides with you') (Rabbi Akiva, bQuid 75b) or Jews (Rabbi Gamaliel, yKet 3, 1; 27a) to the scope of the meaning.\n\nOn the verse, \"Love your fellow as yourself,\" the classic commentator Rashi quotes from Torat Kohanim, an early Midrashic text regarding the famous dictum of Rabbi Akiva: \"Love your fellow as yourself – Rabbi Akiva says this is a great principle of the Torah.\"\n\nIsrael's postal service quoted from the previous Leviticus verse when it commemorated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on a 1958 postage stamp.\n\nThe \"Golden Rule\" was given by Jesus of Nazareth (Matthew 7:12 NCV, see also ). The common English phrasing is \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583).\nThe Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the Old Testament: (\"Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.\"; see also Great Commandment) and (\"But treat them just as you treat your own citizens. Love foreigners as you love yourselves, because you were foreigners one time in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.\").\n\nThe Old Testament Deuterocanonical books of Tobit and Sirach, accepted as part of the Scriptural canon by Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Non-Chalcedonian Churches, express a negative form of the golden rule:\n\nTwo passages in the New Testament quote Jesus of Nazareth espousing the positive form of the Golden rule:\n\nA similar passage, a parallel to the Great Commandment, is \n\nThe passage in the book of Luke then continues with Jesus answering the question, \"Who is my neighbor?\", by telling the parable of the Good Samaritan, indicating that \"your neighbor\" is anyone in need. This extends to all, including those who are generally considered hostile.\n\nJesus' teaching goes beyond the negative formulation of not doing what one would not like done to themselves, to the positive formulation of actively doing good to another that, if the situations were reversed, one would desire that the other would do for them. This formulation, as indicated in the parable of the Good Samaritan, emphasizes the needs for positive action that brings benefit to another, not simply restraining oneself from negative activities that hurt another.\n\nIn one passage of the New Testament, Paul the Apostle refers to the golden rule:\n\nThe Arabian peninsula was known to not practice the golden rule prior to the advent of Islam. \"Pre-Islamic Arabs regarded the survival of the tribe, as most essential and to be ensured by the ancient rite of blood vengeance\"\n\nHowever, this all changed when Muhammad came on the scene:\n\nFrom the hadith, the collected oral and written accounts of Muhammad and his teachings during his lifetime:\n\nAli ibn Abi Talib (4th Caliph in Sunni Islam, and first Imam in Shia Islam) says:\nThe writings of the Bahá'í Faith encourages everyone to treat others as they would treat themselves and even prefer others over oneself:\n\nAlso,\nBuddha (Siddhartha Gautama, c. 623–543 BC) made this principle one of the cornerstones of his ethics in the 6th century BC. It occurs in many places and in many forms throughout the Tripitaka.\n\nThe Golden Rule is paramount in the Jainist philosophy and can be seen in the doctrines of Ahimsa and Karma. As part of the prohibition of causing any living beings to suffer, Jainism forbids inflicting upon others what is harmful to oneself.\n\nThe following quotation from the Acaranga Sutra sums up the philosophy of Jainism:\n\nSaman Suttam of Jinendra Varni gives further insight into this precept:-\n\nThe same idea is also presented in V.12 and VI.30 of the \"Analects\" (c. 500 BC), which can be found in the online Chinese Text Project. The phraseology differs from the Christian version of the Golden Rule. It does not presume to do anything unto others, but merely to avoid doing what would be harmful. It does not preclude doing good deeds and taking moral positions, but there is slim possibility for a Confucian missionary outlook, such as one can justify with the Christian Golden Rule.\n\nMozi regarded the golden rule as a corollary to the cardinal virtue of impartiality, and encouraged egalitarianism and selflessness in relationships.\n\nDo not do unto others whatever is injurious to yourself. -- Shayast-na-Shayast 13.29\n\nThe Way to Happiness expresses the Golden Rule both in its negative/prohibitive form and in its positive form. The negative/prohibitive form is expressed in Precept 19 as:\n\nThe positive form is expressed in Precept 20 as:\n\nThe \"Declaration Toward a Global Ethic\" from the Parliament of the World’s Religions (1993) proclaimed the Golden Rule (\"We must treat others as we wish others to treat us\") as the common principle for many religions. The Initial Declaration was signed by 143 leaders from all of the world's major faiths, including Baha'i Faith, Brahmanism, Brahma Kumaris, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Indigenous, Interfaith, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Native American, Neo-Pagan, Sikhism, Taoism, Theosophist, Unitarian Universalist and Zoroastrian. In the folklore of several cultures the Golden Rule is depicted by the allegory of the long spoons.\n\nIn the view of Greg M. Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, \" 'do unto others' ... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely. \"But not a single one of these versions of the golden rule requires a God\"\". Various sources identify the Golden Rule as a humanist principle:\n\nAccording to Marc H. Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others.\n\nHowever Leo Damrosch argued that the notion that the Golden Rule pertains to \"rights\" per se is a contemporary interpretation and has nothing to do with its origin. The development of human \"rights\" is a modern political ideal that began as a philosophical concept promulgated through the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau in 18th century France, among others. His writings influenced Thomas Jefferson, who then incorporated Rousseau's reference to \"inalienable rights\" into the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Damrosch argued that to confuse the Golden Rule with human rights is to apply contemporary thinking to ancient concepts.\n\nThere has been research published arguing that some 'sense' of fair play and the Golden Rule may be stated and rooted in terms of neuroscientific and neuroethical principles.\n\nThe Golden Rule can also be explained from the perspectives of psychology, philosophy, sociology, human evolution, and economics. Psychologically, it involves a person empathizing with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor also as \"I\" or \"self\". Sociologically, \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups. In evolution, \"reciprocal altruism\" is seen as a distinctive advance in the capacity of human groups to survive and reproduce, as their exceptional brains demanded exceptionally long childhoods and ongoing provision and protection even beyond that of the immediate family. In economics, Richard Swift, referring to ideas from David Graeber, suggests that \"without some kind of reciprocity society would no longer be able to exist.\"\n\nPhilosophers, such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche, have objected to the rule on a variety of grounds. The most serious among these is its application. How does one know how others want to be treated? The obvious way is to ask them, but this cannot be done if one assumes they have not reached a particular and relevant understanding.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote, \"Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you. Their tastes may be different.\" This suggests that if your values are not shared with others, the way you want to be treated will not be the way they want to be treated. Hence, the Golden Rule of \"do unto others\" is \"dangerous in the wrong hands,\" according to philosopher Iain King, because \"some fanatics have no aversion to death: the Golden Rule might inspire them to kill others in suicide missions.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant famously criticized the golden rule for not being sensitive to differences of situation, noting that a prisoner duly convicted of a crime could appeal to the golden rule while asking the judge to release him, pointing out that the judge would not want anyone else to send him to prison, so he should not do so to others. Kant's \"Categorical Imperative\", introduced in \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\", is often confused with the Golden Rule.\n\nIn his book \"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\", philosopher Iain King has argued that \"(although) the idea of mirroring your treatment of others with their treatment of you is very widespread indeed… most ancient wisdoms express this negatively – advice on what you should not do, rather than what you should.\" He argues this creates a bias in favour of inertia which allows bad actions and states of affairs to persist. The positive formulation, meanwhile, can be \"incendiary\", since it \"can lead to cycles of tit-for-tat reciprocity,\" unless it is accompanied by a corrective mechanism, such as a concept of forgiveness. Therefore, he concludes that there can be no viable formulation of the Golden Rule, unless it is heavily qualified by other maxims.\n\nWalter Terence Stace, in \"The Concept of Morals\" (1937), wrote:\n\nMarcus George Singer observed that there are two importantly different ways of looking at the golden rule: as requiring (1) that you perform specific actions that you want others to do to you or (2) that you guide your behavior in the same general ways that you want others to. Counter-examples to the golden rule typically are more forceful against the first than the second.\n\nIn his book on the golden rule, Jeffrey Wattles makes the similar observation that such objections typically arise while applying the golden rule in certain general ways (namely, ignoring differences in taste, in situation, and so forth). But if we apply the golden rule to our own method of using it, asking in effect if we would want other people to apply the golden rule in such ways, the answer would typically be no, since it is quite predictable that others' ignoring of such factors will lead to behavior which we object to. It follows that we should not do so ourselves—according to the golden rule. In this way, the golden rule may be self-correcting. An article by Jouni Reinikainen develops this suggestion in greater detail.\n\nIt is possible, then, that the golden rule can itself guide us in identifying which differences of situation are morally relevant. We would often want other people to ignore any prejudice against our race or nationality when deciding how to act towards us, but would also want them to not ignore our differing preferences in food, desire for aggressiveness, and so on. This principle of \"doing unto others, wherever possible, as \"they\" would be done by...\" has sometimes been termed the platinum rule.\n\nCharles Kingsley's \"The Water Babies\" (1863) includes a character named Mrs Do-As-You-Would-Be-Done-By (and another, Mrs Be-Done-By-As-You-Did).\n\n\n"}

The line does not constitute a legally international boundary but it is a de facto border, designated in 1948 as a cease-fire line, it divided Kashmir into two parts and closed the Jehlum valley route, the only entrance of the Kashmir Valley. This territorial division which, to this day still exists severed many villages and separated family members from each other. The landmines planted by the Army alongsides of the line have killed scores of innocent people and left thousands as disabled. Without compensation, these disabled persons in the Indian Kashmir are fighting for the survival.\n\nDuring 2008 Kashmir unrest, the Hindu extremist groups and the supporters of Bharatiya Janata Party blocked the Srinagar-Jammu National highway (NH 1A). The only national highway which connects Kashmir Valley to the rest of India remained closed for several days and stopped the supply of essential commodities. In response to the blockade, on 11 August 2008, under the leadership of Sheikh Abdul Aziz, 50,000 to 2,50,000 Kashmiri protesters attempted to cross the Line of Control to Muzaffarabad. The protesters were stopped at Uri which resulted in killing of fifteen people and hundreds injured when police and Indian paramilitary forces fired on them. A slogan raised by the protesters was, \"Khooni lakir tod do aar paar jod do\" (Break down the blood-soaked Line of Control let Kashmir be united again).\n\nHuman rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir, a disputed territory administered by India, are an ongoing issue. The allegations range from mass killings, forced disappearances, torture, rape and sexual abuse to political repression and suppression of freedom of speech. Many number of massacres have taken place in the region since 1990. The Indian Army, Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security personnel and various militant groups have been accused and held accountable for committing severe human rights abuses against Kashmiri civilians. A WikiLeaks issue accused India of systemic human rights abuses, it stated that US diplomats possessed evidence of the apparent widespread use of torture by Indian police and security forces.\n\nIn September 1990 the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was enacted in Jammu and Kashmir after passing in the Parliament of India to handle the rise in . Human rights group Amnesty claim that the special powers under (AFSPA) gives the security force immunity from alleged violations committed, and condemn it. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay has urged India to repeal AFSPA and to investigate the disappearances in Kashmir.\n\nOn 26 February 2009 the Chief Minister stated the act should be repealed, the security forces however said that revoking the act would be detrimental to security and help terrorist moral, though the militancy has declined the act is still in force International NGO's as well as the US state department have documented excesses such as disappearances, torture and arbitrary executions carried out during India's counter terrorism operations.\n\nHuman rights watch has also accused the Indian security forces of using children as spies and messengers, India army have targeted reporters and human rights activists, they have also been accused of committing over 200 rapes in an attempt to intimidate the local population. Wikileaks cables are reported to contain material stating that the International Committee of the Red Cross briefed US officials in India, alleging that India \"condoned\" torture and that \"sexual penetration\" formed part of the maltreatment of victims. The ICRC alleged that of the 1296 detainees interviewed, 681 had reported of being tortured. Of those, 304 individuals complained of sexual torture/abuse.\n\nIn 2005 Médecins Sans Frontières conducted a survey in Kashmir which found that the number of people who had witnessed a rape in Kashmir since 1989 was comparably far higher than the number of people who had witnessed a rape in other conflict zones such as Chechnya and Sri Lanka. The survey found that 13% of respondents had witnessed rape and 11.6% of the interviewees had themselves been victims of sexual abuse since 1989. Dr Seema Kazi states that rapes committed by Indian security forces outstrips the rapes committed by militants in both scale and frequency. Professor William Baker stated at the 52nd United Nations Commission on Human Rights that rape in Kashmir was an active strategy of the Indian forces to humiliate Kashmiri people.\n\nIn April 2002, authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir arrested three Indian paramilitary soldiers following the gang rape of 17-year-old girl. In July 2011, there were anti-India protests in Srinagar against the alleged rape of a 25-year-old village woman in the village of Manzgam.\n\nIn October 2011, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir apologised for the release of names, parentages and addresses of 1400 rape victims. However, no details were revealed as to whether the rapes were by security forces, militants or part of crime. Liaquat Ali Khan, an academic writer considers that these excesses in Kashmir do not have official sanction but are easy to commit because of the powers, to cordon and search villages and suburbs, that are vested to security forces by the law. The authorities use association with terrorists to discredit the testimony of the victims, in case the association is established. The security forces have carried out extrajudicial killings, assaults and other human rights violations. An investigation by the Jammu and Kashmir state human rights commission has found 2730 bodies in unmarked graves at 38 sites in northern Kashmir. At least 574 of these were identified as being local people.\n\nThe rapes by Islamic militants have been reported since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. On 22 October 1947, Pashtun militants invaded Baramulla in a Pakistan army truck, and raped women including European nuns. In March 1990, the wife of a BSF inspector was kidnapped, tortured and gang-raped for many days. Then her body with broken limbs was abandoned on a road. On April 14, 1990, a Kashmiri Pandit nurse from the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences in Srinagar was gang-raped and then beaten to death by terrorists. Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) took responsibility for the crime, accusing Bhat of informing the police about the presence of militants in the hospital. On 6 June 1990, a lab assistant at the Government Girls High School Trehgam, was kidnapped and gang raped for many days. Then she was sliced at a sawmill.\n\nPrana Ganjoo was abducted with her husband in Sopore. She was gang-raped for a number of days before the both were killed in November 1990.\n\nSince 1991, reports of rape by Islamic militants have increased, and there have been many cases of the militants threatening to kill the family unless a woman is handed over to the militants. According to the HRW, the rape victims of militants suffer ostracism and there is a \"code of silence and fear\" that prevents people from reporting such abuse. According to the HRW, the investigation of case of rape by militants is difficult because many Kashmiris are reluctant to discuss it for the fear of violent reprisals.\nThe increase in number of rape cases has resulted in an increased number of abortions, leading to one case of murder of doctor. The doctor was accused of being an informer by the Islamic groups Hezb-ul Mujahidin and Al Jehad.\nIn January 1991, a women was forcibly asked to \"marry\" a militant. Her brother was killed when the family refused, and the girl was taken away.\nOn 30 March 1992, armed militants demanded food and shelter from the family of the retired truck driver in Nai Sadak, Kralkhud. The family complied, but the militants killed the owner and raped his daughter and wife. Then both the women were also shot dead.\nAnother women was forced to marry the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen commander Farooq Ansari in Kishtwar in 2000. In 2005, a 14-year-old Gujjar girl was abducted from Lurkoti village by the Lashkar-e-Taiba militants, and forced to marry one of them. She was gang-raped by her \"husband\" and his militant friends. In December 2005, 15-year-old of Bajoni (Doda district) was forced to marry a Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militant, after her family was threatened with death. Periodic reports by Amnesty, International Commission of Jurists, Human Rights Watch and the US state department have documented massive human rights violations by militant groups supported by Pakistan.\n\nDuring the eruption of militancy in Kashmir valley, terrorism by majority sect has specifically targeted the Hindu Kashmiri Pandits minority and violated their human rights. Reports by Indian government state 219 Kashmiri pandits were killed and around 140,000 migrated due to militancy while over 3000 stayed in the valley. Reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists confirmed Indian reports of systematic human rights violations by Pakistan-backed militants.\n\nAccording to a report published by \"Asia Watch\": \n\nAccording to a resolution passed by the United States Congress in 2006, Islamic terrorists infiltrated the region in 1989 and forced most of the Kashmiri Pandits to flee Kashmir. According to the report, the population of Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir had declined from 400,000 in 1989 to 4,000 in 2011.\n\nThese groups targeted the Hindus in the Kashmir valley forcing an estimated 100,000 to flee.\n\nThe Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front have been accused of ethnic cleansing by using murder, arson and rape as a weapon of war to drive out hundreds of thousands of Pandits from the region. On 25 January 1998, 23 Kashmiri Pandits, including nine women and four young children living in the village of Wandhama, were killed by unknown persons wearing the uniforms of Indian Army soldiers, who had tea with them, waiting for a radio message indicating that all Pandit families in the village had been covered. Thereafter, they rounded up all the members of the Hindu households and then summarily gunned them down with Kalashnikov rifles.\n\nHindu civilians have been subjected to rape and murder perpetrated by members of terrorist organisations like the JKLF and the Hizbul Mujahideen. Muslim civilians who are considered political opponents of terrorists or those who are believed to be informers have also been raped or murdered.\n\nPakistan, an Islamic Republic, imposes multiple restrictions on peoples' religious freedom. Religious minorities also face unofficial economic and societal discrimination and have been targets of sectarian violence.\nThe constitution of Azad Kashmir specifically prohibits activities that may be prejudicial to the state's accession to Pakistan, and as such regularly suppresses demonstrations against the government. A number of Islamist militant groups operate in this area including Al-Qaeda, with tacit permission from Pakistan's intelligence. \n\nThere have been allegations of human rights abuse. A report titled \"Kashmir: Present Situation and Future Prospects\", which was submitted to the European Parliament by Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, was critical of the lack of human rights, justice, democracy, and Kashmiri representation in the Pakistan National Assembly. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence operates in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and is involved in extensive surveillance, arbitrary arrests, torture, and murder. Generally this is done with impunity and perpetrators go unpunished. The 2008 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determined that Pakistan-administered Kashmir was 'Not free'. According to Shaukat Ali Kashmiri, chairman of the International Kashmir Alliance, \"On one hand Pakistan claims to be the champion of the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people, but she has denied the same rights under its controlled parts of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan\".\n\nIn December 2009, activists of nationalist Kashmiri groups staged a protest in Muzaffarabad to condemn the alleged rigging of elections and killing of an 18-year-old student during the elections. The killing had led to widespread protests in the district.\n\nLarge protests erupted during the February 2012 Kohistan Killings where 18 people were ordered off from a bus and killed by gunmen on the Islamabad-Gilgit route. The act drew condemnation from the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nThe main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is a constitutional status to the region as a fifth province of Pakistan. However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to the 1948 UN resolution. In 2007, International Crisis Group stated that \"Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream. The region's inhabitants are embittered by Islamabad's unwillingness to devolve powers in real terms to its elected representatives. The rise of sectarian extremism is an alarming consequence of this denial of basic political rights\". A two-day conference on Gilgit-Baltistan was held on 8–9 April 2008 at the European Parliament in Brussels under the auspices of the International Kashmir Alliance. Several members of the European Parliament expressed concern over the human rights violation in Gilgit-Baltistan and urged the government of Pakistan to establish democratic institutions and rule of law in the area.\nIn 2009, the Pakistan government implemented an autonomy package for Gilgit-Baltistan which entails rights similar to those of Pakistan’s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such a status constitutionally. The direct rule by Islamabad is replaced by an elected legislative assembly and its chief minister.\nThere has been criticism and opposition to this move in Pakistan, India, and Pakistan administrated Kashmir. The move has been dubbed as an eyewash to hide the real mechanics of power, which allegedly are under the direct control of the Pakistani federal government. The package was opposed by Pakistani Kashmiri politicians who claimed that the integration of Gilgit-Baltistan into Pakistan would undermine their case for the independence of Kashmir from India. 300 activists from Kashmiri groups protested during the first Gilgit-Baltistan legislative assembly elections, with some carrying banners reading \"Pakistan's expansionist designs in Gilgit-Baltistan are unacceptable\". However, many people of Gilgit-Baltistan oppose integration into Kashmir. They want their region to be merged into Pakistan as a separate province.\n\n"}
{"id": "54057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54057", "title": "IS–LM model", "text": "IS–LM model\n\nThe IS–LM model, or Hicks–Hansen model, is a macroeconomic tool that shows the relationship between interest rates (ordinate) and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market, as abscissa). The intersection of the \"investment–saving\" (IS) and \"liquidity preference–money supply\" (LM) curves models \"general equilibrium\" where supposed simultaneous equilibrium occurs in both interest and assets markets. Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS–LM model explains changes in national income when price level is fixed short-run; second, the IS–LM model shows why an aggregate demand curve can shift.\nHence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies.\n\nThe model was developed by John Hicks in 1937, and later extended by Alvin Hansen, as a mathematical representation of Keynesian macroeconomic theory. Between the 1940s and mid-1970s, it was the leading framework of macroeconomic analysis. While it has been largely absent from macroeconomic research ever since, it is still a backbone conceptual introductory tool in many macroeconomics textbooks.\n\nThe IS–LM model was first introduced at a conference of the Econometric Society held in Oxford during September 1936. Roy Harrod, John R. Hicks, and James Meade all presented papers\ndescribing mathematical models attempting to summarize John Maynard Keynes' \"General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money\". Hicks, who had seen a draft of Harrod's paper, invented the IS–LM model (originally using the abbreviation \"LL\", not \"LM\"). He later presented it in\n\"Mr. Keynes and the Classics: A Suggested Interpretation\".\n\nHicks later agreed that the model missed important points of Keynesian theory, criticizing it as having very limited use beyond \"a classroom gadget\", and criticizing equilibrium methods generally: \"When one turns to questions of policy, looking towards the future instead of the past, the use of equilibrium methods is still more suspect.\" The first problem was that it presents the real and monetary sectors as separate, something Keynes attempted to transcend. In addition, an equilibrium model ignores uncertainty—and that liquidity preference only makes sense in the presence of uncertainty \"For there is no sense in liquidity, unless expectations are uncertain.\" A shift in one of the IS or LM curves will cause a change in expectations, which shifts the other curve.\n\nAlthough generally accepted as being imperfect, the model is seen as a useful pedagogical tool for imparting an understanding of the questions that macroeconomists today attempt to answer through more nuanced approaches. As such, it is included in most undergraduate macroeconomics textbooks, but omitted from most graduate texts due to the current dominance of real business cycle and new Keynesian theories.\n\nThe model is presented as a graph of two intersecting lines in the first quadrant.\n\nThe horizontal axis represents national income or real gross domestic product and is labelled \"Y.\" The vertical axis represents the real interest rate, \"r.\" Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between the nominal interest rate and the real interest rate (the former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is exogenous in the short run); therefore variables such as money demand which actually depend on the nominal interest rate can equivalently be expressed as depending on the real interest rate.\n\nThe point where these schedules intersect represents a short-run equilibrium in the real and monetary sectors (though not necessarily in other sectors, such as labor markets): both the product market and the money market are in equilibrium. This equilibrium yields a unique combination of the interest rate and real GDP.\n\nFor the investment-saving curve, the independent variable is the interest rate and the dependent variable is the level of income. (Note that scientific graphs typically place the independent variable—interest rate, in this example—on the vertical axis while the dependent variable is measured with the horizontal axis.) The IS curve is drawn as downward-sloping with the interest rate (i) on the vertical axis and GDP (gross domestic product: Y) on the horizontal axis. The initials IS stand for \"Investment and Saving equilibrium\" but since 1937 have been used to represent the locus of all equilibria where total spending (consumer spending + planned private investment + government purchases + net exports) equals an economy's total output (equivalent to real income, Y, or GDP). To keep the link with the historical meaning, the IS curve can be said to represent the equilibria where total private investment equals total saving, where the latter equals consumer saving \"plus\" government saving (the budget surplus) \"plus\" foreign saving (the trade surplus). In equilibrium, all spending is desired or planned; there is no unplanned inventory accumulation. The level of real GDP (Y) is determined along this line for each interest rate.\n\nThus the IS curve is a locus of points of equilibrium in the \"real\" (non-financial) economy. Each point on the curve represents the equilibrium between the Savings and Investment (S=I).\n\nGiven expectations about returns on fixed investment, every level of the real interest rate (i) will generate a certain level of planned fixed investment and other interest-sensitive spending: lower interest rates encourage higher fixed investment and the like. Income is at the equilibrium level for a given interest rate when the saving that consumers and other economic participants choose to do out of this income equals investment (or, equivalently, when \"leakages\" from the circular flow equal \"injections\"). The multiplier effect of an increase in fixed investment resulting from a lower interest rate raises real GDP. This explains the downward slope of the IS curve. In summary, this line represents the causation from falling interest rates to rising planned fixed investment (etc.) to rising national income and output.\n\nThe IS curve is defined by the equation\nwhere Y represents income, formula_2 represents consumer spending as an increasing function of disposable income (income, Y, minus taxes, T(Y), which themselves depend positively on income), formula_3 represents investment as a decreasing function of the real interest rate, G represents government spending, and NX(Y) represents net exports (exports minus imports) as a decreasing function of income (decreasing because imports are an increasing function of income).\n\nIn this model, the level of C (consumption), G (government spending), EX (exports), IM (imports), and R (real interest rate) are considered to be exogenous, meaning that they are taken as a given, because they are determined by factors outside of this model. Their equations are as follows: C = ā Ȳ , G = ā Ỹ , EX = ā Ȳ , and IM = ā Ȳ. I (investment) is endogenous, meaning that it is explained by our model, and has the equation I = (ā Ȳ) − b (R − ṝ) Ȳ , where ṝ is the marginal product of capital, R is the real interest rate, ā is the share of potential output that goes toward investment, and b is a constant. A few equations are necessary in order to derive the IS curve: ā = ā + ā + ā + ā - ā - 1, and Ỹ = (Y - Ȳ) / Ȳ = (Y / Ȳ) - (Ȳ / Ȳ) = (Y / Ȳ) - 1. When you plug in all the equations into the original Y = C + I + G + EX - IM and solve, you will get the short run output, which is Ỹ = ā - b (R - ṝ).\n\nFor the liquidity preference and money supply curve, the independent variable is \"income\" and the dependent variable is \"the interest rate.\" The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which the money market is in equilibrium. It is an upward-sloping curve representing the role of finance and money.\n\nThe LM function is the set of equilibrium points between the liquidity preference (or demand for money) function and the money supply function (as determined by banks and central banks).\n\nEach point on the LM curve reflects a particular equilibrium situation in the money market equilibrium diagram, based on a particular level of income. In the money market equilibrium diagram, the liquidity preference function is simply the willingness to hold cash balances instead of securities. For this function, the nominal interest rate (on the vertical axis) is plotted against the quantity of cash balances (or liquidity), on the horizontal. The liquidity preference function is downward sloping. Two basic elements determine the quantity of cash balances demanded (liquidity preference) and therefore the position and slope of the function:\n\nThe money supply function for this situation is plotted on the same graph as the liquidity preference function. The money supply is determined by the central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money. Though the money supply is related indirectly to interest rates in the very short run, the money supply in effect is perfectly inelastic with respect to nominal interest rates (assuming the central bank chooses to control the money supply rather than focusing directly on the interest rate). Thus the money supply function is represented as a vertical line – money supply is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation formula_4, where the supply of money is represented as the real amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the price level, and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate i and the level Y of real income. The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rates and levels of real income for which money supply equals money demand—that is, for which the money market is in equilibrium.\n\nFor a given level of income, the intersection point between the liquidity preference and money supply functions implies a single point on the LM curve: specifically, the point giving the level of the interest rate which equilibrate the money market at the given level of income. Recalling that for the LM curve, the interest rate is plotted against real GDP (whereas the liquidity preference and money supply functions plot interest rates against the quantity of cash balances), an increase in GDP shifts the liquidity preference function rightward and hence increases the interest rate. Thus the LM function is positively sloped.\n\nOne hypothesis is that a government's deficit spending (\"fiscal policy\") has an effect similar to that of a lower saving rate or increased private fixed investment, increasing the amount of demand for goods at each individual interest rate. An increased deficit by the national government shifts the IS curve to the right. This raises the equilibrium interest rate (from i to i) and national income (from Y to Y), as shown in the graph above. The equilibrium level of national income in the IS-LM diagram is referred to as aggregate demand.\n\nKeynesians argue spending may actually \"crowd in\" (encourage) private fixed investment via the accelerator effect, which helps long-term growth. Further, if government deficits are spent on productive public investment (e.g., infrastructure or public health) that spending directly and eventually raises potential output, although not necessarily more (or less) than the lost private investment might have. The extent of any crowding out depends on the shape of the LM curve. A shift in the IS curve along a relatively flat LM curve can increase output substantially with little change in the interest rate. On the other hand, an rightward shift in the IS curve along a vertical LM curve will lead to higher interest rates, but no change in output (this case represents the \"treasury view\").\n\nRightward shifts of the IS curve also result from exogenous increases in investment spending (i.e., for reasons other than interest rates or income), in consumer spending, and in export spending by people outside the economy being modelled, as well as by exogenous decreases in spending on imports. Thus these too raise both equilibrium income and the equilibrium interest rate. Of course, changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the IS curve in the opposite direction.\n\nThe IS–LM model also allows for the role of monetary policy. If the money supply is increased, that shifts the LM curve downward or to the right, lowering interest rates and raising equilibrium national income. Further, exogenous decreases in liquidity preference, perhaps due to improved transactions technologies, lead to downward shifts of the LM curve and thus increases in income and decreases in interest rates. Changes in these variables in the opposite direction shift the LM curve in the opposite direction.\n\nBy itself, the IS–LM model is used to study the short run when prices are fixed or sticky and no inflation is taken into consideration. But in practice the main role of the model is as a sub-model of larger models (especially the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply model – the AD–AS model) which allow for a flexible price level. In the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model, each point on the aggregate demand curve is an outcome of the IS–LM model for aggregate demand Y based on a particular price level. Starting from one point on the aggregate demand curve, at a particular price level and a quantity of aggregate demand implied by the IS–LM model for that price level, if one considers a higher potential price level, in the IS–LM model the real money supply M/P will be lower and hence the LM curve will be shifted higher, leading to lower aggregate demand; hence at the higher price level the level of aggregate demand is lower, so the aggregate demand curve is negatively sloped.\n\n\n"}

Kabat-Zinn was a student of Zen Buddhist teachers such as Philip Kapleau, Thich Nhat Hanh and Seung Sahn and a founding member of Cambridge Zen Center. His practice of yoga and studies with Buddhist teachers led him to integrate their teachings with scientific findings. He teaches mindfulness, which he says can help people cope with stress, anxiety, pain, and illness. The stress reduction program created by Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), is offered by medical centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations.\n\nKabat-Zinn was born in New York City in 1944 as the youngest of nine children to Elvin Kabat, a biomedical scientist, and Sally Kabat, a painter. He graduated from Haverford College in 1964 and went on to earn a Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1971 from MIT, where he studied under Salvador Luria, Nobel Laureate in medicine.\n\nWhile at MIT, Kabat-Zinn was a leading campaigner against military research at the university as well as a campaigner against the Vietnam war. During this time, he pondered his life's purpose, which he called his \"karmic assignment.\"\n\nKabat-Zinn was first introduced to meditation by Philip Kapleau, a Zen missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Buddhist teachers such as Thích Nhất Hạnh and Seungsahn. He also studied at the Insight Meditation Society and eventually taught there. In 1979 he founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where he adapted the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness and developed the Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program. He subsequently renamed the structured eight-week course Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). He removed the Buddhist framework and any connection between mindfulness and Buddhism, instead putting MBSR in a scientific context. He subsequently also founded the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His secular technique, which combines meditation and Hatha yoga, has since spread worldwide. The course aims to help patients cope with stress, pain, and illness by using what is called \"moment-to-moment awareness.\" \n\nKabat-Zinn's MBSR began to get increasing notice with the publication of his first book, \"Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness\" (Delta, 1991), which gave detailed instructions for the practice. Then, in 1993, his work in the Stress Reduction Clinic was featured in Bill Moyers's PBS special \"Healing and the Mind\", spurring wide interest in MBSR and helping to make Kabat-Zinn nationally famous. In 1994 Kabat-Zinn's second book, titled \"Wherever You Go, There You Are\", became a national bestseller. In the latter part of the 1990s, many MBSR clinics were opened, either as standalone centers or as part of a hospital's holistic medicine program.\n\nResearch by Kabat-Zinn includes the effect of MBSR on psoriasis, pain, anxiety, brain function, and immune function.\n\nHe is a board member of the Mind and Life Institute, a group that organizes dialogues between the Dalai Lama and Western scientists. \n\nMBSR has been adapted for use by the US military to improve combatants' \"operational effectiveness,\" apparently with Kabat-Zinn's approval, which has provoked some controversy among mindfulness practitioners.\n\nDiscussing the integration of narratives into mindfulness practice, Kabat-Zinn has said, \"\"the map... can occlude... the territory.\"' \n\nKabat-Zinn is Professor of Medicine Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.\n\nKabat-Zinn is married to Myla Zinn, the daughter of Roslyn and Howard Zinn. They have three grown children.\n\nKabat-Zinn grew up in a non-practicing Jewish family. He has stated that his beliefs growing up were a fusion of science and art. Although he has been \"trained in Buddhism and espouses its principles,\" he rejects the label of \"Buddhist,\" preferring to \"apply mindfulness within a scientific rather than a religious frame.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It may loosely be thought of as a generalization of the gravitational potential of Newtonian gravitation. The metric captures all the geometric and causal structure of spacetime, being used to define notions such as time, distance, volume, curvature, angle, and separating the future and the past.\n\nThroughout this article we work with a metric signature that is mostly positive (); see sign convention. The gravitation constant formula_1 will be kept explicit. The Einstein summation convention, where repeated indices are automatically summed over, is employed.\n\nMathematically, spacetime is represented by a four-dimensional differentiable manifold formula_2 and the metric tensor is given as a covariant, second-degree, symmetric tensor on formula_2, conventionally denoted by formula_4. Moreover, the metric is required to be nondegenerate with signature . A manifold formula_2 equipped with such a metric is a type of Lorentzian manifold.\n\nExplicitly, the metric tensor is a symmetric bilinear form on each tangent space of formula_2 that varies in a smooth (or differentiable) manner from point to point. Given two tangent vectors formula_7 and formula_8 at a point formula_9 in formula_2, the metric can be evaluated on formula_7 and formula_8 to give a real number:\nThis is a generalization of the dot product of ordinary Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space – where the dot product is positive definite – the metric is indefinite and gives each tangent space the structure of Minkowski space.\n\nPhysicists usually work in local coordinates (i.e. coordinates defined on some local patch of formula_2). In local coordinates formula_15 (where formula_16 is an index that runs from 0 to 3) the metric can be written in the form\nThe factors formula_18 are one-form gradients of the scalar coordinate fields formula_15. The metric is thus a linear combination of tensor products of one-form gradients of coordinates. The coefficients formula_20 are a set of 16 real-valued functions (since the tensor formula_4 is a \"tensor field\", which is defined at all points of a spacetime manifold). In order for the metric to be symmetric we must have\ngiving 10 independent coefficients.\n\nIf the local coordinates are specified, or understood from context, the metric can be written as a symmetric matrix with entries formula_20. The nondegeneracy of formula_24 means that this matrix is non-singular (i.e. has non-vanishing determinant), while the Lorentzian signature of formula_4 implies that the matrix has one negative and three positive eigenvalues. Note that physicists often refer to this matrix or the coordinates formula_20 themselves as the metric (see, however, abstract index notation).\n\nWith the quantities formula_18 being regarded as the components of an infinitesimal coordinate displacement four-vector (not to be confused with the one-forms of the same notation above), the metric determines the invariant square of an infinitesimal line element, often referred to as an \"interval\". The interval is often denoted\n\nThe interval formula_29 imparts information about the causal structure of spacetime. When formula_30, the interval is timelike and the square root of the absolute value of formula_29 is an incremental proper time. Only timelike intervals can be physically traversed by a massive object. When formula_32, the interval is lightlike, and can only be traversed by light. When formula_33, the interval is spacelike and the square root of formula_29 acts as an incremental proper length. Spacelike intervals cannot be traversed, since they connect events that are outside each other's light cones. Events can be causally related only if they are within each other's light cones.\n\nThe components of the metric depend on the choice of local coordinate system. Under a change of coordinates formula_35, the metric components transform as\n\nThe simplest example of a Lorentzian manifold is flat spacetime, which can be given as R with coordinates formula_37 and the metric\nNote that these coordinates actually cover all of R. The flat space metric (or Minkowski metric) is often denoted by the symbol \"η\" and is the metric used in special relativity. In the above coordinates, the matrix representation of \"η\" is\n\nIn spherical coordinates formula_43, the flat space metric takes the form\nwhere\nis the standard metric on the 2-sphere.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric describes an uncharged, non-rotating black hole. There are also metrics that describe rotating and charged metrics for black holes.\n\nBesides the flat space metric the most important metric in general relativity is the Schwarzschild metric which can be given in one set of local coordinates by \nwhere, again, formula_47 is the standard metric on the 2-sphere. Here, formula_1 is the gravitation constant and formula_2 is a constant with the dimensions of mass. Its derivation can be found here. The Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric as formula_2 approaches zero (except at the origin where it is undefined). Similarly, when formula_51 goes to infinity, the Schwarzschild metric approaches the Minkowski metric.\n\nWith coordinates\nwe can write the metric as\n\nSeveral other systems of coordinates have been devised for the Schwarzschild metric: Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates, Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates, Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, and Lemaître coordinates.\n\nRotating and charged black holes are described by the Kerr metric, the Kerr–Newman metric, and the Reissner–Nordström metric.\n\nOther notable metrics are:\n\n\nSome of them are without the event horizon or can be without the gravitational singularity.\n\nThe metric \"g\" induces a natural volume form (up to a sign), which can be used to integrate over a region of a manifold. Given local coordinates formula_15 for the manifold, the volume form can be written\nwhere formula_56 is the determinant of the matrix of components of the metric tensor for the given coordinate system.\n\nThe metric formula_4 completely determines the curvature of spacetime. According to the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry, there is a unique connection ∇ on any semi-Riemannian manifold that is compatible with the metric and torsion-free. This connection is called the Levi-Civita connection. The Christoffel symbols of this connection are given in terms of partial derivatives of the metric in local coordinates formula_15 by the formula\n\nThe curvature of spacetime is then given by the Riemann curvature tensor which is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection ∇. In local coordinates this tensor is given by:\n\nThe curvature is then expressible purely in terms of the metric formula_4 and its derivatives.\n\nOne of the core ideas of general relativity is that the metric (and the associated geometry of spacetime) is determined by the matter and energy content of spacetime. Einstein's field equations:\nwhere the Ricci curvature tensor\nand the scalar curvature\nrelate the metric (and the associated curvature tensors) to the stress–energy tensor formula_65. This tensor equation is a complicated set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the metric components. Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are very difficult to find.\n\n\n"}

The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure.\n\nA modeling language can be graphical or textual.\n\n\nAn example of a graphical modeling language and a corresponding textual modeling language is EXPRESS.\n\nNot all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, the use of them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer required. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more challenging problems, such as parallel computing and distributed systems.\n\nA large number of modeling languages appear in the literature.\n\nExample of graphical modeling languages in the field of computer science, project management and systems engineering:\n\nExamples of graphical modeling languages in other fields of science.\n\nInformation models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish. Gellish has natural language variants such as Gellish Formal English and Gellish Formal Dutch (), etc. Gellish Formal English is an information representation language or semantic modeling language that is defined in the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has the form of a Taxonomy-Ontology (similarly for Dutch). Gellish Formal English is not only suitable to express knowledge, requirements and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies, but also information about individual things. All that information is expressed in one language and therefore it can all be integrated, independent of the question whether it is stored in central or distributed or in federated databases. Information models in Gellish Formal English consists of collections of Gellish Formal English expressions, that use natural language terms and formalized phrases. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as:\n\nwhereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows:\n\nSuch Gellish Formal English expressions use names of concepts (such as 'city') and phrases that represent relation types (such as <is located in> and <is classified as a>) that should be selected from the Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy (or of your own domain dictionary). The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models, because the dictionary contains more than 600 standard relation types and contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts. An information model in Gellish can express facts or make statements, queries and answers.\n\nIn the field of computer science recently more specific types of modeling languages have emerged.\n\nAlgebraic Modeling Languages (AML) are high-level programming languages for describing and solving high complexity problems for large scale mathematical computation (i.e. large scale optimization type problems). One particular advantage of AMLs like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, LPL, Mosel, MPL, OPL and OptimJ is the similarity of its syntax to the mathematical notation of optimization problems. This allows for a very concise and readable definition of problems in the domain of optimization, which is supported by certain language elements like sets, indices, algebraic expressions, powerful sparse index and data handling variables, constraints with arbitrary names. The algebraic formulation of a model does not contain any hints how to process it.\n\nBehavioral languages are designed to describe the observable behavior of complex systems consisting of components that\nexecute concurrently. These languages focus on the description of key concepts such as: concurrency, nondeterminism, synchronization, and communication. The semantic foundations of Behavioral languages are process calculus or process algebra.\n\nA discipline-specific modeling (DspM) language is focused on deliverables affiliated with a specific software development life cycle stage. Therefore, such language offers a distinct vocabulary, syntax, and notation for each stage, such as discovery, analysis, design, architecture, contraction, etc. For example, for the analysis phase of a project, the modeler employs specific analysis notation to deliver an analysis proposition diagram. During the design phase, however, logical design notation is used to depict relationship between software entities. In addition, the discipline-specific modeling language best practices does not preclude practitioners from combining the various notations in a single diagram.\n\nDomain-specific modeling (DSM) is a software engineering methodology for designing and developing systems, most often IT systems such as computer software. It involves systematic use of a graphical domain-specific language (DSL) to represent the various facets of a system. DSM languages tend to support higher-level abstractions than General-purpose modeling languages, so they require less effort and fewer low-level details to specify a given system.\n\nA framework-specific modeling language (FSML) is a kind of domain-specific modeling language which is designed for an object-oriented application framework. FSMLs define framework-provided abstractions as FSML concepts and decompose the abstractions into features. The features represent implementation steps or choices.\n\nA FSML concept can be configured by selecting features and providing values for features. Such a concept configuration represents how the concept should be implemented in the code. In other words, concept configuration describes how the framework should be completed in order to create the implementation of the concept.\n\nLinked data and ontology engineering require 'host languages' to represent entities and the relations between them, constraints between the properties of entities and relations, and metadata attributes. JSON-LD and RDF are two major (and semantically almost equivalent) languages in this context, primarily because they support statement reification and contextualisation which are essential properties to support the higher-order logic needed to reason about models. Model transformation is a common example of such reasoning.\n\nObject modeling language are modeling languages based on a standardized set of symbols and ways of arranging them to model (part of) an object oriented software design or system design.\n\nSome organizations use them extensively in combination with a software development methodology to progress from initial specification to an implementation plan and to communicate that plan to an entire team of developers and stakeholders. Because a modeling language is visual and at a higher-level of abstraction than code, using models encourages the generation of a shared vision that may prevent problems of differing interpretation later in development. Often software modeling tools are used to construct these models, which may then be capable of automatic translation to code.\n\nVirtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), before 1995 known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language is a standard file format for representing 3-dimensional (3D) interactive vector graphics, designed particularly with the World Wide Web in mind.\n\n\nVarious kinds of modeling languages are applied in different disciplines, including computer science, information management, business process modeling, software engineering, and systems engineering. Modeling languages can be used to specify:\nModeling languages are intended to be used to precisely specify systems so that stakeholders (e.g., customers, operators, analysts, designers) can better understand the system being modeled.\n\nThe more mature modeling languages are precise, consistent and executable. Informal diagramming techniques applied with drawing tools are expected to produce useful pictorial representations of system requirements, structures and behaviors, but not much else. Executable modeling languages applied with proper tool support, however, are expected to automate system verification and validation, simulation and code generation from the same representations.\n\nA review of modelling languages is essential to be able to assign which languages are appropriate for different modelling settings. In the term settings we include stakeholders, domain and the knowledge connected. Assessing the language quality is a means that aims to achieve better models.\n\nHere language quality is stated in accordance with the SEQUAL framework for quality of models developed by Krogstie, Sindre and Lindland (2003), since this is a framework that connects the language quality to a framework for general model quality. Five areas are used in this framework to describe language quality and these are supposed to express both the conceptual as well as the visual notation of the language. We will not go into a thoroughly explanation of the underlying quality framework of models but concentrate on the areas used to explain the language quality framework.\n\nThe framework states the ability to represent the domain as domain appropriateness. The statement \"appropriateness\" can be a bit vague, but in this particular context it means \"able to express\". You should ideally only be able to express things that are in the domain but be powerful enough to include everything that is in the domain. This requirement might seem a bit strict, but the aim is to get a visually expressed model which includes everything relevant to the domain and excludes everything not appropriate for the domain. To achieve this, the language has to have a good distinction of which notations and syntaxes that are advantageous to present.\n\nTo evaluate the participant appropriateness we try to identify how well the language expresses the knowledge held by the stakeholders. This involves challenges since a stakeholder's knowledge is subjective. The knowledge of the stakeholder is both tacit and explicit. Both types of knowledge are of dynamic character. In this framework only the explicit type of knowledge is taken into account. The language should to a large extent express all the explicit knowledge of the stakeholders relevant to the domain.\n\nLast paragraph stated that knowledge of the stakeholders should be presented in a good way. In addition it is imperative that the language should be able to express all possible explicit knowledge of the stakeholders. No knowledge should be left unexpressed due to lacks in the language.\n\nComprehensibility appropriateness makes sure that the social actors understand the model due to a consistent use of the language. To achieve this the framework includes a set of criteria. The general importance that these express is that the language should be flexible, easy to organize and easy to distinguish different parts of the language internally as well as from other languages. In addition to this, the goal should be as simple as possible and that each symbol in the language has a unique representation.\n\nTo ensure that the domain actually modelled is usable for analyzing and further processing, the language has to ensure that it is possible to reason in an automatic way. To achieve this it has to include formal syntax and semantics. Another advantage by formalizing is the ability to discover errors in an early stage. It is not always that the language best fitted for the technical actors is the same as for the social actors.\n\nThe language used is appropriate for the organizational context, e.g. that the language is standardized within the organization, or that it is supported by tools that are chosen as standard in the organization.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24390", "title": "Paradox", "text": "Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.\n\nSome logical paradoxes are known to be invalid arguments but are still valuable in promoting critical thinking.\n\nSome paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused axioms of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is Russell's paradox, which questions whether a \"list of all lists that do not contain themselves\" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or predicates were flawed. Others, such as Curry's paradox, are not yet resolved.\n\nExamples outside logic include the ship of Theseus from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, M.C. Escher featured perspective-based paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.\n\nIn common usage, the word \"paradox\" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. ironic or unexpected, such as \"the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking\".\n\nCommon themes in paradoxes include self-reference, infinite regress, circular definitions, and confusion between different levels of abstraction.\n\nPatrick Hughes outlines three laws of the paradox:\n\nOther paradoxes involve false statements (\"'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary\", a simple paradox) or half-truths and the resulting biased assumptions. This form is common in howlers.\n\nFor example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road. The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed. The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency surgery. Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, \"I can't operate on this boy. He's my son.\"\n\nThe apparent paradox is caused by a hasty generalization, for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true. The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.\n\nParadoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or language, and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality. Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to logicians and philosophers. \"This sentence is false\" is an example of the well-known liar paradox: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. Russell's paradox, which shows that the notion of \"the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves\" leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.\n\nThought-experiments can also yield interesting paradoxes. The grandfather paradox, for example, would arise if a time-traveler were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the butterfly effect, or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.\n\nOften a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise. In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.\n\nW. V. Quine (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:\n\nA fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.\n\nA taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of Laozi, Zhuangzi, Heraclitus, Bhartrhari, Meister Eckhart, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and G.K. Chesterton, among many others. Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the \"Philosophical Fragments\" that\nBut one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow. But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall. This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.\n\nA paradoxical reaction to a drug is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a sedative or sedated by a stimulant. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a benzodiazepine.\n\n\n"}

Vision-Motor-Perception Program is based on the assumption that vision is the most important sensory mechanism. This program, to help children gain superior perception abilities, was developed based on theory and research in how they develop. \n\nThe basic principles of \"perception training\" are similar to problem solving.\nThe perception of a simple stimulus (like a sound of a given intensity) can normally not be trained to function below its intensity threshold.\n"}
{"id": "34171748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34171748", "title": "Personal identity", "text": "Personal identity\n\nIn philosophy, the matter of personal identity deals with such questions as, \"What makes it true that a person at one time is the same thing as a person at another time?\" or \"What kinds of things are we persons?\" Generally, personal identity is the unique numerical identity of a person in the course of time. That is, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a person at one time and a person at another time can be said to be the person, persisting through time.\n\nIn contemporary metaphysics, the matter of personal identity is referred to as the \"diachronic problem\" of personal identity. The \"synchronic problem\" concerns the question of what features and traits characterize a person at a given time. In continental philosophy and in analytic philosophy, enquiry to the nature of Identity is common. Continental philosophy deals with conceptually maintaining identity when confronted by different philosophic propositions, postulates, and presuppositions about the world and its nature.\n\nOne concept of personal persistence over time is simply to have continuous bodily existence. However, as the Ship of Theseus problem illustrates, even for inanimate objects there are difficulties in determining whether one physical body at one time is the same thing as a physical body at another time. With humans, over time our bodies age and grow, losing and gaining matter, and over sufficient years will not consist of most of the matter they once consisted of. It is thus problematic to ground persistence of personal identity over time in the continuous existence of our bodies. Nevertheless, this approach has its supporters which define humans as a biological organism and asserts the proposition that a psychological relation is not necessary for personal continuity. This personal identity ontology assumes the relational theory of life-sustaining processes instead of bodily continuity.\n\nDerek Parfit's teletransportation problem is designed to bring out intuitions about corporeal continuity. This thought experiment discusses cases in which a person is teleported from Earth to Mars. Ultimately, the inability to specify where on a spectrum does the transmitted person stop being identical to the initial person on Earth appears to show that having a numerically identical physical body is not the criterion for personal identity\n\nIn another concept of mind, the set of cognitive faculties are considered to consist of an immaterial substance, separate from and independent of the body. If a person is then identified with their mind, rather than their body—if a person is considered to their mind—and their mind is such a non-physical substance, then personal identity over time may be grounded in the persistence of this non-physical substance, despite the continuous change in the substance of the body it is associated with. The mind-body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship, if any, that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. One of the aims of philosophers who work in this area is to explain how a non-material mind can influence a material body and vice versa.\n\nHowever, this is not uncontroversial or unproblematic, and adopting it as a solution raises questions. Perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in mental states; ultimately causing sensation. A desire for food, for example, will tend to cause a person to move their body in a manner and in a direction to obtain food. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of an organ (the human brain) possessing electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause neurons of the brain to fire and muscles to contract in the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of René Descartes.\n\nJohn Locke considered personal identity (or the self) to be founded on consciousness (viz. memory), and not on the substance of either the soul or the body. Book II Chapter XXVII entitled \"On Identity and Diversity\" in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1689) has been said to be one of the first modern conceptualizations of consciousness as the repeated self-identification of oneself. Through this identification, moral responsibility could be attributed to the subject and punishment and guilt could be justified, as critics such as Nietzsche would point out.\n\nAccording to Locke, personal identity (the self) \"depends on consciousness, not on substance\" nor on the soul. We are the same person to the extent that we are conscious of the past and future thoughts and actions in the same way as we are conscious of present thoughts and actions. If consciousness is this \"thought\" which \"goes along with the substance [...] which makes the same person\", then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: \"This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but [...] in the identity of consciousness\". For example, one may claim to be a reincarnation of Plato, therefore having the same soul substance. However, one would be the same person as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.\n\nNeither is self-identity founded on the body substance, argues Locke, as the body may change while the person remains the same. Even the identity of animals is not founded on their body: \"animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance\", as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life. On the other hand, identity of humans is based on their consciousness.\n\nBut this interesting border-case leads to this problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging—and punishing—the same person, or simply the same body. In other words, Locke argues that may be judged only for the acts of the body, as this is what is apparent to all but God; however, are in truth only responsible for the acts for which are conscious. This forms the basis of the insanity defense: one cannot be held accountable for acts from which one was unconscious—and therefore leads to interesting philosophical questions:\n\nOr again:\n\nHenceforth, Locke's conception of personal identity founds it not on the substance or the body, but in the \"same continued consciousness\", which is also distinct from the soul since the soul may have no consciousness of itself (as in reincarnation). He creates a third term between the soul and the body—and Locke's thought may certainly be meditated by those who, following a scientist ideology, would identify too quickly the brain to consciousness. For the brain, as the body and as any substance, may change, while consciousness remains the same. Therefore, personal identity is not in the brain, but in consciousness.\n\nHowever, Locke's theory of self reveals debt to theology and to apocalyptic \"great day\", which by advance excuse any failings of human justice and therefore . The problem of personal identity is at the center of discussions about life after death and, to a lesser extent, immortality. In order to exist after death, there has to be a person after death who is the same person as the person who died.\n\nBernard Williams presents a thought experiment appealing to the intuitions about what it is to be the same person in the future. The thought experiment consists of two approaches to the same experiment.\n\nFor the \"first approach\" Williams suggests that suppose that there is some process by which subjecting two persons to it can result in the two persons have \"exchanged\" bodies. The process has put into the body of person B the memories, behavioral dispositions, and psychological characteristics of the person who prior to undergoing the process belonged to person A; and conversely with person B. To show this one is to suppose that before undergoing the process person A and B are asked to which resulting person, A-Body-Person or B-Body-Person, they wish to receive a punishment and which a reward. Upon undergoing the process and receiving either the punishment or reward, it appears to that A-Body-Person expresses the memories of choosing who gets which treatment as if that person was person B; conversely with B-Body-Person.\n\nThis sort of approach to the thought experiment appears to show that since the person who expresses the psychological characteristics of person A to be person A, then intuition is that \"psychological continuity\" is the criterion for personal identity.\n\nThe \"second approach\" is to suppose that someone is told that one will have memories erased and then one will be tortured. Does one need to be afraid of being tortured? The intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured, since it will still be one despite not having one's memories. Next, Williams asked one to consider several similar scenarios.\nIntuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured, that it is still one's self despite having one's memories erased and receiving new memories. However, the last scenario is an identical scenario to the one in the first scenario.\n\nIn the first approach, intuition is to show that one's \"psychological continuity\" is the criterion for personal identity, but in second approach, intuition is that it is one's \"bodily continuity\" that is the criterion for personal identity. To resolve this conflict Williams feels one's intuition in the second approach is stronger and if he was given the choice of distributing a punishment and a reward he would want his body-person to receive the reward and the other body-person to receive the punishment, even if that other body-person has his memories.\n\nIn psychology, personal continuity, also called \"personal persistence\" or \"self-continuity\", is the uninterrupted connection concerning a particular person of his or her private life and personality. Personal continuity is the union affecting the facets arising from personality in order to avoid discontinuities from one moment of time to another time. Personal continuity is an important part of identity; this is the process of ensuring that the qualities of the mind, such as self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment, are consistent from one moment to the next. Personal continuity is the property of a continuous and connected period of time and is intimately related to do with a person's body or physical being in a single four-dimensional continuum. Associationism, a theory of how ideas combine in the mind, allows events or views to be associated with each other in the mind, thus leading to a form of learning. Associations can result from contiguity, similarity, or contrast. Through contiguity, one associates ideas or events that usually happen to occur at the same time. Some of these events form an autobiographical memory in which each is a personal representation of the general or specific events and personal facts.\n\nEgo integrity is the psychological concept of the ego's accumulated assurance of its capacity for order and meaning. Ego identity is the accrued confidence that the inner sameness and continuity prepared in the past are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for others, as evidenced in the promise of a career. Body and ego control organ expressions. and of the other attributes of the dynamics of a physical system to face the emotions of ego death in circumstances which can summon, sometimes anti-theonymistic, self-abandonment.\n\nIt has been argued that from the nature of sensations and ideas there is no such thing as a permanent identity. Daniel Shapiro asserts that one of four major views on identity does not recognize a \"permanent identity\" and instead thinks of \"thoughts without a thinker\" − \"a consciousness shell with drifting emotions and thoughts but no essence\". According to him this view is based on the Buddhist concept of Anatta − \"a continuously evolving flow of awareness\". Malcolm David Eckel states that \"the self changes at every moment and has no permanent identity\" − it is a \"constant process of changing or becoming\", a \"fluid ever-changing self\".\n\nDavid Hume undertook looking at the mind–body problem. Hume also investigated a person's character, the relationship between human and animal nature, and the nature of agency. Hume pointed out that we tend to think that we are the same person we were five years ago. Though we've changed in many respects, the same person appears present as was present then. We might start thinking about which features can be changed without changing the underlying self. Hume, however, denies that there is a distinction between the various features of a person and the mysterious self that supposedly bears those features. When we start introspecting, \"we are never intimately conscious of anything but a particular perception; man is a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed one another with an inconceivable rapidity and are in perpetual flux and movement\".\n\nIt is plain that in the course of our thinking, and in the constant revolution of our ideas, our imagination runs easily from one idea to any other that resembles it, and that this quality alone is to the fancy a sufficient bond and association. It is likewise evident that as the senses, in changing their objects, are necessitated to change them regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other, the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.\n\nNote in particular that, in Hume's view, these perceptions do not \"belong to\" anything. Hume, similar to the Buddha, compares the soul to a commonwealth, which retains its identity not by virtue of some enduring core substance, but by being composed of many different, related, and yet constantly changing elements. The question of personal identity then becomes a matter of characterizing the loose cohesion of one's personal experience.\n\nIn short, what matters for Hume is not that 'identity' exists but that the relations of causation, contiguity, and resemblances obtain among the perceptions. Critics of Hume state in order for the various states and processes of the mind to seem unified, there must be something which perceives their unity, the existence of which would be no less mysterious than a personal identity. Hume solves this by considering substance as engendered by the \"togetherness\" of its properties.\n\nThe \"no-self theory\" holds that the self cannot be reduced to a bundle because the concept of a self is incompatible with the idea of a bundle. Propositionally, the idea of a bundle implies the notion of bodily or psychological relations that do not in fact exist. James Giles, a principal exponent of this view, argues that the \"no-self\" or \"eliminativist theory\" and the bundle or reductionist theory agree about the non-existence of a substantive self. The reductionist theory, according to Giles, mistakenly of the self in terms of various accounts about psychological relations. The no-self theory, on the other hand, \"lets the self lie where it has fallen\". This is because the no-self theory rejects all theories of the self, even the bundle theory. On Giles' reading, Hume is actually a no-self theorist and it is a mistake to attribute to him a reductionist view like the bundle theory. Hume's assertion that personal identity is a fiction supports this reading, according to Giles.\n\nThe Buddhist view of personal identity is also a no-self theory rather than a reductionist theory, because the Buddha rejects attempts to reconstructions in terms of consciousness, feelings, or the body in notions of an eternal/permanent, unchanging Self since our thoughts, personalities and bodies are never the same from moment to moment.\n\nAccording to this line of criticism, the sense of self is an evolutionary artifact, which saves time in the circumstances it evolved for. But sense of self breaks down when considering some events such as memory loss, split personality disorder, brain damage, brainwashing, and various thought experiments. When presented with imperfections in the intuitive sense of self and the consequences to this concept which rely on the strict concept of self, a tendency to mend the concept occurs, possibly because of cognitive dissonance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This privacy protection is only within the browser application as it may leave traces on the hard drive and memory of the device, or via websites by associating the IP address at the web server.\n\nThe earliest reference to private browsing was in May 2005, and was used to discuss the privacy features in the Safari browser bundled with Mac OS X Tiger. The feature has since been adopted in other browsers, and led to popularization of the term in 2008 by mainstream news outlets and computing websites when discussing beta versions of Internet Explorer 8. However, privacy modes operate as shields because browsers typically do not remove all data from the cache after the session. Plug-ins, like Silverlight, are able to set cookies that will not be removed after the session.\n\nThe common web browser plugin Adobe Flash Player began supporting privacy mode in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari with the release of version 10.1 in June 2010..\nSome browsers (like Internet Explorer 8) allow users to select the privacy mode for single tabs, whereas others create a more isolated environment protected by password and cryptography.\n\nPrivate browsing has multiple uses, including:\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation performed a study about the user behavior when the feature is switched on and how long the session lasts.

{"id": "22307545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22307545", "title": "Reverse computation", "text": "Reverse computation\n\nReverse computation is a software application of the concept of reversible computing.\n\nBecause it offers a possible solution to the heat problem faced by chip manufacturers, reversible computing has been extensively studied in the area of computer architecture. The promise of reversible computing is that the amount of heat loss for reversible architectures would be minimal for significantly large numbers of transistors. Rather than creating entropy (and thus heat) through destructive operations, a reversible architecture conserves the energy by performing other operations that preserve the system state.\n\nThe concept of reverse computation is somewhat simpler than reversible computing in that reverse computation is only required to restore the \"equivalent\" state of a software application, rather than support the reversibility of the set of all possible instructions. Reversible computing concepts have been successfully applied as \"reverse computation\" in software application areas such as database design, checkpointing and debugging, and code differentiation.\n\nBased on the successful application of Reverse Computation concepts in other software domains, Chris Carothers, Kalyan Perumalla and Richard Fujimoto suggest the application of reverse computation to reduce state saving overheads\nin \"parallel discrete event simulation\" (PDES). They define an approach based on reverse event codes (which can be automatically generated), and\ndemonstrate performance advantages of this approach over\ntraditional state saving for fine-grained applications (those\nwith a small amount of computation per event).\nThe key property that reverse computation\nexploits is that a majority of the operations that modify the\nstate variables are “constructive” in nature. That is, the undo\noperation for such operations requires no history. Only the\nmost current values of the variables are required to undo the\noperation. For example, operators such as ++, ––, +=, -=, *=\nand /= belong to this category. Note, that the *= and /= operators\nrequire special treatment in the case of multiply or divide\nby zero, and overflow / underflow conditions. More complex\noperations such as circular shift (swap being a special case),\nand certain classes of random number generation also belong\nhere.\n\nOperations of the form a = b, modulo and bit-wise computations\nthat result in the loss of data, are termed to be destructive.\nTypically these operations can only be restored using\nconventional state-saving techniques. However, we observe\nthat many of these destructive operations are a consequence\nof the arrival of data contained within the event being\nprocessed. For example, in the work of Yaun, Carothers, et al., with large-scale TCP simulation, the last-sent time records\nthe time stamp of the last packet forwarded on a router logical process.\nThe swap operation makes this operation reversible.\n\nIn 1985 Jefferson introduced the optimistic synchronization protocol, which was utilized in parallel discrete event simulations, known as Time Warp. To date, the technique known as \"Reverse Computation\" has only been applied in software for optimistically synchronized, parallel discrete event simulation.\n\nIn December 1999, Michael Frank graduated from the University of Florida. His doctoral thesis focused on reverse computation at the hardware level, but included descriptions of both an instruction set architecture and a high level programming language (R) for a processor based on reverse computation.\nIn 1998 Carothers and Perumalla published a paper for the Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation workshop as part of their graduate studies under Richard Fujimoto, introducing technique of Reverse Computation as an alternative rollback mechanism in optimistically synchronized parallel discrete event simulations (Time Warp). In 1998, Carothers became an associate professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Working with graduate students David Bauer and Shawn Pearce, Carothers integrated the Georgia Tech Time Warp design into Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS), which supported only reverse computation as the rollback mechanism. Carothers also constructed RC models for BitTorrent at General Electric, as well as numerous network protocols with students (BGP4, TCP Tahoe, Multicast). Carothers created a course on Parallel and Distributed Simulation in which students were required to construct RC models in ROSS.\n\nAround the same time, Perumalla graduated from Georgia Tech and went to work at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). There he built the uSik simulator, which was a combined optimistic / conservative protocol PDES. The system was capable of dynamically determining the best protocol for LPs and remapping them during execution in response to model dynamics. In 2007 Perumalla tested uSik on Blue Gene/L and found that, while scalability is limited to 8K processors for pure Time Warp implementation, the conservative implementation scales to 16K available processors. Note that benchmarking was performed using PHOLD with a constrained remote event rate of 10%, where the timestamp of events was determined by an exponential distribution with a mean of 1.0, and an additional lookahead of 1.0 added to each event. This was the first implementation of PDES on Blue Gene using reverse computation.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2005 Bauer performed graduate work at RPI under Carothers, focusing solely on reverse computation. He developed the first PDES system solely based on reverse computation, called Rensselaer’s Optimistic Simulation System (ROSS). for combined shared and distributed memory systems. From 2006 to 2009 Bauer worked under E.H. Page at Mitre Corporation, and in collaboration with Carothers and Pearce pushed the ROSS simulator to the 131,072 processor Blue Gene/P (Intrepid). This implementation was stable for remote event rates of 100% (every event sent over the network). During his time at RPI and MITRE, Bauer developed the network simulation system ROSS.Net that supports semi-automated experiment design for black-box optimization of network protocol models executing in ROSS. A primary goal of the system was to optimize multiple network protocol models for execution in ROSS. For example, creating an LP layering structure to eliminate events being passed between network protocol LPs on the same simulated machine optimizes simulation of TCP/IP network nodes by eliminating zero-offset timestamps between TCP and IP protocols. Bauer also constructed RC agent-based models for social contact networks to study the effects of infectious diseases, in particular pandemic influenza, that scale to hundreds of millions of agents; as well as RC models for Mobile ad-hoc networks implementing functionality of mobility (proximity detection) and highly accurate physical layer electromagnetic wave propagation (Transmission Line Matrix model).\n\nThere has also been a recent push by the PDES community into the realm of continuous simulation. For example, Fujimoto and Perumalla, working with Tang et al. have implemented an RC model of particle-in-cell and demonstrated excellent speedup over continuous simulation for models of light as a particle. Bauer and Page demonstrated excellent speedup for an RC Transmission Line Matrix model (P.B. Johns, 1971), modeling light as a wave at microwave frequencies. Bauer also created an RC variant of SEIR that generates enormous improvement over continuous models in the area of infectious disease spread. In addition, the RC SEIR model is capable of modeling multiple diseases efficiently, whereas the continuous model explodes exponentially with respect to the number of combinations of diseases possible throughout the population.\n\n"}
{"id": "1394108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1394108", "title": "Root race", "text": "Root race\n\nRoot races are stages in human evolution in the esoteric cosmology of theosophist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, as described in her book \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888). These races existed mainly on now-lost continents. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably William Scott-Elliot in \"The Story of Atlantis\" (1896) and \"The Lost Lemuria\" (1904). Annie Besant further developed the model in (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from Charles Webster Leadbeater obtained by \"astral clairvoyance\". Further elaboration was provided by Rudolf Steiner in \"Atlantis and Lemuria\" (1904). Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races, Epochs (Steiner felt that the term \"race\" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).\n\nAccording to historian James Webb, the occult concept of succeeding prehistoric races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author Antoine Fabre d'Olivet in his \"Histoire philosophique du genre humain\" (1824). By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book Oera Linda, which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876. Also prior to Blavatsky, the root races were described by the English theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (1883).\n\nSome post-theosophical writers, attempting to reconcile current geological science with some earlier theosophical teachings, have equated Lemuria with the former supercontinent of Gondwana, but this is not theosophy. Early theosophical teachings agree with the original statements of Eduard Suess, who argued that Gondwanaland consisted of parts of the present continents in their present positions, but joined to one another by other lands that have since been submerged. This is also the position of Master Samael Aun Weor.\n\nAtlantis, in the Theosophical cosmology, was a continent that covered a significant part of what is now the Atlantic Ocean. The large continent of Atlantis is said to have \"first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas and islands\". When the main part of Atlantis began to sink, Atlantean settlers migrated to the new lands which were rising to the east, west, and south. These new lands became the Americas, Africa, parts of Asia, and the present European countries, stretching from the Ural Mountains of Russia, westward to include the islands of Ireland and Britain, and even farther westward than that in former times. Some emigrants from the remaining islands in the Atlantic settled on new islands to the east which later consolidated into what is now the district of the Abyssinian highlands and lands somewhat to the north. Atlantis perished through flooding and submergence in 9,564 BC, and its destruction is explained by claiming successive disturbances in the axial rotation of Earth which caused earthquakes, which led to the sudden sinking of Atlantis.\n\nAccording to Blavatsky's writings, there will be seven root races assembled for our Earth; each root race is divided into seven subraces. Only five root races have appeared so far; the sixth is expected to emerge in the 28th century. Francis Bacon (whom theosophy considers to be the legendary Count of St. Germain) in his work \"The New Atlantis\" (1627) describes a potential future civilisation which lives on a land called Bensalem.\n\nThe first root race was \"ethereal\", i.e. they were composed of etheric matter. They reproduced by dividing like an amoeba. Earth was still cooling at that time. The first mountain to arise out of the stormy primeval ocean was Mount Meru.\n\nThe second root race lived in Hyperborea. The second root race was colored golden yellow. Hyperborea included what is now Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Northern Asia and Kamchatka. The climate was tropical because Earth had not yet developed an axial tilt. The esoteric name of their continent is \"Plaksha\"; they called themselves the \"Kimpurshas\". They reproduced by budding.\n\nThe third root race, the Lemurian lived in Lemuria. The esoteric name of Lemuria is \"Shalmali\". Lemuria, according to Theosophists, existed in a large part of what is now the Indian Ocean including Australia and extending into the South Pacific Ocean; its last remnants are the Australian continent, the island of New Guinea, and the island of Madagascar. Lemuria sank gradually and was eventually destroyed by incessantly erupting volcanoes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was thought by geologists that the age of the earth was only about 200 million years (because radioactive dating had not yet come into use), so the geological epochs were believed to have occurred at a much later time than is thought to be the case today. According to traditional Theosophy, the Lemurian root race began 34½ million years ago, in the middle of what was then believed to be the Jurassic; thus, the people of Lemuria coexisted with the dinosaurs. The Lemurian race was much taller and bigger than our current race. The first three subraces of the Lemurians reproduced by laying eggs, but the fourth subrace, beginning 16½ million years ago, began to reproduce like modern humans. As Lemuria was slowly submerged due to volcanic eruptions, the Lemurians colonized the areas surrounding Lemuria, i.e. Africa, Southern India and the East Indies. The descendants of the Lemurian root race, according to traditional Theosophy, include the Capoid race, the Congoid race, the Dravidians, and the Australoid race.\n\nThis race inhabited Atlantis.\n\nThe fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the Ashanti. According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace, Chankshusha Manu, which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north. The esoteric name of Atlantis is \"Kusha\". The Atlantean root race had Mongolian features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the red American Indian, brown Malayan, and yellow Mongolian races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were\n\nThe descendants of the Atlanteans according to traditional Theosophy include those of the Mongolian race, the Malayan race, and the American Indian race as well as some people of what in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was called the \"olive-skinned\" Mediterranean race.\n\nDuring the long period of time when Atlantis was ruled by the Toltecs (the ancestors of the Amerindians), the civilization of Atlantis was at its height. This was the period between about 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, called the \"Golden Age of Atlantis\". The Atlanteans had many luxuries and conveniences. Their capital city was called \"The City of the Golden Gates\". At its height, it had two million inhabitants. There were extensive aqueducts leading to the city from a mountain lake. The Atlanteans had airships powered by the vril that could seat two to eight people. The economic system was socialist like that of the Incas. Atlanteans were the first to develop organized warfare. The military deployed vril-powered air battleships that contained 50 to 100 fighting men. These air battleships deployed poison gas bombs. The infantry fired fire-tipped arrows. The Toltecs on Atlantis worshipped the Sun in temples as grand as those of ancient Egypt that were decorated in bright colors. The sacred word used in meditation was Tau (this was the equivalent of the Aryan sacred word Om). As noted above, the Toltecs colonized all of North America and South America and thus became the people we know as the Amerindians. The downfall of Atlantis started when some of the Toltecs began to practice black magic about 850,000 BC, corrupted by the dragon \"Thevetat\", remembered as Devadatta, the opponent of Buddha. The people began to become selfish and materialistic. Soon thereafter, the Turanians (the ancestors of the people we now know as the Turkic peoples) became dominant in much of Atlantis. The Turanians continued the practice of black magic which reached its height about 250,000 BC and continued until the final sinking of Atlantis, although they were opposed by white magicians. The Master Morya incarnated as the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC to oppose the black magicians. The black magicians used magical spells to breed human-animal chimeras to use as sex slaves. They also had an army composed of chimeras that were composites composed of a human body with the heads of fierce predators such as lions, tigers and bears, that ate enemy corpses on the battlefield. The war between the white magicians and the black magicians continued until the end of Atlantis. The Masters of the Ancient Wisdom telepathically warned their disciples (the white magicians) to flee Atlantis in ships while there was still time to get out before the final cataclysm. As noted above, the final sudden submergence of Atlantis due to earthquakes occurred in 9,564 BC .\n\nBlavatsky asserted humanity was in the fifth root race, the Aryan race, which Theosophists believe to have emerged from the previous fourth root race (Atlantean root race) beginning about 100,000 years ago in Atlantis. (According to Powell, when Madame Blavatsky stated the Aryan root race was 1,000,000 years old, she meant that the souls of the people that later physically incarnated as the first Aryans about 100,000 years ago began to incarnate in the bodies of Atlanteans 1,000,000 years ago. However, another way of interpreting this is that Nature began to create the Aryan race before the final cataclysms.) Theosophists believe the Aryan root race was physically progenerated by the Vaivasvatu Manu, one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. The present-day ethnic group most closely related to the new race is the Kabyle. The small band of only 9,000 people constituting the then small Aryan root race migrated out of Atlantis in 79,797 BC. The bards of the new white root-race poetically referred to the new race as being \"moon-colored\". A small group of these Aryan migrants from Atlantis split from the main body of migrants and went south to the shore of an inland sea in what was then a verdant and lush Sahara where they founded the \"City of the Sun\". The main body of migrants continued onwards to an island called the \"white island\" in the middle of what was then an inland sea in what is now the Gobi desert, where they established the \"City of the Bridge\". (The \"City of the Bridge\" was constructed directly below the etheric city called Shamballa where Theosophists believe the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara, dwells; thus, the ongoing evolution of the Aryan root race has been divinely guided by the being Theosophists call \"The Lord of the World\".)\n\nThe esoteric name of the whole of the present land surface of Earth, i.e. the World Island, the Americas, the Australian continent and Antarctica taken as a whole is \"Krauncha\".\n\nGenerally speaking, a large percentage of the people who live in the time of the period of the fifth root race are part of the fifth root race. However Blavatsky also opines that some Semitic peoples have become \"degenerate in spirituality\". She asserted that some peoples descended from the Lemurians are \"semi-animal creatures\". These latter include \"the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China.\" There are also \"considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc.\" All these aforementioned groups mentioned by Blavatsky except the purported \"wild men of Borneo\" (not to be confused with the famous circus duo, the Wild Men of Borneo) are part of what was in the late 19th and most of the 20th century was called the Australoid race (except for the Bushmen, part of the Capoid race), both of which races, as noted above, were believed by traditional Theosophists to have been descended from the Lemurians.\n\nBlavatsky described the fifth root race with the following words: \"\"The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock – the Fifth Root-Race – and spring from one single progenitor\", which Hindus call Manu. Theosophists believe that each root race has a separate and distinct progenitor.\n\nThe subraces of the Aryan Fifth Root Race include the first subrace, the Hindu, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" on the white island in the middle of the Gobi inland sea to India in 60,000 BC; the second subrace, the Arabian, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Arabia in 40,000 BC; the third subrace, the Persian, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Persia in 30,000 BC; the fourth subrace, the Celts, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Western Europe beginning in 20,000 BC (the Mycenaean Greeks are regarded as an offshoot of the Celtic subrace that colonized Southeast Europe); and the fifth subrace, the Teutonic, which also migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to what is now Germany beginning in 20,000 BC (the Slavs are regarded as an offshoot of the Teutonic subrace that colonized Russia and surrounding areas).\n\nAccording to Blavatsky the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will begin to evolve in the area of the United States in the early 21st century. This sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will be called the \"Australo-American subrace\" and is believed by Theosophists to be now arising from the Teutonic subrace of the Aryan root race in Australia and in the Western United States (many individuals of the new subrace will be born in California) and its surrounding nearby areas (i.e., the Australo-American subrace is in arising from the Anglo-American, Anglo-Canadian, Anglo-Australian and presumably also the Anglo-New Zealander ethnic groups). The sixth or Australo-American sub-race will \"possess certain psychic powers, and for this the pituitary body will be developed, thus giving an additional sense, that of cognising astral emotions in the ordinary waking consciousness. We may say that in general the sixth sub-race will bring in wisdom and intuition, blending all that is best in the intelligence of the fifth subrace and the emotion of the fourth.\"\n\nAccording to C. W. Leadbeater, a colony will be established in Baja California by the Theosophical Society under the guidance of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in the 28th century for the intensive selective eugenic breeding of the sixth root race. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\"progenitor\") of this new root race. By that time, the world will be powered by nuclear power and there will be a single world government led by a person who will be the reincarnation of Julius Caesar. Tens of thousands of years in the future, a new continent will arise in the Pacific Ocean that will be the future home of the sixth root race. California west of the San Andreas Fault will break off from the mainland of North America and become the Island of California off the eastern coast of the new continent.\n\nVictor Skumin proposed a definition and classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight subraces (subspecies): HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.\n\nThe seventh root race will arise from the seventh subrace of the sixth root race on the future continent that the sixth root race will be living on that will arise from the Pacific Ocean. The continent they will inhabit is esoterically called \"Pushkara\".\n\nIt is believed by some Neo-Theosophists that after the present round of human spiritual evolution by reincarnation of souls in root races is completed several dozen million years from now, the human race will migrate to the planet Mercury to continue its spiritual and physical evolution.\n\nModern writers within theosophy or influenced by theosophy defend Blavatsky's use of the terms Aryan race and root race as \"not connected to demagogic ideas\". They say that the classification of humanity into races is still practiced today and that Blavatsky and subsequent esoteric philosophers who expressed similar lines of thought intended a Universal Brotherhood of humanity. Yet root race philosophy is not void of directly biologically racial elements.\n\nBlavatsky promulgated her ideology in a layered, multidimensional style and way, and paradoxical truth was key to her metaphysics. Seemingly paradoxical statements underpin root race theoretic philosophy existing beyond bifurcations of \"liberal\" or \"illiberal\" notions. Blavatsky wrote that, while \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\"—nevertheless, in \"The Secret Doctrine\", Blavatsky posits: \"Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence.\" The interrelationship between spirituality and root race developmental history is nonlinear and complex. Thus: \"Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (The Chinese, Africans, etc..) gradually brought the worship back.\" \n\nThe first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is \"To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour\", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\".\n\nCranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind. \n\n"}

Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as wings and lenses), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several developmental and evolutionary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by natural selection, addressing the question \"Why can't life evolve wheels?\" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as walking, running, or slithering) in natural environments, addressing the question \"If wheels \"could\" evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?\" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.\n\nThere exist two distinct modes of locomotion using rotation: first, simple rolling; and second, the use of wheels or propellers, which spin on an axle or shaft, relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, single-celled organisms.\n\nSome organisms use rolling as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.\n\nSeveral species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including certain caterpillars (which do so to escape danger), tiger beetle larvae, myriapods, mantis shrimp, Armadillidiidae, and Mount Lyell salamanders. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in pangolins, wheel spiders, hedgehogs, armadillos, Armadillo girdled lizards, isopods, and fossilized trilobites. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.\n\nTumbleweeds, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to distribute their seeds. These plants are found especially in open plain environments. The most well-known of these include \"Kali tragus\" (also known as \"Salsola tragus\"), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a noxious weed. Fungi of the genus \"Bovista\" are known to use the same strategy to disperse their spores.\n\nRotifers are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the Latin name \"rotifer\" means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating cilia used for feeding and propulsion.\n\nKeratinocytes, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of wound healing. These cells serve to form a barrier against pathogens and moisture loss through wounded tissue.\n\nDung beetles form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in ancient Egyptian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.\n\nAmong animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style \"in vivo\" vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.\n\nThere are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.\nThe only known example of a biological \"wheel\"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive torque about a fixed body—is the flagellum, a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled prokaryotes for propulsion. The bacterial flagellum is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.\n\nAt the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus \"Vibrio\", there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60 cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. \"Spirillum\" bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.\n\nArchaea, a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as archaella – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaella appear to have evolved from type IV pili.\n\nSome eukaryotic cells, such as the protist \"Euglena\", also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.\n\nThe absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the processes by which multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.\n\nThe processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.\n\nAccording to neo-Darwinism, adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the fitness of individuals. Although neutral changes (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through genetic drift, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. Richard Dawkins describes the matter: \"The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable.\" In such a fitness landscape, wheels might sit on a highly favorable \"peak\", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that \"wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy\".\n\nNatural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called \"exaptation\".\n\nMolecular biologist Robin Holliday has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against creationist or intelligent design accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.\n\nUsing human manufacturing processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of embryonic development are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.\n\nThe greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the interface between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly axle) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism. Unlike animal joints, which have a limited range of motion, a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \"unwound\". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism). There are several functional problems created by this requirement.\n\nIn the case of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in the case of a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.\n\nReducing friction is vital for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.\n\nAnother potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.\n\nWheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the \"missed opportunity\" of biology that it first seems. In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not \"Why does nature not produce wheels?\", but rather, \"Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?\" The use of wheels rather than limbs in most engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.\n\nAlthough stiff wheels are more energy efficient than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.\n\nRolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During the time of the Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book \"Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes\", Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.\n\nWhen moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered \"Gossamer Condor\"), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing.\n\nWheels are prone to slipping—an inability to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.\n\nWork by engineer Mieczysław G. Bekker implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is log-normal; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.\n\nAnatomist Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and wheelchair-using humans. As Jared Diamond points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by dung beetles and tumbleweeds.\n\nWheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.\n\nIn addition, without articulation, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.\n\nWith unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.\n\nLimbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as grasping, manipulating, climbing, branch-swinging, swimming, digging, jumping, throwing, kicking, and grooming. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.\n\nLegends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, pre-Columbian Mexico, the United States, and Australia.\n\nThe hoop snake, a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the \"Tsuchinoko\". Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire \"Pseudomonarchia Daemonum\", was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's \"Dictionnaire Infernal\" as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.\n\nThe Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in a 1951 lithograph. Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author Carl Barks, science fiction writers Fredric Brown, George R. R. Martin, and Joan Slonczewski, and in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" video game series, which first appeared in 1991.\n\nToy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in Veracruz, Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.\nSeveral twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel \"Ozma of Oz\" features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels are composed of keratin, which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and writing partners Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic axles, and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8567154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8567154", "title": "Sabrage", "text": "Sabrage\n\nSabrage is a technique for opening a champagne bottle with a saber, used for ceremonial occasions. The wielder slides the saber along the body of the bottle to break the top of the neck away, leaving the neck of the bottle open and ready to pour. The force of the blunt side of the blade hitting the lip breaks the glass to separate the collar from the neck of the bottle. One does not use the sharp side of the blade. The cork and collar remain together after separating from the neck.\n\nThe technique became popular in France when the army of Napoleon visited many of the aristocratic domains. It was just after the French Revolution and the saber was the weapon of choice of Napoleon's light cavalry (the Hussars). Napoleon's spectacular victories across all Europe gave them plenty of reason to celebrate. During these parties the cavalry would open the champagne with their sabers. Napoleon, who was known to have said, \"Champagne! In victory one deserves it; in defeat one needs it\", may have encouraged this.\n\nThere are many stories about this tradition. One of the more spirited tales is that of Madame Clicquot, who had inherited her husband's small champagne house at the age of 27. She used to entertain Napoleon's officers in her vineyard, and as they rode off in the early morning with their complimentary bottle of champagne, they would open it with their saber to impress the rich young widow.\n\nA champagne sword (\"sabre à champagne\") is an instrument specially made for sabrage. Some swords have short blades, around long and resemble large knives, although others have longer blades. The side of the blade used should be blunt—a sharpened edge is unnecessary because in sabrage it is the impact that is important. If using a sword with a sharp blade then the flat blunt back of the blade is used. A champagne bottle can be opened with a spatula using the same method—or the base of a wine glass.\n\nThe bottle neck is held at an angle of approximately 20 degrees and the sword is cast down on it. The experienced \"sommelier\" can open the bottle with little loss of champagne. However, it is advised to allow a small flow in order to wash away any loose shards of glass that may be adhering to the neck. The first glass poured should also be checked for small glass shards.\n\nA champagne bottle holds a considerable amount of pressure. With early designs, bottles tended to explode and the manufacturers kept making them thicker until they could contain the pressure caused by the release of carbon dioxide during the secondary fermentation. The inside pressure of a typical champagne bottle is around . The diameter of the opening is , so there is a force of about trying to push the cork out of the bottle.\n\nAt the opening of the bottle, there is a lip that creates a stress concentration. On the vertical seam of the bottle there is a thin, faintly visible, prepared seam, which creates a second stress concentration. At the intersection of the seam and the lip, both stress concentrations combine and the strength of the glass is reduced by more than fifty percent. The impact of the saber on this weak point creates a crack that rapidly propagates through the glass, fueled by the momentum of the saber and the pressure in the bottle. Once the crack has severed the top from the bottle, the pressure inside the bottle and the transferred momentum from the saber will send the top flying, typically for a distance of .\n\nThe greatest number of champagne bottles sabered in one minute to be officially recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records is 66 and was achieved by Ashrita Furman (USA) at the Sri Chinmoy Centre, Jamaica, Queens, on 2 August 2015. Ashrita used an \"Arabian sabre\" with a 13-inch blade. He beat the previous record of 47 held by Mirko Rainer, who managed this feat on 6 September 2014 in Mendrisio, Switzerland. \n\nThe greatest number of champagne bottles sabered simultaneously was 630. It was officially recognised a world record by an occasion of the Sciabolata del Santero in Santo Stefano Belbo in Italy on June 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "326922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326922", "title": "Sloth (deadly sin)", "text": "Sloth (deadly sin)\n\nSloth is one of the seven capital sins. It is the most difficult sin to define, and to credit as sin, since it refers to a peculiar jumble of notions, dating from antiquity and including mental, spiritual, pathological, and physical states. One definition is: a habitual disinclination to exertion or laziness.\n\nViews concerning the virtue of work to support society and further God's plan suggest that on the contrary, through inactivity, one invites sin. \"For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do.\" (\"Against Idleness and Mischief\" by Isaac Watts).\n\nThe word \"sloth\" is a translation of the Latin term \"acedia\" (Middle English, \"accidie\") and means \"without care\". Spiritually, \"acedia\" first referred to an affliction attending religious persons, especially monks, wherein they became indifferent to their duties and obligations to God. Mentally, \"acedia\", has a number of distinctive components of which the most important is affectlessness, a lack of any feeling about self or other, a mind-state that gives rise to boredom, rancor, apathy, and a passive inert or sluggish mentation. Physically, \"acedia\" is fundamentally with a cessation of motion and an indifference to work; it finds expression in laziness, idleness, and indolence. Two commentators consider the most accurate translation of \"acedia\" to be \"self-pity,\" for it \"conveys both the melancholy of the condition and self-centeredness upon which it is founded.\"\n\nIn his \"Summa Theologica\", Saint Thomas Aquinas defined sloth as \"sorrow about spiritual good\" and as \"sluggishness of the mind which neglects to begin good... [it] is evil in its effect, if it so oppresses man as to draw him away entirely from good deeds.\" According to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", \"acedia or spiritual sloth goes so far as to refuse the joy that comes from God and to be repelled by divine goodness.\"\n\nSloth includes ignoring the seven gifts of grace given by the Holy Ghost (wisdom, understanding, counsel, knowledge, piety, fortitude, and fear of the Lord); such disregard may lead to the slowing of spiritual progress towards eternal life, to the neglect of manifold duties of charity towards the neighbour, and to animosity towards those who love God.\n\nUnlike the other capital sins, in which the sinner commits immoral acts, sloth is a sin of omission of desire and/or performance. It may arise from any of the other capital vices; for example, a son may omit his duty to his father through anger. While the state and habit of sloth is a mortal sin, the habit of the soul tending towards the last mortal state of sloth is not mortal in and of itself except under certain circumstances.\n\nIn the Philokalia, the word \"dejection\" is used instead of \"sloth,\" for the person who falls into dejection will lose interest in life.\n\nIt is also one of the five hindrances in Buddhism.\n\nSloth has also been defined as a failure to do things that one should do, though the understanding of the sin in antiquity was that this laziness or lack of work was simply a symptom of the vice of apathy or indifference, particularly an apathy or boredom with God.\n\nEmotionally and cognitively, the evil of \"acedia\" finds expression in a lack of any feeling for the world, for the people in it, or for the self. \"Acedia\" takes form as an alienation of the sentient self first from the world and then from itself. Although the most profound versions of this condition are found in a withdrawal from all forms of participation in or care for others or oneself, a lesser but more noisome element was also noted by theologians. From \"tristitia\", asserted Gregory the Great, \"there arise malice, rancour, cowardice, [and] despair...\" Geoffrey Chaucer, too, dealt with this attribute of \"acedia\", counting the characteristics of the sin to include despair, somnolence, idleness, tardiness, negligence, indolence, and \"wrawnesse\", the last variously translated as \"anger\" or better as \"peevishness\". For Chaucer, human's sin consists of languishing and holding back, refusing to undertake works of goodness because, he/she tells him/her self, the circumstances surrounding the establishment of good are too grievous and too difficult to suffer. \"Acedia\" in Chaucer's view is thus the enemy of every source and motive for work.\n\nSloth not only subverts the livelihood of the body, taking no care for its day-to-day provisions, but also slows down the mind, halting its attention to matters of great importance. Sloth hinders man in his righteous undertakings and becomes a path to ruin.\n\nAccording to Peter Binsfeld's \"Binsfeld's Classification of Demons\", Belphegor is the chief demon of the sin Sloth.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2741837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2741837", "title": "Statute of the Jewry", "text": "Statute of the Jewry\n\nThe Statute of the Jewry was a statute issued by Edward I of England in 1275. It placed a number of restrictions on Jews of England, most notably outlawing the practice of usury.\n\nSince the time of the Norman conquest, Jews had been filling a small but vital role in the English economy. Usury by Christians was banned by the Catholic Church at the time, but Jews were permitted to act as moneylenders and bankers. That position enabled some Jews to amass tremendous wealth, but also earned them the enmity of the English populace, which added to the increasing antisemitic sentiments of the time, due to widespread indebtedness and financial ruin among the gentile population.\n\nWhen Edward returned from the Crusades in 1274, two years after his accession as King of England, he found that land had become a commodity, and that many of his subjects had become dispossessed and were in danger of destitution. Jews traded land for money, and land was often mortgaged to Jewish moneylenders.\n\nAs special direct subjects of the monarch, Jews could be taxed indiscriminately by the King. Some have described the situation as indirect usury: the monarch permitting and encouraging Jews to practise usury and then taxing the profit. In the years leading up to the Statute, Edward taxed them heavily to help finance his forthcoming military campaigns in Wales, which commenced in 1277. One theory holds that he had exhausted the financial resources of the Jewish community when the Statute was passed in 1275.\n\n\nThe licence to buy land was included so that farming, along with trading, could give Jews an opportunity to earn a living with the abolition of usury. Unfortunately, other provisions along with widespread prejudice made this difficult for many.\n\nAfter fifteen years had passed, it was discovered that Jews widely but secretly continued to practise usury, leading Edward I to issue the Edict of Expulsion in 1290.\n\n"}
{"id": "37869967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37869967", "title": "Steve Sabella", "text": "Steve Sabella\n\nSteve Sabella (), born (May 19, 1975) in Jerusalem, Palestine is a Berlin-based artist who uses photography and photographic installation as his principle modes of expression, and author of the award-winning memoir, \"The Parachute Paradox\", published by Kerber Verlag in 2016.\n\nSabella has shown his work internationally, at institutions and exhibitions such as , Rencontres d'Arles, Houston FotoFest, Arab World Institute, The Bumiller Collection Berlin, and the International Center for Photography Scavi Scaligeri, which hosted his first institutional retrospective in 2014. As a winner of the 2008 Ellen Auerbach prize, his first artist monograph \"Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014\" was published by Hatje Cantz and the Akademie der Künste, Berlin in 2014.\n\nSabella first began studying at the Naggar School of Photography in Jerusalem, receiving a degree in Art Photography in 1997. In 2007, he received a BA in Visual Arts from the State University of New York.\n\nWhile living in Jerusalem, Sabella worked as both an artist and commissioned photographer. Hired by the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF, UNRWA and many other aid organizations, he was one of the few photographers with complete access to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem during the Second Intifada, which had drastically limited the mobility of Palestinians. In 2005, he was listed as one of Pillars Magazine’s most established brands in Palestine. The same year, Sabella and one of his colleagues were taken hostage in Gaza, abducted by the family of a Palestinian security officer kidnapped by the Palestinian National Authority. He was released unharmed, after several hours of holding.\n\nIn 2007, Sabella established the Palestine Photo Bank, an online image archive formed with the mission of promoting and supporting a positive picture of Palestine and its people.\n\nSabella moved from Palestine to London in 2007, and began to focus solely on his art career. He completed an MA in Photographic Studies from the University of Westminster in 2008, and an MA in Art Business from Sotheby's Institute of Art in 2009. In 2010, he moved to Berlin, where he is currently based.\n\nSabella has utilized large-scale photography, photographic collage, and mixed media in his visual practice. Irrespective of the method or medium, he considers his visual works as a form of research into the genealogy of the image. Rather than something that bears an indexical reference to the world, Sabella sees the photographic image as containing and producing its own form of reality. He has suggested that the creation of these alternate realities can be utilized politically, both as a means to foreclose or liberate the collective imagination—specifically in regards to Israel’s occupation of Palestine.\n\nThroughout his artistic practice, Sabella has created works concerned with the construction of visual history, investigating the role of the image in this process. He has often drawn parallels between his artwork and the field of archaeology, both in practice and theory: some of his photo-collages are partly composed by continuously removing layers of photographic visuals; other artworks have been printed on stones and paint fragments, appearing as ancient artifacts. Regarding the \"38 Days of Re-Collection\" series, consisting of photographs printed on fragments of paint scraped from the walls of Jerusalem’s Old City, the scholar Ella Shohat wrote, “Scraping thus becomes both an act of excavation of the buried substrata of forgotten lives, as well as a means to visualise lives once again intermingled.”\n\nCritics of Sabella's work have often noted and discussed the themes of exile and the Palestinian experience. Artworks like \"Settlement - Six Israelis & One Palestinian\" and \"38 Days of Re-Collection\" bear more explicit connotations of Sabella’s birthplace in their content and media, but the themes of diaspora and occupation are also suggested by the titles of his series such as \"In Exile\" and \"Independence\".\n\nIn 2014 Sabella stated, \"All we need is the imagination to find who we are and what we are searching for. It is the responsibility of the individual to stand up and free him or herself from the new form of colonization that people are affected by yet are unaware of, the colonization of the imagination. Palestinians do not need the UN, the EU, the United States or any other country in the world, and especially not Israel, to declare to them that they are free. We are all born free. Every Palestinian should wake up today and say –– I am a free person.\"\n\nIn the artist’s monograph, Hubertus von Amelunxen wrote, ”Steve Sabella is a Palestinian, born in Jerusalem in 1975 … Although he still has the privilege of being able to return, he chose exile, and art teaches him to grasp exile in its distorting and destructive consequences, which leads to an existence that is marked by a driven search and borders on disintegration. His art is an art of understanding; it is poetic and suppresses neither expulsion nor salvation. It keeps to the path and forms a bridge — it is the bridge.”\n\nSince the beginning of his artistic career, Sabella has experimented and played upon the traditions of the photographic medium: his 1997 series \"Search\" was shot on infrared film; \"Kan Yama Kan\" (2005) and \"Settlement - Six Israelis & One Palestinian\" (2008-2010) both reconfigure photographs to be viewed through installation; photographs in his works \"Till the End\" (1997) and \"38 Days of Re-Collection\" (2014) are printed on stones and fragments of paint, respectively. Sabella’s photo-collages such as \"Euphoria\" (2010) and \"Metamorphosis\" (2012) have elicited comparisons to the medium of painting; in this respect, the artist and historian Kamal Boullata has written, “Over the last decade [Sabella] has been using his camera as a painter uses his brush... A few decades ago, that is, long before globalization permeated all fields of cultural expression in our world, I wrote on the evolution of Palestinian painting following the country's national catastrophe in 1948. I documented how painters living at home or as refugees in the proximity of the homeland have universally employed a representational language of expression. The further away they lived, the more they engaged in abstraction. At the time, I never imagined such a phenomenon could possibly manifest itself in the field of photography.”\n\nThe variation in formal rhythm and tone in many of Sabella’s photo-collages, as well as the theme running throughout his work of divergent voices being placed in dialogue, has prompted Hubertus von Amelunxen to relate musical concepts to his oeuvre. In \"Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014\", von Amelunxen draws connections to notions of counterpoint, and writes specifically on Sabella’s work \"Sinopia\", which collages photographs of the skyline of Manama, Bahrain, “The city, photographed at dawn and during the day, is reflected along the central axis, the sea and sky indistinguishable from one another and the skyline, appearing out of the mist of dawn, retracting and then rising up again, reverberates at different pitches. Through visual reiteration, shadowy high-rises, a sound pattern emerges…” \n\nSabella has also collaborated with musicians. In 2014, he commissioned the jazz ensemble The Khoury Project to interpret the visual form of his \"Sinopia\" skyline collage as a waveform, and create an electroacoustic composition that also sampled audio from locations in Bahrain.\n\nFrom 1997 to the late 2000s, Sabella exhibited his work at various venues in Palestine. 2010 saw Sabella’s first solo in Europe, \"Steve Sabella: In Exile\" at Metroquadro Gallery, Rivoli. Since then, notable solo exhibitions include \"Archaeology of the Future\" at the International Centre for Photography Scavi Scaligeri, Verona (2014); \"Fragments\" at Berloni Gallery, London (2014); \"Layers\" at Contemporary Art Platform, Kuwait (2014); \"Independence\" at Meem Gallery, Dubai (2014); and \"Fragments From Our Beautiful Future\" at The Bumiller Collection Berlin.\n\nSabella has shown work in group exhibitions including \"Gates of the Mediterranean\" at the Castello di Rivoli, Rivoli (2008, curated by Martina Corgnati); \"First Biennial of Photographers of the Contemporary Arab World\" at the Arab World Institute (IMA) and the Maison européenne de la photographie, Paris (2015, curated by Gabriel Bauret); \"Nel Mezzo del Mezzo\" at the Palazzo Riso, Palermo (2015, curated by Christine Macel); \"View From Inside\" at the FotoFest Biennial, Houston (2014, curated by Karin Adrian von Roques); and \"Keep Your Eye on the Wall\" at Les Rencontres d’Arles, Arles (2013, curated by MASASAM).\n\nThe first monograph of the artist's work, \"Steve Sabella - Photography 1997-2014\", was published by Hatje Cantz in collaboration with the Akademie der Künste, Berlin, in 2014. Its core texts are written by Hubertus von Amelunxen, with a foreword by Kamal Boullata. Hatje Cantz states that the book, \"reads time and history out of the photographs and thus describes the genesis of Sabella’s photographic oeuvre under the aspects of exile, identity, migration, and the divided topologies of the 21st century.\"\n\nPublished by Maretti Editore for Sabella’s 2014 retrospective of the same name at the International Center for Photography Scavi Scaligeri, Archaeology of the Future contains texts by Sabella, Karin Adrian von Roque, Beatrice Benedetti, and Leda Monsour, among others.\n\nSteve Sabella and Rebecca Raue’s exhibition of the same name, shown at The Bumiller Collection, Berlin, was accompanied by a catalogue published by Kerber Verlag. The book included texts discussing the works of Sabella, Raue, and medieval Persian game pieces and mirrors included in the show from The Bumiller’s Collection’s archive; contributors included Hubertus von Amelunxen, Ella Shohat, T.J. Demos, Elliot R. Wolfson, and A.S. Bruckstein Çoruh.\n\nIn addition to his visual work, Sabella has developed a writing practice that continues to vary in style and format. His essays on the international art market and art-world dynamics first appeared in \"Contemporary Practices Art Journal\", for which he was a regular contributor from 2008 to 2012.\n\nSabella’s memoir \"The Parachute Paradox\" was published in a limited edition of 1,250 by Kerber Verlag in 2016. The book details Sabella's upbringing in Jerusalem under Israeli occupation, his subsequent nomadism, and the development of his art practice as a means of mental emancipation from the colonization of the imagination. The book was granted the best memoir prize of the 2017 Eric Hoffer Award and the 2016 Nautilus Book Awards, and was a finalist for the 2017 International Book Awards.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, Sabella began publishing his new book project, The Artist’s Curse. He has pledged to post online one new passage — or “curse” — every day for one year. The curses are numbered, short-form and modular prose pieces ranging from abstract and inspirational notions about the life of an artist, to detailing real-world practices of the global art market.\n\nFor his visual art practice, Sabella has received a number of accolades, including Young Artist of the Year Award - A. M. Qattan Foundation in Palestine (2002), the Chevening Scholarship for MA in Photographic Studies from University of Westminster (2008), the Caparo Award of Distinction for MA in Photographic Studies from University of Westminster (2008), the Independent Photographers Terry O'Neil Award (2008, shortlisted and exhibited), the Ellen Auerbach Award - Akademie der Künste in Berlin (2008), and the Saïd Foundation Scholarship, which partially sponsored his studies for an MA in Art Business from Sotheby's Institute of Art (2009).\n\nThe Parachute Paradox won the 2017 Eric Hoffer Award and the 2016 Nautilus Book Awards, both for best memoir. The book was also a finalist for The International Book Awards.\n\nSabella has been the subject of a number of documentaries, including \"In The Darkroom with Steve Sabella\" by Nadia Johanne Kabalan (2014). He has also participated in film interviews for Deutsche Welle, France 24, \"Al Jazeera\" and \"Electronic Intifada\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "238346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238346", "title": "Tarring and feathering", "text": "Tarring and feathering\n\nTarring and feathering is a form of public torture and humiliation used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in feudal Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a type of mob vengeance. Awareness of tarring and feathering in popular culture remains.\n\nThe victim would be stripped naked, or stripped to the waist. Hot tar was then either poured or painted onto the person while they were immobilized. Then the victim either had feathers thrown on them or was rolled around on a pile of feathers so that they stuck to the tar.\n\nThe image of the tarred-and-feathered outlaw remains a metaphor for severe public criticism.\n\nThe earliest mention of the punishment appears in orders that Richard I of England issued to his navy on starting for the Holy Land in 1189. \"Concerning the lawes and ordinances appointed by King Richard for his navie the forme thereof was this ... item, a thiefe or felon that hath stolen, being lawfully convicted, shal have his head shorne, and boyling pitch poured upon his head, and feathers or downe strawed upon the same whereby he may be knowen, and so at the first landing-place they shall come to, there to be cast up\" (transcript of original statute in \"Hakluyt's Voyages\", ii. 21).\n\nA later instance of this penalty appears in \"Notes and Queries\" (series 4, vol. v), which quotes James Howell writing in Madrid in 1623 of the \"boisterous Bishop of Halberstadt ... having taken a place where there were two monasteries of nuns and friars, he caused divers feather beds to be ripped, and all the feathers thrown into a great hall, whither the nuns and friars were thrust naked with their bodies oiled and pitched and to tumble among these feathers, which makes them here (Madrid) presage him an ill-death.\" (The Bishop was apparently Christian the Younger of Brunswick.)\n\nIn 1696, a London bailiff attempted to serve process on a debtor who had taken refuge within the precincts of the Savoy. The bailiff was tarred and feathered and taken in a wheelbarrow to the Strand, where he was tied to a maypole that stood by what is now Somerset House as an improvised pillory.\n\nIn 1766, Captain William Smith was tarred, feathered, and dumped into the harbor of Norfolk, Virginia by a mob that included the town's mayor. A vessel picked him out of the water just as his strength was giving out. He survived and was later quoted as saying that they \"dawbed my body and face all over with tar and afterwards threw feathers on me.\" Smith was suspected of informing on smugglers to the British customs agents, as was the case with most other tar-and-feathers victims in the following decade.\n\nThe practice appeared in Salem, Massachusetts in 1767, when mobs attacked low-level employees of the customs service with tar and feathers. In October 1769, a mob in Boston attacked a customs service sailor the same way, and a few similar attacks followed through 1774. The tarring and feathering of customs worker John Malcolm received particular attention in 1774. Such acts associated the punishment with the Patriot side of the American Revolution. An exception occurred in March 1775 when a British regiment inflicted the same treatment on Thomas Ditson, a Billerica, Massachusetts man who attempted to buy a musket from one of the regiment's soldiers. There is no known case of a person dying from being tarred and feathered in this period. During the Whiskey Rebellion, local farmers inflicted the punishment on federal tax agents.\n\nBeginning on September 11, 1791, western Pennsylvania farmers rebelled against the federal government's taxation on western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers during the Whiskey Rebellion. Their first victim was reportedly a recently appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson. He was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. Other officials who attempted to serve court warrants on Johnson's attackers were whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because of these and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution.\n\nJoseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was dragged from his home during the night of March 24, 1832 by a group of men who stripped and beat him before tarring and feathering him. His wife and infant child were knocked from their bed by the attackers and were forced from the home and threatened. (The infant died several days later from exposure.) Smith was left for dead, but limped back to the home of friends. They spent much of the night scraping the tar from his body, leaving his skin raw and bloody. The following day, Smith spoke at a church devotional meeting and was reported to have been covered with raw wounds and still weak from the attack.\n\nIn 1851, a Know-Nothing mob in Ellsworth, Maine tarred and feathered Swiss-born Jesuit priest Father John Bapst in the midst of a local controversy over religious education in grammar schools. Bapst fled Ellsworth to settle in nearby Bangor, Maine, where there was a large Irish-Catholic community, and a local high school there is named for him.\nTarring and feathering was not restricted to men. The November 27, 1906 Ada, Oklahoma \"Evening News\" reports that a vigilance committee consisting of four young married women from East Sandy, Pennsylvania corrected the alleged evil conduct of their neighbor Mrs. Hattie Lowry in whitecap style. One of the women was a sister-in-law of the victim. The women appeared at Mrs. Lowry's home in open day and announced that she had not heeded the spokeswoman and leader. Two women held Mrs. Lowry to the floor while the other two smeared her face with stove polish until it was completely covered. They then poured thick molasses upon her head and emptied the contents of a feather pillow over the molasses. The women then marched the victim to a railroad camp, tied by the wrists, where two hundred workmen stopped work to watch the spectacle. After parading Mrs. Lowry through the camp, the women tied her to a large box where she remained until a man released her. Three of the women involved were arrested, pleaded guilty and each paid a $10.00 fine.\n\nA group of black-robed Knights of Liberty (a faction of the KKK) tarred and feathered seventeen members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in Oklahoma in 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage.\n\nIn the 1920s, vigilantes were opposed to IWW organizers at California's harbor of San Pedro. They kidnapped at least one organizer, subjected him to tarring and feathering, and left him in a remote location.\n\nThe Wednesday, May 28, 1930 edition of the \"Miami Daily News-Record\" contains on its front page the arrests of five brothers (Isaac, Newton, Henry, Gordon and Charles Starns) from Louisiana accused of tarring and feathering Dr. S. L. Newsome, who was a prominent dentist. This was in retaliation for the dentist having an affair with one of the brother's wives.\n\nThere were several examples of tarring and feathering of African-Americans in the lead-up to World War I in Vicksburg, Mississippi. According to William Harris, this was a relatively rare form of mob punishment to Republican African-Americans in the post-bellum U.S. South, as its goal was typically pain and humiliation rather than death.\n\nDuring World War I, anti-German sentiment was widespread and many German-Americans were attacked. For example, in August 1918 a German-American farmer, John Meints of Luverne, Minnesota (pictured above), was captured by a group of men, taken to the nearby South Dakota border and tarred and feathered – for allegedly not supporting war bonds. Meints sued his assailants and lost, but on appeal to a federal court he won, and in 1922 settled out of court for $6,000. In March 1922, a German-born Catholic priest in Slaton, Texas, Joseph M. Keller, who had been harassed by local residents during World War I due to his ethnicity, was accused of breaking the seal of confession and tarred and feathered. Thereafter Keller served a Catholic parish in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nSimilar tactics were also used by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the early years of The Troubles. Many of the victims were women accused of sexual relationships with policemen or British soldiers. \nIn August 2007, loyalist groups in Northern Ireland were linked to the tarring and feathering of an individual accused of drug-dealing.\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

{"id": "797295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797295", "title": "Tulpa", "text": "Tulpa\n\nTulpa is a concept in mysticism and the paranormal of a being or object which is created through spiritual or mental powers. It was adapted by 20th century theosophists from Tibetan sprul-pa () which means \"emanation\" or \"manifestation\". Modern practitioners use the term to refer to a type of willed imaginary friend which practitioners consider to be sentient and relatively autonomous.\n\nOne early Buddhist text, the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\", lists the ability to create a “mind-made body” (\"manomāyakāya\") as one of the \"fruits of the contemplative life\". Commentarial texts such as the \"Patisambhidamagga\" and the \"Visuddhimagga\" state that this mind-made body is how Gautama Buddha and arhats are able to travel into heavenly realms using the continuum of the mindstream (citta-santāna) and it is also used to explain the multiplication miracle of the Buddha as illustrated in the \"Divyavadana\", in which the Buddha multiplied his emanation body (\"nirmita\") into countless other bodies which filled the sky. A Buddha or other realized being is able to project many such \"nirmitas\" simultaneously in an infinite variety of forms in different realms simultaneously.\n\nThe Indian Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) defined \"nirmita\" as a siddhi or psychic power (Pali: \"iddhi\", Skt: \"ṛddhi\") developed through Buddhist discipline, concentrated discipline (\"samadhi\") and wisdom in his seminal work on Buddhist philosophy, the \"Abhidharmakośa\". Asanga's \"Bodhisattvabhūmi\" defines nirmāṇa as a magical illusion and \"basically, something without a material basis\". The Madhyamaka school of philosophy sees all reality as empty of essence; all reality is seen as a form of nirmita or magical illusion.\n\nEmanation bodies—nirmanakaya, sprulsku, sprul-pa and so on—are connected to trikaya, the Buddhist doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha. They are usually emanation bodies of celestial beings, though \"unrealized beings\" such as humans may have their own emanation bodies or even \"be\" emanation bodies. For example, the 14th Dalai Lama is considered by some followers to be an emanation-reincarnation or tulku of Chenrezig, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. The 14th Dalai Lama mentioned in a public statement that his successor might appear via emanation while the current Dalai Lama is still alive.\n\n20th century theosophists adapted the concepts of \"emanation body\"—nirmita, tulku, sprul-pa and others—into the concepts of \"tulpa\" and \"thoughtform\". The term “thoughtform” is used as early as 1927 in Evans-Wentz' translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. John Myrdhin Reynolds in a note to his English translation of the life story of Garab Dorje defines a \"tulpa\" as “an emanation or a manifestation.” \n\nBelgian-French explorer, spiritualist, and Buddhist Alexandra David-Néel claimed to have observed these mystical practices in 20th century Tibet. She reported tulpas are \"magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought.\" David-Néel wrote that \"an accomplished Bodhisattva is capable of effecting ten kinds of magic creations. The power of producing magic formations, tulkus or less lasting and materialized tulpas, does not, however, belong exclusively to such mystic exalted beings. Any human, divine or demoniac being may be possessed of it. The only difference comes from the degree of power, and this depends on the strength of the concentration and the quality of the mind itself.\"\n\nDavid-Néel wrote of the tulpa's ability to develop a mind of its own: \"Once the tulpa is endowed with enough vitality to be capable of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker's control. This, say Tibetan occultists, happens nearly mechanically, just as the child, when his body is completed and able to live apart, leaves its mother's womb.\" David-Néel claimed to have created a tulpa in the image of a jolly Friar Tuck-like monk which later developed a life of its own and had to be destroyed. David-Néel raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: \"I may have created my own hallucination\", though she reports that others could see the thoughtforms that have been created.\n\nThe Western occult understanding of the concept of \"thoughtform\" is believed by some to have originated as an interpretation of the Tibetan concept of \"tulpa\". The concept is related to the Western philosophy and practice of magic. Occultist William Walker Atkinson in his book \"The Human Aura\" described thought-forms as simple ethereal objects emanating from the auras surrounding people, generating from their thoughts and feelings. He further elaborated in \"Clairvoyance and Occult Powers\" how experienced practitioners of the occult can produce thoughtforms from their auras that serve as astral projections which may or may not look like the person who is projecting them, or as illusions that can only be seen by those with \"awakened astral senses\". The theosophist Annie Besant, in her book \"Thought-forms\", divides them into three classes: forms in the shape of the person who creates them, forms that resemble objects or people and may become \"ensouled\" by \"nature spirits\" or by the dead, and forms that represent \"inherent qualities\" from the astral or mental planes, such as emotions.\n\nThe concept of tulpa was popularized and secularized in the Western world through fiction, gaining popularity on television in the late 1990s and 2000s. In 2009, anonymous posters on the discussion board 4chan started experimenting with creating tulpas, and the community gained popularity through the emergence of the . The anthropologist and cognitive scientist Samuel Veissiere wrote that on February 2015 the Reddit forum, which carries most of the tulpamancy conversations in English, had 7740 members, but less than 200 active posters. The fans attempted to use meditation and lucid dreaming techniques to create imaginary friends. Surveys by Veissière explored this community's demographic, social, and psychological profiles. These individuals, calling themselves \"tulpamancers\", treat the tulpas as a \"real or somewhat-real person\". The number of active participants in these online communities is in the low hundreds, and few meetings in person have taken place. They belong to \"primarily urban, middle class, Euro-American adolescent and young adult demographics\" and they \"cite loneliness and social anxiety as an incentive to pick up the practice.\" 93.7% of respondents expressed that their involvement with the creation of tulpas has \"made their condition better\", and led to new unusual sensory experiences. Some practitioners have sexual and romantic interactions with their tulpas, though the practice is controversial and trending towards taboo. One survey found that 8.5% support a metaphysical explanation of tulpas, 76.5% support a neurological or psychological explanation, and 14% \"other\" explanations.\n"}

First introduced in 2013, unicity is measured by the number of points \"p\" needed to uniquely identify an individual in a data set. The fewer points needed, the more unique the traces are and the easier they would be to re-identify using outside information.\n\nIn a high-dimensional, human behavioural data set, such as mobile phone meta-data, for each person, there exists potentially thousands of different records. In the case of mobile phone meta-data, credit card transaction histories and many other types of personal data, this information includes the time and location of an individual. \n\nIn research, unicity is widely used to illustrate the re-identifiability of anonymous data sets. In 2013 researchers from the MIT Media Lab showed that only 4 points needed to uniquely identify 95% of individual trajectories in a de-identified data set of 1.5 million mobility trajectories. These \"points\" were location-time pairs that appeared with the resolution of 1 hour and 0.15km² to 15km². These results were shown to hold true for credit card transaction data as well with 4 points being enough to re-identify 90% of trajectories. Further research shown that the unicity of the apps installed by people on their smartphones, the trajectories of vehicles, mobile phone data from Boston and Singapore, and, public transport data in Singapore obtained from smartcards.\n\nUnicity (formula_1) is formally defined as the expected value of the fraction of uniquely identifiable trajectories, given \"p\" points selected from those trajectories uniformly at random. A full computation of formula_1 of a data set formula_4 requires picking \"p\" points uniformly at random from each trajectory formula_5, and then checking whether or not any other trajectory also contains those \"p\" points. Averaging over all possible sets of \"p\" points for each trajectory results in a value for formula_1. This is usually prohibitively expensive as it requires considering every possible set of \"p\" points for each trajectory in the data set — trajectories that sometimes contain thousands of points.\n\nInstead, unicity is usually estimated using sampling techniques. Specifically, given a data set formula_4, the the estimated unicity is computed by sampling from formula_4 a fraction of the trajectories formula_9 and then checking whether each of the trajectories formula_10 are unique in formula_4 given \"p\" randomly selected points from each formula_12. The fraction of formula_9 that is uniquely identifiable is then the unicity estimate. \n\n"}

Main characters such as Dark Lady of the sonnets have elicited a substantial amount of criticism, which received added impetus during the second-wave feminism of the 1960s. A considerable number of book-length studies and academic articles investigate the topic, and several moons of Uranus are named after women in Shakespeare.\n\nIn Shakespeare's tragedies and his plays in general, there are several types of female characters. They influence other characters, but are also often underestimated. Women in Shakespearean plays have always had important roles, sometimes the leading role. Whether they are there to change the story or stabilize it, they are there for a reason. Some women are stronger than others, and their effect on the play is different for each one. They often surpass the male heroes.\n\nEarly criticism of female characters in Shakespeare's drama focused on the positive attributes the dramatist bestows on them and often claimed that Shakespeare realistically captured the \"essence\" of femininity. Helen Zimmern, in the preface to the English translation of Louis Lewes's study \"The Women of Shakespeare\", argued in 1895 that \"of Shakespeare's \"dramatis personae\", his women are perhaps the most attractive, and also, in a sense, his most original creations, so different are they, as a whole, from the ideals of the feminine type prevalent in the literature of his day.\"\nLewes himself strikes a similar tone of praise in his conclusion: \"The poet's magic wand has laid open the depths of woman's nature, wherein, beside lovely and exquisite emotion, terrible passions play their dangerous and fatal part.\"\n\nThis early period of women in Shakespeare, which ends in the beginning of the twentieth century, is characterised by a very conventional tone and treatment and the confirmation of female submission. The editors of a 1983 collection called \"The Woman's Part\", referencing three books by women authors from the 19th century (an authoritative book, \"Shakespeare's Heroines: Characteristics of Women\" by Anna Jameson, originally published 1832, and two fictional biographies in novel form of two of Shakespeare's heroines from 1885) conclude that these early critics are \"uneasy\" when Shakespeare's heroines behave \"unwomanly\", and that adaptations of their stories \"praise girlish sweetness and modesty in a style that today appears effusive.\" These are, they say, \"culturally induced limitations\" on the part of the female critics and authors studying and adapting Shakespeare's women.\n\nRecent critics take a variety of approaches to the topic. For feminist critics influenced by French feminism, the analysis of the female body in Shakespeare's plays has proven fruitful. Carol Chillington Rutter, author of \"Enter the Body: Women and Representation on Shakespeare's Stage\" (2001), focuses for instance on the body of Cordelia, as her father, King Lear, carries her on to the stage; on the body of Ophelia in the grave; and on the bodies of the two women on the bed at the end of \"Othello\", \"a play that destroys women.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In the passage, the capitalized \"THE\" signifies the viewpoint meaning \"the one and only\" absolute truth.\n\nEmil du Bois-Reymond used the term \"World Riddle\" in 1880 for seven great questions of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the Berlin Academy of Sciences he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.\n\n\n"}
