Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.\n\nOn 13 January 2011, the \"Verkhovna Rada\" (the Parliament of Ukraine) adopted two laws on access to information: The Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information” and the new wording of the Law of Ukraine “On Information” (1992). They entered into force on May 9, 2011.\n\nThe Art. 5 of the Law of Ukraine \"On Information\" provides the «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests.\n\nBoth of the laws were criticized in 2012 by the London-based association advocating for free expression Article 19, which considered that they lack provisions to ensure that the rights to privacy and freedom of expression and information are appropriately balanced.\n\nOn April 9, 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a law to encourage government agencies to release and provide more information from the country’s archive of Soviet-era KGB files. The information would be transferred to the Institute of National Remembrance and be declassified. Moreover, the same law encourages to publish free operational data, statistics and reports on government websites and on the national open data web platform.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the draft law No. 0947. According to experts, it makes a variety of improvements related to access to information. Among other things, fines are added for ungrounded refusals to disclose information, for an untimely or incomplete provision of information, or the provision of false information.\n\nAccording to the Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM) of the Open Government Partnership (OPG) organization published in 2016, Ukraine’s progress for improving access to information, corruption prevention mechanisms, and bringing citizens in government decision making is “truly impressive”- especially considering the difficult political situation. However, according to the IRM, the country fell short in delivering on promises made to improve government accountability and fight corruption. In particular, according to an expert, Ukraine needs to further open public contracting, including in publicly owned enterprises, and to bring more transparency to natural resource extraction. According to IRM, also, in its next OPG National Plan, Ukraine should provide for among its commitments for a system of electronic disclosure so that public officials’ assets are verifiable.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41129520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41129520", "title": "Ambient optic array", "text": "Ambient optic array\n\nThe ambient optic array is the structured arrangement of light with respect to a point of observation. American psychologist James J. Gibson posited the existence of the ambient optic array as a central part of his ecological approach to optics. For Gibson, perception is a bottom-up process, whereby the agent accesses information about the environment directly from invariant structures in the ambient optic array, rather than recovering it by means of complex cognitive processes. More controversially, Gibson claimed that agents can also directly pick-up the various affordances of the environment, or opportunities for the observer to act in the environment, from the ambient optic array.\n\nGibson stressed that the environment is not composed of geometrical solids on a plane, as in a painting, but is instead best understood as objects nested within one another and organized hierarchically by size. The ambient optic array, therefore, is also organized hierarchically by size, though the components are the solid angles from the object to the point of observation. Large solid angles come from the facades of various objects and interspaces between objects in the environment. Smaller solid angles are nested within the larger angles, and detail the facets and finer properties of the object. As the observer explores the environment, her relation to these angles change, and accordingly the appearance of the environment changes. For example, objects appear to grow larger or smaller depending on whether the observer moves towards or away from the object. This is because the angle subtended by the object to the observer becomes bigger as the observer gets closer, and smaller as the observer recedes. However the objective size of the actual object in the environment never changes. Put simply by philosopher Alva Noë, the ambient optic array is \"how things look from here in these conditions.\"\n\nGibson was interested in the structures of the ambient optic array that are invariant, or structures that remain static regardless of the actions of the observer. For example Gibson noted that the upper hemisphere of the array (the sky) tends to be much less structured and brighter than the lower hemisphere (the cluttered earth). No matter what the observer does, the light will always be structured in this way. He also noticed that \"optical flow patterns\", or optical flow invariants, are produced in the array as the agent moves about the environment. The above example of objects \"growing\" or \"shrinking\" as an observer moves towards or away from them is an example of an optical flow invariant, as the array will always transform like this under those conditions. Gibson hypothesized that agents evolved to \"directly\" access relevant information about themselves and the environment from the invariant structures in the array, without the need for high level cognitive computations. In other words, in the aforementioned case of objects appearing to grow or shrink, no cognitive processes mediate the observer sensing the apparent growth in size of the object and the observer perceiving that she has now moved toward the object (or the object has moved toward her).\n\nThese invariant properties are linked with Gibson's idea of affordances. According to Gibson, an affordance is a property of the environment, much like color and size are. For an animal with the appropriate physiological equipment, a tree affords the ability to climb up it, or the ground the ability to walk upon it. Therefore, he claimed, affordances are also specified in the ambient optic array. This means that not only can an agent directly perceive that there is a horizontal surface or that a tree is a tree, but that a horizontal surface is \"walk-on-able\" or that a tree is \"climb-up-able\". In fact, the agent's perceptual system is so attuned to the invariant information, Gibson argues, that the agent need not consult any of its prior experiences in order to interact with the environment. This implies that agents pick-up meaning and value directly from the environment, rather than project it onto the world.\n\nMany critics have rejected at least some of Gibson's claims. Psychologist Richard Gregory asserted that Gibson's bottom-up approach to perception is incomplete. He argued that visual illusions like the Necker cube are the result of the brain's indecision between two equally plausible hypotheses about the cube's orientation. The cube appears to \"flip\" between these two orientations even though the sensory information remains static. Therefore, Gregory reasoned that top-down processes must mediate perception. In response, Gibson argued that illusions like the Necker cube are the result of artifice and would not be encountered by agents in realistic perceptual situations, and therefore are irrelevant. However, the waterfall illusion is an example of a naturally occurring illusion and cannot be accounted for by Gibson's theory. Nevertheless, these two approaches can be reconciled. For example, Ulric Neisser developed the perceptual cycle, which involves top-down and bottom-up perceptual processes interacting and informing each other. The processes are causally linked, but of equal importance.\n\nFurthermore, David Marr claimed that Gibson had profoundly underestimated the intricacy of visual information processing. While useful information may exist directly in the ambient optic array, Gibson does not elaborate on the mechanisms of the direct pick-up of this information. Marr argues that this is a complex information processing problem, and not as simple as Gibson makes it out to be.\n\n"}

It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger. The property of being easily annoyed is called irritability.\n\nVarious reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly. Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure. One can often encounter this phenomenon with such media as popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which by their very nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months.\n\nA study published in the \"International Journal of Conflict Management\" found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved. It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated.\n\nPsychological warfare can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) played music \"specifically selected for its irritation ability\" on loudspeakers outside the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in an attempt to bring about the surrender of David Koresh and his followers.\n\nIn the sense of \"nuisance\", the noun \"annoyance\" is found in the English \"Jury of Annoyance\" appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the highways.\n\n"}
{"id": "26829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26829", "title": "Category of sets", "text": "Category of sets\n\nIn the mathematical field of category theory, the category of sets, denoted as Set, is the category whose objects are sets. The arrows or morphisms between sets \"A\" and \"B\" are the total functions from \"A\" to \"B\", and the composition of morphisms is the composition of functions.\n\nMany other categories (such as the category of groups, with group homomorphisms as arrows) add structure to the objects of the category of sets and/or restrict the arrows to functions of a particular kind.\n\nThe axioms of a category are satisfied by Set because composition of functions is associative, and because every set \"X\" has an identity function \"id : X → X\" which serves as identity element for function composition.\n\nThe epimorphisms in Set are the surjective maps, the monomorphisms are the injective maps, and the isomorphisms are the bijective maps.\n\nThe empty set serves as the initial object in Set with empty functions as morphisms. Every singleton is a terminal object, with the functions mapping all elements of the source sets to the single target element as morphisms. There are thus no zero objects in Set. \n\nThe category Set is complete and co-complete. The product in this category is given by the cartesian product of sets. The coproduct is given by the disjoint union: given sets \"A\" where \"i\" ranges over some index set \"I\", we construct the coproduct as the union of \"A\"×{\"i\"} (the cartesian product with \"i\" serves to ensure that all the components stay disjoint).\n\nSet is the prototype of a concrete category; other categories are concrete if they are \"built on\" Set in some well-defined way.\n\nEvery two-element set serves as a subobject classifier in Set. The power object of a set \"A\" is given by its power set, and the exponential object of the sets \"A\" and \"B\" is given by the set of all functions from \"A\" to \"B\". Set is thus a topos (and in particular cartesian closed and exact in the sense of Barr).\n\nSet is not abelian, additive nor preadditive.\n\nEvery non-empty set is an injective object in Set. Every set is a projective object in Set (assuming the axiom of choice).\n\nThe finitely presentable objects in Set are the finite sets. Since every set is a direct limit of its finite subsets, the category Set is a locally finitely presentable category.\n\nIf \"C\" is an arbitrary category, the contravariant functors from \"C\" to Set are often an important object of study. If \"A\" is an object of \"C\", then the functor from \"C\" to Set that sends \"X\" to Hom(\"X\",\"A\") (the set of morphisms in \"C\" from \"X\" to \"A\") is an example of such a functor. If \"C\" is a small category (i.e. the collection of its objects forms a set), then the contravariant functors from \"C\" to Set, together with natural transformations as morphisms, form a new category, a functor category known as the category of presheaves on \"C\".\n\nIn Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory the collection of all sets is not a set; this follows from the axiom of foundation. One refers to collections that are not sets as proper classes. One cannot handle proper classes as one handles sets; in particular, one cannot write that those proper classes belong to a collection (either a set or a proper class). This is a problem: it means that the category of sets cannot be formalized straightforwardly in this setting. Categories like Set whose collection of objects forms a proper class are known as large categories, to distinguish them from the small categories whose objects form a set. \n\nOne way to resolve the problem is to work in a system that gives formal status to proper classes, such as NBG set theory. In this setting, categories formed from sets are said to be \"small\" and those (like Set) that are formed from proper classes are said to be \"large\".\n\nAnother solution is to assume the existence of Grothendieck universes. Roughly speaking, a Grothendieck universe is a set which is itself a model of ZF(C) (for instance if a set belongs to a universe, its elements and its powerset will belong to the universe). The existence of Grothendieck universes (other than the empty set and the set formula_1 of all hereditarily finite sets) is not implied by the usual ZF axioms; it is an additional, independent axiom, roughly equivalent to the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals. Assuming this extra axiom, one can limit the objects of Set to the elements of a particular universe. (There is no \"set of all sets\" within the model, but one can still reason about the class \"U\" of all inner sets, i.e., elements of \"U\".)\n\nIn one variation of this scheme, the class of sets is the union of the entire tower of Grothendieck universes. (This is necessarily a proper class, but each Grothendieck universe is a set because it is an element of some larger Grothendieck universe.) However, one does not work directly with the \"category of all sets\". Instead, theorems are expressed in terms of the category Set whose objects are the elements of a sufficiently large Grothendieck universe \"U\", and are then shown not to depend on the particular choice of \"U\". As a foundation for category theory, this approach is well matched to a system like Tarski–Grothendieck set theory in which one cannot reason directly about proper classes; its principal disadvantage is that a theorem can be true of all Set but not of Set.\n\nVarious other solutions, and variations on the above, have been proposed.\n\nThe same issues arise with other concrete categories, such as the category of groups or the category of topological spaces.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11030380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11030380", "title": "Claim rights and liberty rights", "text": "Claim rights and liberty rights\n\nSome philosophers and political scientists make a distinction between claim rights and liberty rights. A \"claim right\" is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. In contrast, a \"liberty right\" is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. The distinction between these two senses of \"rights\" originates in American jurist Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld's analysis thereof in his seminal work \"Fundamental Legal Conceptions, As Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays\".\n\nLiberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited. This is because the deontic concepts of obligation and permission are De Morgan dual; a person is permitted to do all and only the things he is not obliged to refrain from, and obliged to do all and only the things he is not permitted to refrain from.\n\nA person's \"liberty right to x\" consists in his freedom to do or have \"x\", while a person's \"claim right to x\" consists in an obligation on others to allow or enable him to do or have \"x\". For example, to assert a \"liberty right\" to free speech is to assert that you have permission to speak freely; that is, that you are not doing anything wrong by speaking freely. But that liberty right does not in itself entail that others are obligated to help you communicate the things you wish to say, or even that they would be wrong in preventing you from speaking freely. To say these things would be to assert a \"claim right\" to free speech; to assert that others are obliged to refrain (i.e. prohibited) from preventing you from speaking freely (that is, that it would be wrong for them to do so) or even perhaps obliged to aid your efforts at communication (that is, it would be wrong for them to refuse such aid). Conversely, such claim rights do not entail liberty rights; e.g. laws prohibiting vigilante justice (establishing a legal claim right to be free thereof) do not thereby condone or permit all the acts which such violent enforcement might otherwise have prevented.\n\nTo illustrate, a world with only liberty rights, without any claim rights, would by definition be a world wherein everything was permitted and no act or omission was prohibited; a world wherein none could rightly claim that they had been wronged or neglected. Conversely, a world with only claim rights and no liberty rights would be a world wherein nothing was merely permitted, but all acts were either obligatory or prohibited. The assertion that people have a claim right to liberty – i.e. that people are obliged only to refrain from preventing each other from doing things which are permissible, their liberty rights limited only by the obligation to respect others' liberty – is the central thesis of liberal theories of justice.\n\nHohfeld's original analysis included two other types of right: besides \"claims\" (or \"rights\" proper) and \"liberties\" (or \"privileges\"), he wrote of \"powers\", and \"immunities\". The other two terms of Hohfeld's analysis, \"powers\" and \"immunities\", refer to second-order liberties and claims, respectively. Powers are liberty rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. the U.S. Congress has certain powers to modify some of U.S. citizens' legal rights, inasmuch as it can impose or remove legal duties. Immunities, conversely, are claim rights regarding the modification of first-order rights, e.g. U.S. citizens have, per their Constitution, certain immunities limiting the positive powers of the U.S. Congress to modify their legal rights. As such, immunities and powers are often subsumed within claims and liberties by later authors, or grouped together into \"active rights\" (liberties and powers) and \"passive rights\" (claims and immunities).\n\nThese different types of rights can be used as building blocks to explain relatively complex matters such as a particular piece of property. For example, a right to use one's computer can be thought of as a liberty right, but one has a power right to let somebody else use your computer (granting them a liberty right), as well as a claim right against others using the computer; and further, you may have \"immunity rights\" protecting your claims and liberties regarding the computer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3286366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3286366", "title": "Cognitive specialization", "text": "Cognitive specialization\n\nCognitive specialization suggests that certain behaviors, often in the domain of social communication, are passed on to offspring and refined to be maximally beneficial by the process of natural selection. Specializations serve an adaptive purpose for an organism by allowing the organism to be better suited for its habitat. Over time, specializations often become essential to the species' continued survival. Cognitive specialization in humans has been thought to underlie the acquisition, development, and evolution of language, theory of mind, and specific social skills such as trust and reciprocity. These specializations are considered to be critical to the survival of the species, even though there are successful individuals who lack certain specializations, including those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder or who lack language abilities. Cognitive specialization is also believed to underlie adaptive behaviors such as self-awareness, navigation, and problem solving skills in several animal species such as chimpanzees and bottlenose dolphins.\n\nFirst studied as an adaptive mechanism specific to humans, cognitive specialization has since evolved to encompass many behaviors in the social realm. Organisms have evolved over millions of years to become well-adapted to their habitats; this requires becoming specialized in behaviors that improve an organism’s likelihood of survival and reproduction. Not to be confused with functional specialization, which examines the specific parts of the brain that are engaged during specific behaviors or processes, cognitive specialization is focused on characteristics of the mind (an internal entity), which in turn affects external behaviors. Most of these specializations are thought to have developed in areas of the neocortex unique to humans. The most significant cognitive specializations among humans include theory of mind and language acquisition and production, while non-human animals may specialize in foraging behavior, self-awareness, or other adaptive abilities.\n\nSocial communication is critical to effective human interaction, and has evolved over time to support the complex exchange of ideas. Some social behaviors, such as helping and altruism, are largely unique to humans and are instrumental in ensuring the survival of the species. Evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby argue that the human mind contains \"specialized mechanisms\" that were designed by natural selection to facilitate social communication and exchange. Without this specialized \"algorithm\", Cosmides and Tooby claim, social exchange among humans would be closer to that of our closest evolutionary ancestors, the great apes. In addition to humans' broad abilities supporting positive social interaction, Stone et al. (2002) put forth evidence for more specific specializations including \"cheater detection\" and \"precautionary reasoning,\" both of which appear to serve strong adaptive purposes by allowing humans to share resources with only those who are likely to share with them in the future, and avoid sharing resources with untrustworthy individuals. Overall, the adaptiveness of social communication has been examined in children, adults, and older adults, across cultures, and in neuropsychiatric populations.\n\nIf social behavior is to be considered a cognitive specialization unique to human neural architecture, it should be present in every human society. To provide cross-cultual evidence that cognitive adaptations specifically support social communication, Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosmides investigated social reasoning in a tribe in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The Shiwiar, who are a hunter-horticulturalist group previously unexposed to the presented psychological stimuli, were \"as highly proficient\" in determining who cheated in a given situation as their counterparts in the United States. This performance indicates that social communication, at least in the domain of cheater detection, is not determined by one's culture. According to Sugiyama, Tooby, and Cosimdes, the social \"algorithms\" discussed above are present in both Western and non-Western populations, providing strong evidence for the universality of such a skill.\n\nTheory of mind, or the ability to attribute mental states to other people, is thought to be a cognitive specialization unique to humans, with a few possible exceptions discussed below. Theory of mind is thought to be critical in social cognition and communication because it allows us to distinguish between accidental and purposeful actions, to make judgments about others' internal states, and to determine how another's thoughts may differ from our own. The acquisition of theory of mind in humans mostly takes place during early childhood, and is thought to be fully developed by the early school years. Theory of mind research in chimpanzees by social psychologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff in 1978 brought it to the forefront of psychological inquiry, though true theory of mind is only thought to exist in humans. This phenomenon has been analyzed in many fields, and it is thought to be among the most beneficial specializations for survival of the human species, due to its facilitation of cooperation and interpersonal relationships.\n\nTheory of mind appears to be lacking in children with autism spectrum disorders, and this deficit is thought to be a major contributor to frequent impairments in some areas of social understanding in people with autism. The fact that a developmental delay in (or absence of) theory of mind can impair social functioning—a skill imperative in the survival of the human species—is argued to be evidence for theory of mind as an adaptive cognitive specialization. Understanding that others may be thinking different thoughts than I am (colloquially, \"putting oneself in another person's shoes\") allows humans to communicate effectively and to live in large social groups. This adaptability is what makes theory of mind a cognitive specialization, rather than just another byproduct of human evolution: humankind has unique and beneficial communication skills, and this is partially due to our ability to recognize that other people may not think or know the same things we do.\n\nThough some (including Bates et al.) have argued that language arose as a byproduct of the evolution of humans' general cognitive abilities, Steven Pinker argues that it is, on its own, an adaptive mechanism. Drawing on existing literature and theory, he proposes several types of evidence for this claim, including the universality and ontogeny of language. Pinker also uses the double dissociation between general intelligence and language to argue for language as a specific adaptation. Those who lose language capabilities due to traumatic brain injury or stroke but maintain many other cognitive abilities exemplify Pinker's idea that language and general cognition are not always perfectly overlapping in human behavior. Using language \"multiplies the benefit of knowledge\" in multiple domains, including technology, tool use, and intentions of ourselves and others.\n\nArbib puts forth a hypothesis that mirror neurons in the primate brain were a precursor to language abilities in humans. Without these neurons in Broca's area in humans (which is analogous to F5 in monkeys), Arbib claims, we could not have evolved a specialization for language—which is used to explain why non-human animals do not have linguistic capabilities. In addition, Meguerditchian and Vauclair have argued that our evolutionary ancestors' communicative gestures (such as threat gestures and \"food begs\" among baboons) established a foundation on which to build human language skills. This behavior was selected for, built upon, and modified, leading to the capabilities humans have today. Early theories explained early language as an adaptive way to communicate during a hunt, but recent research has focused on ecological theories that incorporate social demands; or, as Flinn et al. put it, a \"social arms race\" against non-human primates. As a behavior selected for over the long term, with many successful \"intermediary stages,\" human language differs from all other social behaviors among chimpanzees, which are thought to be more gradual in their evolutionary development. Further evidence for language as a cognitive specialization includes Ferreira et al.'s finding that some parts of language (for instance, syntax) can be spared in amnesia, while other abilities (like memory retention) are drastically reduced. This and similar dissociations support the theory that specific neural architecture, which has evolved over time, supports language function.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky proposed a biological component of language, which he termed Universal Grammar. According to Chomsky, an essential part of language processing is hard-wired into the human brain. This allows language to be produced with or without specific linguistic instruction (which is closely associated with the poverty of the stimulus argument). All humans—and only humans—have this biological trait, but building blocks of universal grammar have been reported in other species. Jackendoff argues that Universal Grammar is itself a \"pre-existing cognitive specialization\": rather than needing explicit instruction on how to speak their native language, or having vocabulary and syntactical rules of a specific language present in their brains from birth, children seem to be genetically pre-disposed to \"learn\" language. Complementary to the connection made between area F5 in macaques' brains, the theory of Universal Grammar allows for an evolutionary perspective on language use as a cognitive specialization. There is some controversy, however, on whether or not Universal Grammar can have evolved by standard Darwinian evolutionary principles, or must be explained using different mechanisms.\n\nAccording to Nowak and Sigmund, language is essential to human life as we know it. Without the ability to verbally communicate with members of our social group, there would be no reciprocity (that is, returning of favors), and no way to cooperate with one another for a greater good. Some have argued that unique aspects of human language have evolved for unexpectedly beneficial reasons, besides simply asking for help or sharing information about the world. Gossip, viewed by many to be a superfluous aspect of human communication, may even serve an adaptive purpose. The spread of information about other people, even if it is malicious, may serve as an indicator of social intelligence and a way to deter illicit behaviors. Though gossip likely helps some humans and hinders others' social standing, it appears to be an overall benefit of the ability to produce verbal language. Without an overall specialization for language (including such sub-specializations as gossip), linguists argue, humans would not be able to share information efficiently and effectively.\n\nWatson et al. provide support for a specific specialization in language-dependent humor. Its adaptive value has both extrinsic and intrinsic components: humor facilitates social bonding if shared extrinsically, and provides pleasure if enjoyed in one's own mind. In addition, Johnson-Frey (2003) proposed a unique human specialization for tool use. According to Johnson-Frey, humans' ability to use tools is based on complex cognitive mechanisms, not just advanced sensorimotor skills. Rather than it being considered a purely physical specialization based only in motor areas of the brain, Johnson-Frey argues that tool use should be classified as a cognitive phenomenon due to its foundation in cognition. On a more philosophical level, Boyer (2003) argues that \"religious thought and behavior\" is a specialization that originally developed as a by-product of brain function, and its adaptive purposes led to its continued evolution by natural selection. Krueger et al. (2007) have argued that trust, which may form the foundation for helping and altruism and thus the basis of human social interaction, is also a cognitive specialization.\n\nHumankind’s closest ancestors, the great apes, have evolved a number of specialized behaviors: orangutans are specialists at climbing trees, while chimpanzees and gorillas have evolved to walk on their knuckles. However, in considering non-behavioral specializations, Penn et al. (2008) argue that the \"profound continuity\" Charles Darwin noted between human and non-human animals in the biological domain is matched by a \"profound discontinuity\" between human and non-human animal minds. In contrast, in addition to cognitive-behavioral adaptations, it is possible that chimpanzees have acquired more socially advanced skills through natural selection, including self-recognition (indicated by chimpanzees' established ability to pass the \"mirror test\"). This task—in which a successful trial is simply one in which an animal recognizes itself in a mirror—is thought to be a basic building block of theory of mind development. Rhesus monkeys have also been shown to realize when they remember certain events and items, which is considered to be an instrumental building block in the formation of social relationships, as one must remember who owes him favors, who he can trust, and who he should avoid in order to prosper in the community.\n\nMore recent evidence has shown that cognitive specialization is not just present in primates: domesticated dogs may show signs of understanding human behavior and communication, indicating a social-cognitive specialization that is argued to make them more likely to receive food, shelter and love from their human owners. Being receptive to human behavioral indicators and responding accordingly has allowed dogs to survive and thrive as a species. Bottlenose dolphins and elephants have also been shown to pass the \"mirror test\" explained above. This indication of some elementary self-awareness provides more evidence for foundational theory of mind skills in organisms throughout the animal kingdom. Ants, bees, and other insects have also evolved behaviors consistent with various specializations, including advanced navigational skills and several basic social communication abilities. Adaptive cognitive evolution has been examined in pigeons' ability to group objects (which is argued to support their processing of and adaptation to novel environments), problem solving and \"creative\" tool modification among rooks, and tool use in crows.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8503698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8503698", "title": "Complexity economics", "text": "Complexity economics\n\nComplexity economics is the application of complexity science to the problems of economics. It sees the economy not as a system in equilibrium, but as one in motion, perpetually constructing itself anew. It uses computational rather than mathematical analysis to explore how economic structure is formed and reformed, in continuous interaction with the adaptive behavior of the 'agents' in the economy \n\nThe \"nearly archetypal example\" is an artificial stock market model created by the Santa Fe Institute in 1989. The model shows two different outcomes, one where \"agents do not search much for predictors and there is convergence on a homogeneous rational expectations outcome\" and another where \"all kinds of technical trading strategies appearing and remaining and periods of bubbles and crashes occurring\".\n\nAnother area has studied the prisoner's dilemma, such as in a network where agents play amongst their nearest neighbors or a network where the agents can make mistakes from time to time and \"evolve strategies\". In these models, the results show a system which displays \"a pattern of constantly changing distributions of the strategies\".\n\nMore generally, complexity economics models are often used to study how non-intuitive results at the macro-level of a system can emerge from simple interactions at the micro level. This avoids assumptions of the representative agent method, which attributes outcomes in collective systems as the simple sum of the rational actions of the individuals.\n\nMIT physicist César Hidalgo and Harvard economist Ricardo Hausmann introduced a spectral method to measure the complexity of a country's economy by inferring it from the structure of the network connecting countries to the products that they export. The measure combines information of a country's diversity, which is positively correlated with a country's productive knowledge, with measures of a product ubiquity (number of countries that produce or export the product). This concept, known as the \"Product Space\", has been further developed by MIT's Observatory of Economic Complexity, and in The Atlas of Economic Complexity in 2011.\n\nThe economic complexity index (ECI) introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann is highly predictive of future GDP per capita growth. In Hausmann, Hidalgo et al., the authors show that the List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates ability of the ECI to predict future GDP per capita growth is between 5 times and 20 times larger than the World Bank's measure of governance, the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) and standard measures of human capital, such as years of schooling and cognitive ability.\n\nPietronero and collaborators have recently proposed a different approach. These metrics are defined as the fixed point of non-linear iterative map. Differently from the linear algorithm giving rise to the ECI, this non-linearity is a key point to properly deal with the nested structure of the data. The authors of this alternative formula claim it has several advantages:\n\n\nThe metrics for country fitness and product complexity have been used in a report of the Boston Consulting Group on Sweden growth and development perspectives.\n\nBrian Arthur, Steven N. Durlauf, and David A. Lane describe several features of complex systems that deserve greater attention in economics.\n\n\nComplexity economics has a complex relation to previous work in economics and other sciences, and to contemporary economics. Complexity-theoretic thinking to understand economic problems has been present since their inception as academic disciplines. Research has shown that no two separate micro-events are completely isolated, and there is a relationship that forms a macroeconomic structure. However, the relationship is not always in one direction; there is a reciprocal influence when feedback is in operation.\n\nComplexity economics has been applied to many fields.\n\nComplexity economics draws inspiration from behavioral economics, Marxian economics, institutional economics/evolutionary economics, Austrian economics and the work of Adam Smith. It also draws inspiration from other fields, such as statistical mechanics in physics, and evolutionary biology. Some of the 20th century intellectual background of complexity theory in economics is examined in Alan Marshall (2002) The Unity of Nature, Imperial College Press: London. See Douma & Schreuder (2017) for a non-technical introduction to Complexity Economics and a comparison with other economic theories (as applied to markets and organizations).\n\nThe theory of complex dynamic systems has been applied in diverse fields in economics and other decision sciences. These applications include capital theory, game theory, the dynamics of opinions among agents composed of multiple selves, and macroeconomics. In voting theory, the methods of symbolic dynamics have been applied by Donald G. Saari. Complexity economics has attracted the attention of historians of economics. Ben Ramalingam's Aid on the Edge of Chaos includes numerous applications of complexity economics that are relevant to foreign aid.\n\nAccording to , , and contemporary mainstream economics is evolving to be more \"eclectic\", diverse, and pluralistic. state that contemporary mainstream economics is \"moving away from a strict adherence to the holy trinity – rationality, selfishness, and equilibrium\", citing complexity economics along with recursive economics and dynamical systems as contributions to these trends. They classify complexity economics as now mainstream but non-orthodox.\n\nIn 1995-1997 publications, \"Scientific American\" journalist John Horgan \"ridiculed\" the movement as being the fourth \"C\" among the \"failed fads\" of \"complexity, chaos, catastrophe, and cybernetics\". In 1997, Horgan wrote that the approach had \"created some potent metaphors: the butterfly effect, fractals, artificial life, the edge of chaos, self organized criticality. But they have not told us anything about the world that is both concrete and truly surprising, either in a negative or in a positive sense.\"\n\nRosser \"granted\" Horgan \"that it is hard to identify a concrete and surprising discovery (rather than \"mere metaphor\") that has arisen due to the emergence of complexity analysis\" in the discussion journal of the American Economic Association, the \"Journal of Economic Perspectives\". Surveying economic studies based on complexity science, Rosser wrote that the findings, rather than being surprising, confirmed \"already-observed facts.\" Rosser wrote that there has been \"little work on empirical techniques for testing dispersed agent complexity models.\" Nonetheless, Rosser wrote that \"there is a strain of common perspective that has been accumulating as the four C's of cybernetics, catastrophe, chaos, and complexity emerged, which may now be reaching a critical mass in terms of influencing the thinking of economists more broadly.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Are interventions at all possible? How can we find an “autonomy of practice” that is both critical and transformative?\n\nIn 2010 the institute was honored with a Prince Claus Award, a major cultural development award from the Netherlands.

It may be classified as a type of factitious disorder or as a medical fetishism.\n\nOne theory is that pretenders may be the \"missing link\" between devotees and wannabes, demonstrating an assumed continuum between those merely attracted to people with disabilities and those who actively wish to become disabled. Many wannabes use pretending as a way to appease the intense emotional pain related to having body integrity identity disorder.\n\nPretending takes a variety of forms. Some chatroom users on internet sites catering to devotees have complained that chat counterparts they assumed were female were revealed as male devotees. This form of pretending (where a devotee derives pleasure by pretending to be a disabled woman) may indicate a very broad predisposition to pretending among devotees.\n\nPretending includes dressing and acting in ways typical of disabled people, including making use of aids (Walking sticks, crutches, wheelchairs, mobility scooters, white canes, etc). Pretending may also take the form of a devotee persuading his or her sexual partner to play the role of a disabled person. Pretending may be practised in private, in intimacy, or in public, and may occupy surprisingly long periods. In the latter case, some pretenders hope that the disability may become permanent, such as through tissue necrosis caused by constricted blood supply.\n\nPeople with this condition may refer to themselves as \"transabled\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "693320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=693320", "title": "Dismemberment", "text": "Dismemberment\n\nDismemberment is the act of cutting, tearing, pulling, wrenching or otherwise removing the limbs of a living thing. It has been practised upon human beings as a form of capital punishment, especially in connection with regicide, but can occur as a result of a traumatic accident, or in connection with murder, suicide, or cannibalism. As opposed to surgical amputation of the limbs, dismemberment is often fatal to all but the simplest of creatures. In criminology, a distinction is made between offensive and defensive dismemberment. Intentional, criminal dismemberment is known as \"mayhem\".\n\nParticularly in South-Eastern Asia, execution by trained elephants was a form of capital punishment practiced for several centuries. The techniques by which the convicted person was actually executed varied widely but did, on occasion, include the elephant dismembering the victim by means of sharp blades attached to its feet. The Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta, visiting Delhi in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:\n\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire emperor Charles V's 1532 Constitutio Criminalis Carolina specifies how \"every\" dismemberment (quartering) should ideally occur:\nThus, the imperially approved way to dismember the convict within the Holy Roman Empire was by means of \"cutting\", rather than dismemberment through \"ripping\" the individual apart. In paragraph 124 of the same code, beheading prior to quartering is mentioned as allowable when extenuating circumstances are present, whereas aggravating circumstances may allow pinching/ripping the criminal with glowing pincers, prior to quartering.\n\nThe fate of Wilhelm von Grumbach in 1567, a maverick knight in the Holy Roman Empire who was fond of making his own private wars and was thus condemned for treason, is also worthy of note. Gout-ridden, he was carried to the execution site in a chair and bound fast to a table. The executioner then ripped out his heart, and stuck it in von Grumbach's face with the words: \"von Grumbach! Behold your false heart!\" Afterwards, the executioner quartered von Grumbach's body. His principal associate was given the same treatment, and an eyewitness avers (confirms) that \"after\" his heart had been ripped out, Chancellor Brück screamed horribly for \"quite some time\".\n\nOne example of a highly aggravated execution is illustrated by the fate of Bastian Karnhars on 16 July 1600. Karnhars was found guilty of 52 separate acts of murder, including the rape and murder of 8 women, and the murder of a child, whose heart he had allegedly eaten for rituals of black magic. To begin, Karnhars had three strips of flesh torn from his back, before being pinched 18 times with glowing pincers, having his fingers clipped off one by one, his arms and legs broken on the wheel, and finally, while still alive, quartered.\nIn the seventeenth century, a number of travel reports speak of an exotic \"Turkish\" execution method, where first, the waist of a man was constricted by ropes and cords, and then a swift bisection of the trunk was performed. William Lithgow presents a comparatively prosaic description of the method:\n\nGeorge Sandys, however, during the same period, tells of a method as no longer in use, in a rather more mythologized way:\n\nIn 1850s Persia, a particular dismemberment technique called \"shekkeh\" is reported to have been used. Travelling as an official for the East India Company Robert Binning describes it as follows:\n\nDismemberment was a form of capital punishment for convicts of high treason in the Korean kingdom of the Joseon Dynasty. This punishment was, for example, meted out to Hwang Sa-Yong in 1801.\nThe Five Pains is a Chinese variation invented during the Qin dynasty. During the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE), truncation of the body at the waist by means of a fodder knife was a death penalty reserved for those who were seen to have done something particularly treacherous or repugnant. That practice of cutting in two did not originate in the Tang dynasty; in sources concerning the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), no less than 33 cases of execution by cutting at the waist are mentioned, but occurs very rarely in earlier material.\n\nDismemberment is no longer used by most modern governments as a form of execution or torture, though amputation is still carried out in countries that practice Sharia law.\n\nDismemberment was carried out in the Medieval and Early Modern era and could be effected, for example, by tying a person's limbs to chains or other restraints, then attaching the restraints to separate movable entities (e.g. vehicles) and moving them in opposite directions.\n\nAlso referred to as \"disruption\" or being \"drawn and quartered\", dismemberment could be brought about by chaining four horses to the condemned's arms and legs, thus making them pull him apart, as was the case with the executions of François Ravaillac in 1610 and Robert-François Damiens in 1757. Ravaillac's extended torture and execution has been described like this: \nIn the case of Damiens, he was condemned to essentially the same fate as Ravaillac, but the execution did not quite work according to plan, as the eyewitness Giacomo Casanova could relate: \n\nAs late as in 1781, this gruesome punishment was meted out to the Peruvian rebel leader Túpac Amaru II by the Spanish colonial authorities. The following is an extract from the official judicial death sentence issued by the Spanish authorities which condemns Túpac Amaru II to torture and death. It was ordered in the sentence that Túpac Amaru II be condemned to have his tongue cut out, after watching the executions of his family, and to have his hands and feet tied... \n\nQueen Brunhilda of Austrasia, executed in 613, is generally regarded to have suffered the same death, though one account has it that she was tied to the tail of a single horse and thus suffered more of a dragging death. The Liber Historiae Francorum, an eighth century chronicle, describes her death by dismemberment as follows:\nThe story of Brunhilda being tied to the tail of a \"single\" horse (and then to die in some gruesome manner) is promoted, for example, by Ted Byfield (2003), in which he writes: \"Then they tied her to the tail of a wild horse; whipped into frenzy, it kicked her to death\" The cited source for this claim, however, the seventh century \"Life of St. Columban\" by the monk Jonas, does not support this claim. In paragraph 58 in his work, Jonas just writes: \"..but Brunhilda he had placed first on a camel in mockery and so exhibited to all her enemies round about then she was bound to the tails of wild horses and thus perished wretchedly\"\n\nThe storyline of Brunhilde being tied to the tail of a single horse and being subsequently \"dragged\" to death has become a classical motif in artistic representations, as can be seen by the included image.\n\nAccording to Olfert Dapper, a 17th-century Dutchman who meticulously collected reports from faraway countries from seamen and other travelers, a fairly frequent maritime death penalty among the corsairs on the Barbary coast was to affix the hands and feet to chains on four different ships. When the ships then sailed off in different directions, the chains grew taut, and the man in between was torn apart after a while.\n\nRoman military discipline could be extremely severe, and the emperor Aurelian (r. 270–275 CE), who had a reputation for extreme strictness, instituted the rule that soldiers who seduced the wives of their hosts should have their legs fastened to two bent-down trees, which were then released, ripping the man in two. Similarly, in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor Valens in 366 CE, the usurper Procopius met the same fate.\n\nAfter the defeat of Darius III by Alexander the Great, the Persian monarchy was thrown into turmoil, and Darius was killed. One man, Bessus, claimed the throne as Artaxerxes V, but in 329 BCE, Alexander had him executed. The manner of Bessus' death is rather disputed, and Waldemar Heckel writes:\nThe method of tying people to bent down trees, which are then allowed to recoil, ripping the individual to pieces in the process is, however, mentioned by several travelers to nineteenth century Persia. The British diplomat James Justinian Morier travelled as a special envoy to the Shah in 1808, and Morier writes the following concerning then prevailing criminal justice:\n\nAn obscure Christian martyr, Severianus was, about the year 300 AD, martyred in the following way, according to one tale: One stone was fastened to his head, another bound to his feet. His middle was then fastened by a rope to the top of a wall, and the stones released from the height. His body was ripped apart.\n\nDuring the reign of the Roman Emperor Diocletian a Christian named Shamuna was, allegedly, torn apart in the following manner:\nSome time thereafter, Shamuna was taken down from his hanging position, and was beheaded instead.\n\nThere are many instances of dismemberment in murder cases. Examples of victims include Bernard Oliver, Bill Nelson, Jana Claudia Gómez Menéndez, Jessica Ridgeway, Becky Watts, Ingrid Lyne, Jamal Khashoggi and Kim Wall. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is also known to have dismembered and cannibalized his victims.\n\n\nDismemberment has been portrayed in many films; although a few are depictions of historical or actual events, a significant number are within the horror genre. Filmmakers can be quite innovative in the methods depicted, and thus reflect the public's fear and fascination with this method of torture, homicide, and/or body disposal. The following movies portray or imply dismemberment in some form; exceptional methods or motives are described.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12294713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12294713", "title": "Drake Landing Solar Community", "text": "Drake Landing Solar Community\n\nThe Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC) is a planned community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada, equipped with a central solar heating system and other energy efficient technology. This heating system is the first of its kind in North America, although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe. The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year-round heating by underground seasonal thermal energy storage (STES).\n\nThe system was designed to model a way of addressing global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. The solar energy is captured by 800 solar thermal collectors located on the roofs of all 52 houses' garages. It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in North America, although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources.\n\nIn 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97%; that is, providing that amount of the community's heating requirements with solar energy over a one-year time span.\n\nThere are 52 homes in this subdivision that contain an array of 800 solar thermal collectors. These solar collectors are arranged on the roofs of garages located behind the homes. During a typical summer day these collectors can generate 1.5 mega-watts of thermal power. A glycol solution (an anti-freeze solution; a mixture of water and non-toxic glycol) is heated by the sun’s energy and travels through insulated piping underground through a trench system to the heat exchanger within the community’s Energy Centre. This is known as the Solar Collector Loop. The glycol solution then transfers its heat to water located in the short-term storage tanks. The District Heating Loop begins with water being heated in the heat exchanger to a temperature of 40-50 °C within the Energy Centre. This lower temperature is more energy efficient, as solar collecting is more compatible with lower temperatures. This increases the total amount of heat available to each home.\n\nIn the warmer months the previously heated water is taken from the short-term storage tank to the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage (BTES). The Borehole Thermal Energy Storage unit is 144 holes located below the ground and stretches over an approximate area of in diameter. The water returns to the short-term storage tanks in the Energy Centre to be heated again in order to complete the circuit. During colder months the water from the BTES passes back to the short-term storage tank and is then directed to each home. Similar to a hot water tank, the heated water goes through a heat exchanger that blows air across the warm fan coil. Heat travels from the water to the air and is directed through the house via ductwork. When the temperature reaches that said on the thermostat, an automatic valve shuts off the heat transfer unit.\n\nThe Energy Centre building is a 232 square metre (2,500 square feet) building which began operation in 2007. It is home to the short-term storage tanks and most mechanical equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, and controls. The Solar Collector Loop, the District Heating Loop, and the Borehole Thermal Energy Storage Loop pass through the Energy Centre. Two horizontal water tanks occupy the majority of the space within the Energy Centre. These tanks are in diameter and in length. The remaining space within the Energy Centre houses pumps, valves, heat exchangers and other necessary equipment to operate and control the energy system. These tanks are known as Short-Term Thermal Storage (STTS).\n\nThe Borehole Thermal Energy System is located underground to store large quantities of heat collected in the summer to be used in the winter. It consists of 144 boreholes, which stretch to a depth of . At the surface the pipes are joined together in groups of six to connect to the Energy Centre. The entire BTES is covered by a layer of insulation, on top of which a park is built. When the heated water is to be stored, it is pumped through the pipe series. The heat is then transferred to the surrounding soil as the water cools and returns to the Energy Centre. When the homes need heat, water flows to the centre of the BTES field and picks up the heat from the surrounding soil. The heated water then goes to the short-term energy tank in the Energy Centre and is pumped through the District Heating Loop to the homes.\n\nThis project was conceived by Natural Resources Canada’s CanmetENERGY in partnership with governmental organizations and Canadian industries. Of the $7 million needed for this project this was the breakdown of funds: \n\nHomeowners were willing to pay for these energy efficient homes because it ensured high quality construction. Until the solar heating system began working, ATCO Gas (an Alberta-based natural gas distribution company) fixed heating costs at $60 per month for the homeowners at the Drake Landing Solar Community. With rising fuel costs, this was a powerful incentive for homeowners to support the DLSC project. Even if the project had failed, ATCO Gas would have replaced the special hot-water furnaces with traditional natural gas ones. There was limited risk to the homeowners and this encouraged them to support the project.\n\nThe 52 homes in Drake Landing Solar Community are certified to Natural Resource Canada’s R-2000 Standard as well as the Built Green™ Alberta Gold Standard.\n\n\nA group of researchers from South Korea visited Drake Landing Solar Community in April 2012 to study the geothermal heating technology and how it can be applied to communities in South Korea, particularly ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The main focus of this research trip was to learn about the economics and reliability of the technology.\n\nOn October 5, 2012 the DLSC set a new world record by covering 97% of space heating needs with solar thermal energy. In the 2015-2016 heating season, 100% of space heating needs were met with solar energy.\n\n\n"}

Fishman and Geertz\" (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) United States District Court for the Central District of California).\n\nThe affidavit contained criticisms of the Church of Scientology and substantial portions of the Operating Thetan auditing and course materials.\n\nThe documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of \"Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz\". Along with Kendrick Moxon and Laurie Bartilson, Timothy Bowles was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.\n\nFishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to murder his psychologist, Dr. Uwe Geertz, and then commit suicide.Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman’s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.\n\nAs evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and Richard Ofshe, an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be copyrighted and a trade secret. Among other materials, the affidavit contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of Xenu.\n\nThe Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church's Religious Technology Center (RTC) brought copyright lawsuits over their release on the Internet. Fishman's description of OT VIII contains the accusation that Jesus was a pedophile. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.\n\nThe Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.\n\nAn important side aspect of the case was the fact that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.\n\nAmong others, declarations were submitted by:\n\n\nAlthough the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, converted to text, and posted onto the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology by ex-Scientologist Arnie Lerma. The material was then placed on the World Wide Web by David S. Touretzky.\n\nLerma's newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 raid of his home for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit \"Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post\". U.S. Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that while Richard Leiby and the Washington Post had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was \"to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics.\"\n\nAfter being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide. The Church of Scientology responded by suing a number of people and their Internet service providers for copyright infringement. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.\n\nThe other notable case in connection with this was against Dutch writer Karin Spaink. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology's attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines. The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting hyperlinking.\n\nCritics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as SLAPP suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or CCHR, and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims. Vicki Aznaran, a former Scientologist who was involved in anti-Scientology litigation before retracting her claims as part of a settlement with Scientology, gave a declaration through Scientology attorneys in which she states various allegations made by Steven Fishman and other church critics are untrue, contradicting her previous declaration given in \"CSI v. Fishman and Geertz\".\n\n\n"}

The term \"hova\" originally applied to all members of a Malagasy clan (possibly of the Zafiraminia people) that migrated into the central highlands from the southeast coast of the island around the 15th century and absorbed the existing population of Vazimba. Andriamanelo (1540–1575) consolidated the power of the Hova when he united many of the Hova chiefdoms around Antananarivo under his rule. The term Hova remained in use through the 20th century, though some foreigners transliterated that word to be \"Ankova\", and increasingly used since the 19th century.\n\nIn and after the 16th century, slaves were brought into Madagascar's various kingdoms, and social strata emerged in Merina kingdom. The Hova emerged as the free commoners caste below the nobles hierarchy. The subset of Hova related to the king by blood came under the title \"Andriana\". The social structure of the new kingdom became further defined under his son Ralambo (1575–1612), who further subdivided the Andriana into four ranks. Ralambo was also the first to use the term \"Imerina\" (land of the Merina) to describe the land occupied by the Hova people, who thereafter gradually adopted the identity and label of \"Merina\".\n\nThe warriors and soldiers occupation in the Merina society was traditionally selected from the Andriana caste, or from the nobles. Though in 19th century when Merina conquered the other kingdoms and ruled most of the island, a much larger army was needed, and the soldiers then included the Hova caste as well. The traditional occupation of the hova caste was managing rice and crop lands as owners and trading. The labor in the farms and other servitude was the occupation of the Andevo (slave) caste, also called the \"Mainty\" who were denied the right to own land. A Hova person could be reduced a slavery for crimes or a debt in default, and in this state he would be referred to as \"Zaza-hova\".\n\nThe Andriana, the Hova and the Andevo strata were endogamous in the Merina society. According to William Ellis memoir in 1838, a Hova in the Malagasy society was prohibited from marrying a noble or a slave, as well as a Zaza-hova. The exception, stated Ellis, was the unmarried Queen who could marry anyone from any strata including the Hova, and her children were deemed to be royal.\n\n\n"}

To fail to \"keep up with the Joneses\" is perceived as demonstrating socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase originated in a comic strip of the same name.\n\nThe phrase originates with the comic strip \"Keeping Up with the Joneses\", created by Arthur R. \"Pop\" Momand in 1913. The strip ran until 1940 in \"The New York World\" and various other newspapers. The strip depicts the social climbing McGinis family, who struggle to \"keep up\" with their neighbors, the Joneses of the title. The Joneses were unseen characters throughout the strip's run, often spoken of but never shown. The idiom \"keeping up with the Joneses\" has remained popular long after the strip's end.\n\nUse of the name \"Jones\" for neighbors involved in social comparison predates Momand's comic strip. In 1879, English writer E. J. Simmons wrote in \"Memoirs of a Station Master\" of the railroad station as a place for social exchange: \"The Joneses, who don't associate with the Robinsons, meet there.\" American humorist Mark Twain made an allusion to Smith and Jones families with regard to social custom in the essay \"Corn Pone Opinions,\" written in 1901 but first published in 1923. \"The outside influences are always pouring in upon us, and we are always obeying their orders and accepting their verdicts. The Smiths like the new play; the Joneses go to see it, and they copy the Smith verdict.\" Starting in 1908, D.W. Griffith directed a series of comedy shorts starring The Biograph Girl, Florence Lawrence, featuring the people next door, The Joneses.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the Joneses of the saying refer to the wealthy family of Edith Wharton's father, the Joneses. The Joneses were a prominent New York family with substantial interests in Chemical Bank as a result of marrying the daughters of the bank's founder, John Mason. The Joneses and other rich New Yorkers began to build country villas in the Hudson Valley around Rhinecliff and Rhinebeck, which had belonged to the Livingstons, another prominent New York family to whom the Joneses were related. The houses became grander and grander. In 1853, Elizabeth Schermerhorn Jones built a 24-room gothic villa called Wyndcliffe described by Henry Winthrop Sargent in 1859 as being very fine in the style of a Scottish castle, but by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth's niece, as a gloomy monstrosity. The villa reportedly spurred more building, including a house by William B. Astor (married to a Jones cousin), a phenomenon described as \"keeping up with the Joneses\". The phrase is also associated with another of Edith Wharton's aunts, Mary Mason Jones, who built a large mansion at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, then undeveloped. Wharton portrays her affectionately in \"The Age of Innocence\" as Mrs. Manson Mingott, \"calmly waiting for fashion to flow north\".\n\nA slightly different version is that the phrase refers to the grand lifestyle of the Joneses who by the mid-century were numerous and wealthy, thanks to the Chemical Bank and Mason connection. It was their relation Mrs William Backhouse Astor, Jr who began the \"patriarchs balls\", the origin of \"The Four Hundred\", the list of the society elite who were invited. By then the Joneses were being eclipsed by the massive wealth of the Astors, Vanderbilts and others but the four hundred list published in 1892 contained many of the Joneses and their relations—old money still mattered.\n\nThe philosophy of \"keeping up with the Joneses\" has widespread effects on some societies. According to this philosophy, conspicuous consumption occurs when people care about their standard of living in relation to their peers. The term was re-introduced in 1976 when an article about parenting included it and has remained a commercial and cultural watchword ever since.\n\nAccording to Roger Mason, \"the demand for status goods, fueled by \"conspicuous consumption\", has diverted many resources away from investment in the manufacture of more material goods and services in order to satisfy consumer preoccupations with their \"relative social standing\" and prestige\".\n\nSocial status once depended on one's family name; however, the rise of consumerism in the United States gave rise to social mobility. With the increasing availability of goods, people became more inclined to define themselves by what they possessed and the quest for higher status accelerated. Conspicuous consumption and materialism have been an insatiable juggernaut ever since. The desire to increase one's position in the social hierarchy is responsible for much of the social mobility in America. The upward mobility over the past few decades in America is due in part to the large number of women joining the labor force. U.S. women have slowly and steadily increased their participation in the labor force from 46% of all women (age 16+) in 1974 to almost 60% in 2004.\n\nEven in countries where the desire for upward social mobility via consumerism and conspicuous consumption is strong, the poor may not be able to better themselves. Doug Henwood observed that \"both the US and British poor were more likely to stay poor for a long period of time: almost half of all people who were poor for one year stayed poor for five or more years, compared with 30% in Canada and 36% in Germany. And, despite claims of great upward mobility in the United States, 45% of the poor rose out of poverty in a given year, compared with 45% in the UK, 53% in Germany, and 56% in Canada. And of those who did exit poverty, 15% of Americans were likely to make a round trip back under the poverty line, compared with 16% in Germany, 10% in the UK, and 7% in Canada\". The level of income inequality in a country has an inverse relationship with social mobility according to the authors of \"\".\n\nInability to \"keep up with the Joneses\" might result in dissatisfaction, even for people whose status is high.\n\nOne area in which \"living above one's means\" has caused negative social effects is that of credit card use. In the first quarter of 2002, total credit debt was $660 billion. By 2005, the total credit card debt had increased to $735 billion. America's average credit card debt in 2007 was $8,400 per household. By the end of 2007, consumer debt in America had risen to $2.5 trillion.\n\nIn the 1936 book \"The Next 100 Years\", Clifford C. Furnas writes that the phenomenon of \"'Keeping up with the Joneses' ... is descended from the spreading of the peacock's tail.\"\n\nThe phrase is also referenced in the song \"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)\" by Waylon Jennings.\n\nIn the UK, when Princess Margaret married the fashionable photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones in 1960, the media would sometimes mention 'keeping up with the Armstrong-Joneses'.\n\nAhmad Lewis has a song off his hit record called \"The Joneses.\"\n\nThe phrase appears in the song \"I Wanna Go Back\" by Christian singer David Dunn on his 2017 album \"Yellow Balloons.\"\n\nDominic West makes reference to the phrase “Keeping up with the Joneses” in the 2003 film Mona Lisa Smile.\n\nThe phrase is used as the title of the 2016 film \"Keeping Up with the Joneses\".\n\nThe phrase is also referenced in Marvel's \"Cloak & Dagger\" episode 10: \"In this day and age you gotta keep up with the Joneses, as well as the Starks and the Rands\"\n\nThe phrase is used in a Fallout 76 Trailer revolving around the game's building mechanics.\n\n"}
{"id": "17405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17405", "title": "Kowtow", "text": "Kowtow\n\nKowtow, which is borrowed from \"kau tau\" in Cantonese (\"koutou\" in Mandarin Chinese), is the act of deep respect shown by prostration, that is, kneeling and bowing so low as to have one's head touching the ground. An alternative Chinese term is \"ketou\"; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: \"kou\" (叩) has the general meaning of \"knock\", whereas \"ke\" (磕) has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", \"tou\" (頭) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the Spring and Autumn Period, or the Warring States Period of China's history because it is already known to have been a custom by the time of the Qin Dynasty (221 BC – 206 BC).\n\nIn East Asian culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the Emperor, as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has become reduced.\n\nIn Imperial Chinese protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. Immanuel Hsu describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the Imperial examinations is permitted a seat.\n\nSince one is required by Confucian philosophy to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\n\nConfucius believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind. Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\n\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the May Fourth Movement. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing bow has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.\n\nThe kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, Chinese martial arts schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.\n\nProstration is a general practice in Buddhism, and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either \"worship with the crown (of the head)\" (頂禮 ding li) or \"casting the five limbs to the earth\" (五體投地 wuti tou di)—referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows—stand up and kneel down again between each set—as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term \"three kneelings and nine head knockings\" (). Also, some Buddhist pilgrims would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the Triple Gem of Buddhism, the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.\n\nThe word \"kowtow\" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling. The term is still commonly used in English with this meaning, disconnected from the physical act and the East Asian context.\n\nThe kowtow was a significant issue for diplomats, since it was required to come into the presence of the Emperor of China, but it meant submission before him. The British embassies of George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney (1793) and William Pitt Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst (1816) were allegedly unsuccessful, partly because kowtowing would mean acknowledging their King as a subject of the Emperor.\n\nDutch ambassador Isaac Titsingh did not refuse to kowtow during the course of his 1794–1795 mission to the imperial court of the Qianlong Emperor. The members of the Titsingh mission, including Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest and Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes, made every effort to conform with the demands of the complex Imperial court etiquette.\n\nOn two occasions, the kowtow was performed by Chinese envoys to a foreign ruler – specifically the Russian Tsar. T'o-Shih, Qing emissary to Russia whose mission to Moscow took place in 1731, kowtowed before Tsarina Anna, as per instructions by the Yongzheng Emperor, as did Desin, who led another mission the next year to the new Russian capital at St. Petersburg. Hsu notes that Kanghsi Emperor, Yongzheng's predecessor, explicitly ordered that Russia be given a special status in Qing foreign relations by not being included among tributary states, i.e. recognition as an implicit equal of China. \n\nThe kowtow was often performed in intra-Asian diplomatic relations as well. In 1636, after being defeated by the invading Manchus, King Injo of Joseon (Korea) was forced to surrender by kowtowing three times to pledge tributary status to the Qing Emperor Hong Taiji. As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896 when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the First Sino-Japanese War.\n\nThe King of the Ryukyu Kingdom also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground (), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.\n\n"}
{"id": "38854360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38854360", "title": "Labia pride", "text": "Labia pride\n\nLabia pride is a feminist movement to raise awareness of the normal appearance of the vulva and to defy the trend towards cosmetic surgery on the female genitals (labiaplasty, also known as \"designer vagina\"). It is supported by several independent feminist groups and based on diverse channels of communication such as cyberfeminism, protest marches and advocating boycotts against physicians and clinics that make use of deceptive advertising.\n\nThe London-based feminist group UK Feminista organized a protest march through Harley Street, an area synonymous with its private medical providers, in December 2011. More than 320 women paraded the street, with slogans like: \"Keep your mits off our bits!\", \"There's nothing finer than my vagina!\", and \"Harley Street puts my chuff in a huff\" \n\nThe \"Muff March\" has been criticized for putting too much emphasis on pornography as a root cause of the problem. (See Feminist views on pornography.)\n\nThe growing demand for labiaplasty surgery is sometimes attributed to the idea that many women, as well as men, have unrealistic expectations regarding genital appearance. Almost all explicit depictions of female genitalia that people are confronted with are produced by the sex industry. Pornography is usually produced in a commercial context and primarily addresses male customers. Therefore, these depictions of female genitalia are often \"beautified\" to suit commercial need (or in some countries for legal reasons), either by the selection of models with a certain anatomy or by photoshopping the images. In practice, this means smoothing out irregularities and \"digitally shortening\" the labia minora.\n\nSeveral feminist groups, such as the \"Large Labia Project\" or \"Courageous Cunts\" try to oppose the influence that pornography has on anatomic expectations. By encouraging women to release images of their vulvas and post photo submissions of anonymous vulvas on their websites, they want to establish a sphere for women to get realistic impressions of normal vulvas.\n\nHowever, the campaign itself has been criticized. By giving the false impression that protruding labia are the anatomical norm and small inner labia are the adaptation to beauty standards, it ignores the fact that many women have naturally small labia:\n\nFurthermore, these campaigns as well have been criticized for putting too much blame on the porn industry and the subjection to male desires. It is argued that even though this might be the case to a certain degree, other factors that boost these surgeries are basically ignored. There is no evidence that smaller labia are actually preferred, as much or more \"large labia\" porn exists than any labeled for small.\n\nNew View is a New York City based, grassroots network of feminists, social scientists and health care providers. In a self-description, New View \"is opposed to the growth of the unregulated and unmonitored genital cosmetic surgery industry that is medicalizing women's sexuality and creating new risks, norms and insecurities.\" The group initiated several events with the aim of empowering women and raising awareness for the topic under names such as the \"Vulvagraphics\" or \"Vulvanomics\". These include workshops to \"celebrate the role of art in activism and to kick off a campus-based movement to celebrate genital diversity\", \"flash activism\" in front of surgeon's offices, conferences (\"Framing the Vulva\") and street demonstrations.\n\nCourageous Cunts is a feminist website, founded in 2012, that is focused on issues of body empowerment and genital self-awareness. Its primary concern is the critical reception of women's health issues, sexualized body images and the sexual objectification of female bodies. Courageous Cunts considers itself to be part of the so-called labia pride movement, with the aim of raising awareness for critical issues around labiaplasty and empowering women to overcome body shame. The site ran a campaign during which women could publicly post photographs of their vulva to promote a natural genital image and protest against \"porn aesthetics\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3238386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3238386", "title": "Landscape planning", "text": "Landscape planning\n\nLandscape planning is a branch of landscape architecture. According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing land uses while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and natural resources. Park systems and greenways of the type designed by Frederick Law Olmsted are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects.\n\nLandscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.\n\nIn India, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the Vedas and to the Vaastu Shastras. These ancient texts set forth principles for planning settlements, temples and other structures in relation to the natural landscape. Relationships with mountains (the home of the gods) and with rivers (regarded as goddesses) were of particular importance. A square form represented the earth and a circular form represented heaven. A mandala explained the relationship between heaven and earth. Square plans, for both secular and religious structures, were set out with their sides facing north, south, east and west. The earliest surviving stone temple set out in this way is Sanchi.\n\nIn China, landscape planning originated with Feng Shui, which is translated into English as 'wind and water' and is used to describe a set of general principles for the planning of development in relation to the natural landscape. The aim was to find the most auspicious environment possible, one sited in harmony with natural phenomena and the physical and psychological needs of man.\n\nIn Europe, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the work of Vitruvius. In discussing the planning of towns, he wrote about site planning with regard to microclimate, about the planning of streets and about the role of metaphor in design. Vitruvius' theories were revived during the renaissance and came to influence the planning of towns throughout Europe and the Americas. Alberti wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space. In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the Place des Vosges. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space (public parks within towns). Frederick Law Olmsted gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a park systems in Boston - the famous Emerald Necklace. Patrick Abercrombie took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London.\n\nIn the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with urban planners. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national land use planning system. Frederick Law Olmsted and Ian McHarg are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of GIS and to the foundation of ESRI by Jack Dangermond.\n\nThe principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the National Environmental Policy Act was influenced by the work of Ian McHarg on Environmental impact assessment. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the European Landscape Convention has wide-ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible.\n\nLandscape planners are concerned with the 'health' of the landscape, just as doctors are concerned with bodily health. This analogy can be taken further. Medical doctors advise both on the health of individuals and on matters of public health. When individuals take actions injurious to their own health this is regarded as a private matter. But if they take actions injurious to public health, these actions are properly regulated by law. The collective landscape is a public good which should be protected and enhanced by legislation and public administration. If, for example, mineral extraction has a damaging impact on the landscape, this is a proper field for intervention. Negative impacts on the landscape could include visual impacts, ecological impacts, hydrological impacts and recreational impacts. As well as protecting existing public goods, societies are responsible for the creation of new public goods. This can be done by positive landscape planning. There are, for example, many former mineral workings (e.g. the Norfolk Broads) which have become important public goods. Medical doctors are trained in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry etc. before becoming practitioners. Landscape doctors are trained in geomorphology, hydrology, ecology etc. before becoming practitioners in design and planning. When qualified, they can specialize in areas of landscape planning:\n\n\nIn each case, the aim is to take a specialist land use and make recommendations for what can be done to enhance its implact on the stock of environmental goods.\n\nThe conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are:\n\n\nLandscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that \"planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape\".

{"id": "2112546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112546", "title": "Leaderless resistance", "text": "Leaderless resistance\n\nLeaderless resistance, or phantom cell structure, is a social resistance strategy in which small, independent groups (covert cells), or individuals (a solo cell is called a \"Lone Wolf\"), challenge an established institution such as a law, economic system, social order, or government. Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from non-violent protest and civil disobedience to vandalism, terrorism, and other violent activity.\n\nLeaderless cells lack vertical command links and so operate without hierarchical command, but they have a common goal that links them to the social movement from which their ideology was learned.\n\nLeaderless resistance is simple and difficult to stamp out. It has been employed by a wide range of movements, including animal-liberation, radical environmentalist, anti-abortion, military invasion resistance, colonialism resistance, terrorist, and hate groups.\n\nA covert cell may be a lone individual or a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells that are acting toward shared goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no information about who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.\n\nLeaderless movements may have a symbolic figurehead. This can be a public figure, a multiple-use name, or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. Media, in this case, often create a positive feedback loop: by publishing declarations of a movement’s role model, this instills motivation, ideas, and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who in turn lend further authority to the figurehead. While this may loosely resemble a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no formal contact between the two levels of organization.\n\nAs a result, leaderless resistance cells are resistant to informants and traitors. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than it is with movements that adopt more conventional hierarchies.\n\nGiven of leaderless resistance, and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of a power imbalance, it has much in common with guerrilla warfare. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent insurgency or guerrilla movement, as with the Yugoslav partisans of World War II.\n\nLeaderless resistance often involves resistance by violent means, but it is not limited to them. Non-violent groups can use the same structure to author, print, and distribute samizdat literature, to create self-propagating boycotts against political opponents via the internet, to maintain an alternative electronic currency outside of the reach of taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, and so forth.\n\nThe concept of leaderless resistance was developed by Col. Ulius Louis Amoss, a former U.S. intelligence officer, in the early 1960s. An anti-communist, Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a way to prevent the penetration and destruction of CIA-supported resistance cells in Eastern European countries under Soviet control.\n\nThe concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government Ku Klux Klan member Louis Beam in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for white nationalists to continue the struggle against the U.S. government, despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources.\n\nBeam argued that conventional hierarchical pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the chain of command. A less dangerous approach would be to convince like-minded individuals to form independent cells without close communication between each other but generally operating in the same direction.\n\nThe first recorded direct action for animal liberation which progressed (after a considerable delay) into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the original \"Band of Mercy\" in 1824 whose goal was to thwart fox hunters. Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the Hunt Saboteurs Association (HSA) in 1964. Within a year, a leaderless model of hunt-sabotage groups was formed across the country.\n\nA new Band of Mercy was then formed in 1972. It used direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. Ronnie Lee and others changed the name of the movement to the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) in 1976 and adopted a leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation.\n\nEarth First! and the environmental movement in the 1980s also adopted the leaderless resistance model. An animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with the name Animal Rights Militia (ARM) in 1982. Letter bombs were sent to the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Two years later the name Hunt Retribution Squad (HRS) was also used.\n\nThe Earth Liberation Front (ELF) formed in 1992, breaking from Earth First! when that organization decided to focus on public direct action, instead of the ecotage that the ELF participated in. A violent group called the Justice Department was established in 1993, and in 1994 to hunters such as Prince Charles and to animal researchers.\n\nIn 1999 the leaderless resistance strategy was employed by animal liberation organisations like Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), which was formed from the Consort beagles campaign and Save the Hill Grove Cats to close down Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS). Despite claiming successes leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts. The Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade (RCALB) appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to Chiron Corporation and used incendiary devices against other targets.\n\nWithin a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged. At the same time, SPEAK Campaigns and the more radical ALF militants, Oxford Arson Squad began their campaigns towards the same goal: to end Oxford University's animal research.\n\nIn April 2009, the Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences (MFAH) became active. With the ALF, they began targeting HLS customer and financial Directors, as well as company property. Since then, groups have reported over a dozen actions in Europe, including painting homes, burning cars, and grave desecration. Militants, however, oppose , instead believing in any necessary action to prevent suffering at HLS's laboratories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The Islamist organization Al-Qaeda uses a typical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.\n\nGiven the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. When there is bidirectional communication with external leadership, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the London Underground on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for Islamic fundamentalism but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks, by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.\n\nThe concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States, as a proposed response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. , however, found in his research that for the most part the far right seldom used this tactic. Timothy McVeigh is one example in the United States. McVeigh worked in a small cell which based its attack on motivations widespread among far-right anti-government groups and the militia movement.\n\nLeaderless resistance has been advocated by White Supremacist groups such as White Aryan Resistance and the British neo-Nazi Combat 18. The modern Ku Klux Klan is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model. Troy Southgate also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the National Revolutionary Faction and a pioneer of National-Anarchism.\n\nStormfront, Aryan Nations, and Hammerskin Nation link to Beam's \"Leaderless Resistance\". These groups promote lone wolf actions. Stormfront, while regretting the loss of life, explains how Benjamin Nathaniel Smith's 1998 killing spree was compelled by circumstances. The World Church of the Creator gives a mixed message, calling Smith \"a selfless man who gave his life in the resistance to Jewish/mud tyranny,\" but noting \"the Church does not condone his acts.\"\n\nLeaderless resistance emerged in the environmental movement in 1976 when John Hanna and others as the Environmental Life Force (ELF) (also known now as the \"original ELF\") used explosive and incendiary devices. The group conducted armed actions in northern California and Oregon, later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the Salinas, California airport on May Day, 1977. A decade and a half later this form of guerrilla warfare resurfaced using the same acronym.\nIn 1980 Earth First! was founded by Dave Foreman and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the Edward Abbey novel \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\", Earth First! made use of such techniques as treesitting and treespiking to stop logging companies, as well as other activities targeted towards mining, road construction, suburban development, and energy companies.\n\nThe organization was committed to nonviolent ecotage techniques from the group's inception. Others split from the movement in the 1990s, including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) in 1992, which named itself after the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) which had formed in the 1970s. Three years later in Canada, inspired by the ELF in Europe, the first \"Earth Liberation\" direct action occurred, but this time as the Earth Liberation Army (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and monkeywrenching as a tool.\n\nA series of actions earned ELF the label of eco-terrorists, including the burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado in 1998, and the burning of an SUV dealership in Oregon in 1999. In the same year the ELA made headlines by setting fire to the Vail Resorts in Washington, D.C., causing $12 million in damages. The defendants in that case were later charged in the FBI's \"Operation Backfire\" with other crimes; this was later named by environmentalists as the Green Scare, alluding to the Red Scare periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks several laws were passed increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and the U.S. Congress held hearings on the activity of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action, and both groups forbid harming human or non-human life. It was announced in 2003 that \"eco-terrorist\" attacks, known as \"ecotage\", had increased from the ELF, ELA, and the \"Environmental Rangers\", another name used by activists when engaging in similar activity.\n\nIn 2005 the FBI announced that the ELF was America's greatest domestic terrorist threat, responsible for over 1,200 \"criminal incidents\" amounting to tens of millions of dollars in damage to property. The United States Department of Homeland Security confirmed this with regards to both the ALF and ELF.\n\n\nAnti-abortion militants The Army of God use leaderless resistance as their organizing principle. As of 2009, The Army of God's webpage hosts a reprint of an article entitled \"Leaderless Resistance\" from a publication called \"The Seditionist.\"\n\nLeaderless resistance social networks are potentially vulnerable to social network analysis and its derivative, link analysis. Link analysis of social networks is the fundamental reason for the ongoing legislative push in the U.S. and the European Union for mandatory retention of telecommunication traffic data and for limiting access to anonymous prepaid cellphones, as the stored data contain important network analysis clues.\nNetwork analysis was successfully used by French Colonel Yves Godard to break the Algerian resistance between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease their bombing campaigns. The Algerian conflict may be better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see \"Modern Warfare\" by Col. Roger Trinquier), and this illustrates the weakness of cell-structured insurgents when compared to leaderless ones. were obtained by the use of informants and torture and were used to obtain the identities of important individuals in the resistance; these individuals were then assassinated, which disrupted the Algerian resistance networks. The more irreplaceable the individual is in the adversary's network, the greater the damage is done to the network by removing them.\n\nTraditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, supported more by ideologies than organizations, generally lack such traces. The effects of their operations, as reported by the mass media, act as a sort of messaging and recruitment advertising.\n\nThe internet provides counterinsurgents with further challenges. Individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even when it is legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in a reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a web crawler.\n\nDespite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable. If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of publicity, which serves as the recruiting, motivation, and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. On the other hand, if the actions are too successful, support groups and other social structures will form that are vulnerable to network analysis.\n\n\n\n"}

The agency was created in 2002.\n\nThe mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing \"the phenomenon of movements with a cultic character whose actions affront the rights of man and fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations\".\n\nMIVILUDES provides information related to \"cultic deviances\" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.\n\nThe French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (\"Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes\"; English: \"Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults\"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the \"Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes\" established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. \n\nIn February 1998, MILS, headed by Alain Vivien, released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization (he had served as President of the Centre Roger Ikor from 1997 to 1998), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, as well as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a US government agency. (See also About-Picard law#Reactions). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home. Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.\n\nMIVILUDES was created by a presidential decree on 28 November 2002. Jean-Louis Langlais, a senior civil-servant at the Ministry of the Interior, served as its president from 2002 to 2005.\nAnnouncing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of religious freedom. The decree establishing MIVILUDES\nreferred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. \n\nIn an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against \"sects\", but against \"sectarian deviances\". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a \"sect\" and, therefore \"the law cannot define sectarian deviances\". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to \"defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence\".\n\nA 2004 report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.\n\nJean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005, followed by Georges Fenech in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47023322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47023322", "title": "Mainz Diocesan Feud", "text": "Mainz Diocesan Feud\n\nThe Mainz Diocesan Feud (), also known as the Baden-Palatine War (\"Badisch-Pfälzischer Krieg\"), took place in 1461/1462 and was a warlike conflict for the throne of the Electorate of Mainz.\n\nIn 1459 the \"Domkustos\", Diether of Isenburg, was elected, with a small majority, beating Adolph of Nassau to become the new Archbishop of Mainz. Diether immediately had to join the so-called anti-Palatinate alliance which had fallen into a dispute in 1458 with the Count Palatine, Frederick I. Diether forged an alliance and marched to war against the Count Palatine, but lost the decisive battle of Pfeddersheim in July 1460.\n\nBecause Diether was able to achieve his papal confirmation only with some difficulty and by paying a large amount of money (\"Servitiengeld\", 20,000 guilders), he opposed the political, legal, and financial demands of both Emperor and Pope. Pope Pius II thus sought his replacement by Adolph of Nassau who had been defeated in the 1459 election. He banished Diether on 21 August 1461 and declared him deposed, citing Diether's oppositional attitude towards the Church and Emperor Frederick III, Diether's reform efforts, and his demands for abolition of papal annates. Adolph of Nassau was appointed by the Pope as the new Archbishop of Mainz and enthroned on 1 October 1461. The city of Mainz, however, continued to support Diether, who refused to vacate the archbishop's throne.\n\nAdolph allied himself with the Archbishop of Trier, John II of Baden; the Bishop of Metz, George of Baden; the Bishop of Speyer, John II Nix of Hoheneck; and Count Ulrich V of Württemberg. Margrave Charles I of Baden at first tried to mediate between the warring factions, then took the side of his brother, Bishop George of Metz, who was in Adolph's camp, thus precipitating the Baden-Palatinate war, an attempt to seize the disputed bishopric by force.\n\nOn Diether's side were the city council of Mainz, his brother Louis, and Prince-Elector Frederick I of the Palatinate, originally an enemy of Diether's. For his assistance, Frederick was given the towns of Lorsch, Heppenheim and Bensheim.\n\nInitially the Baden troops devastated the Palatine estates left of the Rhine, then advanced alongside those from Speyer and Württemberg up the eastern side of the Rhine and rampaged through the Palatine lands there too.\n\nIn summer 1462, those on the side of the alliance under Adolph of Nassau believed rumours that Count Palatine Frederick and his troops were holding on in Bavaria in order to stand by the Duke in a feud against the Margrave of Ansbach. Under the assumption that the Palatinate was therefore undefended, Baden and Württemberg troops marched from Bretten with 8,000 men and invaded the state. They advanced, burning and plundering, from Speyer over the Rhine to Seckenheim. Because Frederick I had, however, not stayed in Bavaria, Adolph's forces were surprised and heavily defeated in the forest near Seckenheim by Frederick I and the counts of Leiningen and Katzenelnbogen, because the mounted vanguard of the alliance had felt so unthreatened that they had strayed too far ahead of their foot soldiers. Margrave Charles I and his brother, Bishop George of Metz, were wounded and taken prisoner. With the capture of Count Ulrich V of Württemberg soon afterwards by Hans von Gemmingen this phase of the war came to an end. His victory in the Battle of Seckenheim earned Frederick the nickname \"the Victorious\" (\"der Siegreiche\"). The name of the settlement of Friedrichsfeld (\"Frederick's field\"), built on the site and now a district of Mannheim, commemorates that event.\n\nFrederick I had the prisoners taken to his castle at Heidelberg and put in chains until the ransoms demanded by him were paid. Margrave Charles had to pay 25,000 guilders, hand over Sponheim as a pledge and agree Pforzheim as a fief of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The Bishop of Metz had to pay 45,000 guilders for his release. Most importantly for Frederick, though, the victory had sealed the long-term security of his position as prince-elector.\n\nBut the diocesan feud did not end there. Further battles cost many lives and resulted in the devastation of all the settlements, and the town of Mainz itself suffered severe damage. In the night of 28 October 1462, as a result of the betrayal of some of Mainz's citizens, Adolph of Nassau broke into the town through the gate called the \"Gautor\" with 500 men and, after 12 hours of street fighting took possession of the town. 400 men lost their lives and Adolph's people plundered and sacked parts of the town including the former Dominican monastery. As a punishment for its support of Diether, Adolph removed the town's privileges of freedom and thus its status as a free town; the town came under the rule of a vicedominus appointed by the Archbishop. The following day the citizens were summoned to the \"Dietmarkt\" market place. All 800 citizens who appeared were driven out of the town; about 400 of them were released again some time later and allowed to remain in Mainz.\n\nThe diocesan feud itself ended only after several attempts at mediation in October 1463. Diether of Isenburg stood down and recognised Adolph as his successor in the Treaty of Zeilsheim. He himself was paid off with a considerable sum of money and a small principality, created from the Mainz estate, consisting of the towns of Höchst, Steinheim and Dieburg.\n\nThe alliances of both contenders for the archbishop's throne had been bought at considerable cost to both their personal and the archiepiscopal estate. A number of castles and towns were transferred to the Palatinate, Hesse and, briefly, even Saxony. The settlement of that debt remained a dominant issue in the Archbishopric in the coming years.\n\nAfter the death of Adolph in 1475, Diether of Isenburg was once more elected as archbishop by the Mainz cathedral chapter and confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Diether reigned without further conflict until his death in 1482.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "523804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523804", "title": "Mashup (music)", "text": "Mashup (music)\n\nA mashup (also mesh, mash up, mash-up, blend, bootleg and bastard pop/rock) is a creative work, usually in a form of a song, created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another. To the extent that such works are \"transformative\" of original content, in the United States they may find protection from copyright claims under the \"fair use\" doctrine of copyright law.\n\nMashups are known by a number of different names:\nIn addition, more traditional terms such as \"edits\" or (unauthorized) \"remixes\" are favored by many \"bootleggers\" (also known as 'leggers).\n\nThe practice of assembling new songs from purloined elements of other tracks stretches back to the beginnings of recorded music. If one extends the definition beyond the realm of pop, precursors can be found in musique concrète, as well as the classical practice of (re-)arranging traditional folk material and the jazz tradition of reinterpreting standards. In addition, many elements of mashup culture have antecedents in hip hop and the DIY ethic of punk as well as overlap with the free culture movement.\n\nIn 1956, Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman released what they called a \"break-in\" song, (i.e. material from one song would \"break-in\" to another) called \"The Flying Saucer\". The track, a reinterpretation of Orson Welles' celebrated \"War of the Worlds\" mock-emergency broadcast interspliced with musical snippets comically dramatizing the portentous patter of the announcer, spawned a raft of imitations. Goodman had several other similar hits in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThere have been a number of novelty records and one-off hits that have included uncleared samples. The song \"Your Woman\" by White Town features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song \"My Woman\" by the Lew Stone Band taken from the soundtrack of the Dennis Potter series \"Pennies From Heaven\". Other notable one-off bootlegs include DNA's dance remix of Suzanne Vega's \"Tom's Diner\"(1990) and \"You Got The Love\" by The Source featuring Candi Staton (1991). Vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her (a cappella) song, and eventually issued an entire CD of \"Tom's Diner\" mixes, one notable example being \"Jeannie's Diner\", in which a resung verse based on Vega's composition describes the premise of the situation comedy \"I Dream of Jeannie\". \"Tom's Diner\" is likely to be the first song that was \"mash mixed\" as we now know the process.\n\nOne series was John Morales' (later one half of M and M productions) \"Deadly Medleys\", in which he mixed-up disco hits of the moment to form beat-consistent collages. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dutch producer Jaap Eggermont produced the Stars on 45 series of records. These records attempted to cram as many hits as possible into the space of a three and a half-minute pop song, and are more accurately described as medleys. A similar series by Mirage in the late 1980s took this further by densely layering the songs on its \"Jack Mix\" records so that these were very close to later mashups.\n\nSinger-producer Jonathan King anticipated the mashup genre with several novelty singles. In 1987, King accused the Pet Shop Boys of plagiarizing the melody of Cat Stevens' \"Wild World\" for their song \"It's A Sin\". To prove the point, King recorded a version of \"Wild World\" with an arrangement virtually identical to that of \"It's A Sin\". King performed an analogous stunt with a version of \"He's So Fine\" by The Chiffons arranged in the style of George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\", making a cheeky reference to the plagiarism suit over the similarities between the two songs.\n\nLittle Roger and the Goosebumps released their single \"Gilligan's Island (Stairway)\", later renamed \"Stairway to Gilligan's Island\" in May 1978 on their own Splash Records label. The song combines the lyrics to the theme song of the television show \"Gilligan's Island\" with the music of \"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin. Later in 1978, Damaskas and Barnes & Barnes were inspired by Little Roger and the Goosebumps to record \"A Day in the Life of Green Acres,\" a song that combined the music of The Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show \"Green Acres\".\n\nIn the 1970s, Frank Zappa developed a technique he called \"xenochrony\" in which a guitar solo was extracted from its original context and placed into a completely different song. His recording engineer referred to this as \"the Ampex guitar\". In his rock opera \"Joe's Garage\" (1979), for example, Zappa's xenochrony can be heard on every track apart from \"Watermelon in Easter Hay\".\n\n\"Rubber Shirt\" from the album \"Sheik Yerbouti\" consists of a bass track and a drum track taken from two different live performances melded together in the studio.\n\nThe 1990 John Zorn album \"Naked City\" features a version of Ornette Coleman's \"Lonely Woman\" set over the bassline of Roy Orbison's \"Pretty Woman\".\n\nJohn Oswald has been devising illegitimate compositions since the late 1960s. His 1975 track \"Power\" married frenetic Led Zeppelin guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a Southern American evangelist at the same time that hip hop was discovering the potency of the same (and related) kinds of ingredients. Similarly, his 1990 track \"Vane\", which pitted two different versions of the song \"You're So Vain\" (the Carly Simon original and a cover by Faster Pussycat) against each other, was a blueprint for the contemporary mashup subgenre, glitch pop. Oswald coined the term \"plunderphonics\" to describe his illegitimate craft. In 1993, he released \"Plexure\". Arguably his most ambitious composition to date, it attempted to microsample the history of CD music up to that point (1982–1992) in a 20-minute collage of bewildering complexity. The ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the British bootlegger Osymyso, whose \"Intro-Inspection\" captured the pop-junkie feel of \"Plexure\". Osymyso, who at the time was unaware of Oswald's work, used the same structure of an accelerando (arranging his source material in order from the slowest tempo to the fastest) to link a few bars each of 100 songs, creating a simpler sound than the thousands of overlapping and morphing pop \"electroquotations\" in \"Plexure\".\n\nIn 1982, Italo disco composer and producer Stefano Pulga, under the name Pink Project, had a substantial hit with \"Disco Project\", a completely re-recorded version of The Alan Parsons Project's instrumental track \"Mammagamma\" (from the album \"Eye in the Sky\"), using \"Sirius\" (from the same album) as an intro, and featuring the schoolchildren's choir vocals (also entirely re-recorded by female session vocalists) from Pink Floyd's \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" on top of the Parsons track. Technically more similar to a medley of cover versions (as it did not include any elements directly taken from the original records) than to a mashup, the record was nevertheless identified with the nascent genre by Italian radio DJs.\n\nThough Negativland are seldom acknowledged as musical antecedents of mashups, lacking perhaps the sense of fun many contemporary practitioners seek in their craft, their struggle against various forms of \"censorship\" (in their terms) and legal coercion (for instance, their single \"U2\" was one of the first pieces of music to be withdrawn for its use of unauthorised samples) has made them poster children for some mashup commentators who approach the issue from a more critical perspective, and with an eye to the complicated cultural issues raised by both accidental and deliberate plundering within music and culture generally.\n\nAlso known as \"Public Works\", The Tape-beatles have used collage techniques to create works of materials appropriated from various sources.\n\nWorking under the name Steinski, New York copywriter DJ Steve Stein began (in conjunction with engineer and fellow studio boffin Doug \"Double Dee\" DiFranco) the next chapter in the evolution of illicit pop by producing a trio of underground 12\" singles (entitled \"The Payoff Mix\" (1983), \"Lesson 2 (The James Brown Mix)\" (1984) and \"Lesson 3 (History of Hiphop)\" (1985)) which exerted a powerful influence on an entire generation of \"samplists\".\n\nIn 1994, the experimental band Evolution Control Committee released the first modern mashup tracks on their hand-made cassette album, \"Gunderphonic\". These \"Whipped Cream Mixes\" combined a pair of Public Enemy a cappellas with instrumentals by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. First released on home-made cassettes in early 1992, it was later pressed on 7\" vinyl, and distributed by Eerie Materials in the mid-1990s, the tracks gained some degree of notoriety on college radio stations in the United States.\n\nThe name Pop Will Eat Itself was taken from an \"NME\" feature on the band Jamie Wednesday, written by David Quantick, which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously, the perfect pop song could be written by [combining] the best of those ideas into one track. Hence, Pop Will Eat Itself.\n\nThe movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of the \"2 Many DJs\" album, \"As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2\", by Soulwax's Dewaele brothers, which combined 45 different tracks; the same year a remix of Christina Aguilera's \"Genie in a Bottle\" was also released by Freelance Hellraiser, which coupled the pop star with the raucous guitars of \"Hard To Explain\" by New York's The Strokes in an infectious concoction entitled \"A Stroke of Genie-us\".\n\nAs a result of this, industry standard tools such as the digital audio workstation Cubase and the sound editors Wavelab, Soundforge and Cool Edit Pro quickly became ubiquitous. Moreover, new tools such as Ableton Live and Sonic Foundry's (now Magix's) ACID Pro were tweaked to accommodate the needs of this new \"scene\". Most notably, such features as beat-mapping (a technique that simplifies the synchronization of samples of different tempos) and online previewing (allowing the composer to audition a sample, playing at the right pitch and tempo, alongside their existing composition) made it easy for many people with musical ability but little professional studio experience to knock together new combinations in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools, such as the magnetic tape John Oswald (and even Coldcut) slaved over in their early days.\n\nMark Vidler, known as Go Home Productions, summarized it by saying the benefits of such technology of AcidPro: \"You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom, and you don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself.\"\n\nAround 2001–2002, the blog Boomselection was launched. It publicised various challenges which resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of new bootlegs being uploaded to sites around the world. While the scene began as a primarily British phenomenon, the U.S., France and Germany are currently the hotbeds of the modern mashup movement. However, there are notable bootleggers to be found in practically every corner of the globe – wherever an Internet connection and a record collection can be found – including Australia, Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden.\n\nThe Get Your Bootleg on site (affectionately abbreviated to GYBO) became an important launchpad for new mashup tunes, and was the home of a lively community of bootleggers who offered critiques of new songs, tips for newbies, pointers on where to find a cappellas, legal advice, publicity for mashup events and general discussion of issues surrounding the mashup phenomenon.\n\nThe name \"Get Your Bootleg On\" comes from the Missy Elliott track \"Get Ur Freak On\", which alongside Eminem’s \"Without Me\" remains perhaps the most bootlegged, manipulated, remixed and reinterpreted song from the heyday of the genre. Other popular, frequently bootlegged artists include Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Madonna and Beyoncé.\n\nIn early 2005, Boomselection retired itself after a long period of inactivity. The year also marked a series of cease-and-desist orders brought against a number of bootleg sites, and in early 2006 GYBO received its first such notice. To survive, the site prohibited the posting of direct links to copyrighted material within the forums, but allowed users to post links to their own sites containing such material, the defence being that now GYBO was no more in violation of copyright law than Google. For the most part, the community has rallied around the site, and continues to support it in its new form.\n\nThe void left by Boomselection's demise was rapidly replaced by Mashuptown which was started in early 2005 and is currently the biggest blog source of mashups on the Internet. The site has recently become the official supplier of mashups to Adam Curry's Daily Source Code podcast.\n\nAlso in 2005, Bootie, the biggest bootleg mashup party in the world, began its monthly Bootie Top 10 where it posts for free download its ten best mashups, as selected by Bootie creators and DJs A Plus D. Launched in San Francisco in 2003, Bootie was the first club night in the United States dedicated solely to the burgeoning art form of the bootleg mashup, and now hosts monthly parties in several cities around the globe, including Los Angeles, Paris, Boston, Munich, and New York City. The party's slogan, \"Music for the A.D.D. Generation\" also inspired the creation of \"A.D.D\", Israel's first mash-up dedicated party.\n\nLegal mashups are hard to find, but in some relatively small music markets, legal mashups have been released. Some say that this is because publishers have understood the potential of clearing the rights of major international artist to be combined with local repertoires, to create a wider consumption for both artists on a given track.\n\nIn Israel, for example, a group called Bonna Music remixed the Depeche Mode song \"Enjoy the Silence\" with Balagan's \"Sheket\" (; \"Silence\"). The mashup was approved by Martin Gore and released officially a month before Depeche Mode's new album \"Playing the Angel\" in 2005. It was a major hit locally and when Depeche Mode's first single was released they were more welcome in a market where the local repertoire is dominant.\n\n\"Good Copy Bad Copy\" is a 2007 documentary about the current state of copyright and culture. It has a heavy focus on the mashup community, containing interviews with Girl Talk and Danger Mouse that reveal an emerging understanding of digital works and the obstacle to their authoring copyright presents.\n\nMash-ups have been featured on many episodes of the popular American TV series \"Glee\". They first appeared in the episode \"Vitamin D\", which featured mashing up Bon Jovi's \"It's My Life\" with Usher's \"Confessions Part II\" and Beyoncé Knowles's \"Halo\" with \"Walking on Sunshine\" by Katrina and the Waves.\n\nThe 2009 video game \"DJ Hero\" brought mash-ups together with gameplay elements from the \"Guitar Hero\" series using many of the same songs that are routinely cut-up in the online remixing scene. Notably, the tracks which use musical ideas from \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" credit the sample source Andrew Oldham Orchestra rather than The Verve, even though the Verve's use of the sample and the surrounding legal controversy is what popularized the frequent use of the sample in mash-ups.\n\n\"RIP!: A Remix Manifesto\" is an open source documentary created by Brett Gaylor and Greg Gillis (Girl Talk). The film consists of a remix of clips submitted by numerous contributors to the Open Source Cinema project. It focuses in particular on the legal \"grey area\" of remixing existing copyrighted works.\n\n\n\nThe original manifestation of mashups in the 2000s was putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track, in order to make a \"third song\". Following \"A Stroke of Genie-us\" in 2001, the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise.\n\nAnother notable \"versus\" song is \"Zombi – Zombie Nation\" which combined Zombie Nation's \"Kernkraft 400\" with Goblin's \"Zombi\" theme and was featured on the official soundtrack of the film \"Shaun of the Dead\".\n\nIn addition, Go Home Productions, Party Ben and DJ BC, amongst many others, have produced a number of critically acclaimed songs in this vein, and in some instances have secured record deals on the back of these exercises, which arguably serve as \"demo MP3s\" of their musical and production skills.\n\nAnother example of a legitimate release on the back of an unofficial one can be seen in Illicit's \"Sneaky Armada\", which combined Groove Armada's \"I See You Baby\" with Teddy Pendergrass's \"You Can't Hide From Yourself\". This was subsequently re-played, re-vocalised and re-released on Azuli's Yola label as \"Cheeky Armada\" in September 2001 when it reached number 72 in the UK Singles Chart. Illicit also released numerous other unofficial \"versus\" songs during the same period.\n\nHowever, not all mash-ups are as simple as A vs B. In some cases, DJs will mash 3, 4, 5, and even 6 songs to form one complete track. Mixing more than two tracks together can be a daunting task, and it requires a great deal of skill. Notably, DJ Earworm has combined the yearly top 25 songs according to \"Billboard\" into a single mashup since 2007, which has spawned similar creations from popular DJs such as Robin Skouteris or Daniel Kim. These mashups are typically uploaded to YouTube and attract a lot of attention in the pop culture world.\n\nGirl Talk is known for his style of multi-track mashing; most of his mashups contain samples from 20–30 different tracks. Girl Talk is famous for his style of \"cutting\" through different songs and often building to the climax of a song, upon which the song settles into a groove before cutting away again.\n\nMixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternative version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish. It can mix two different versions of a song, such as a ballad and original version, or a cover version of the song. Some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes, which is mixing multiple languages into one song. A slightly less popular style of this is mashing two different remixes or the original and a specific remix of a song together. Version vs Version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song.\n\nMusic collages which refer to avant-garde music practice and Musique Concrète. These are not intended for the dance floor and are made using all types of music and sound as valid sound sources to be played simultaneously and often manipulated. Beat matching and stylistic or aesthetic similarities are not an important factor in these mash ups. Chaos, dissonance and harmony are all possible results.\n\nAn early example of this can be heard on John Cage's multi-radio composition \"Imaginary Landscapes No. 4\" (1951) for 12 radios, 24 performers and a conductor. Perhaps the most famous Abstract Mash Up is The Beatles \"Revolution 9\" featuring on their White Album from 1968 which includes samples of conversations, classical music and edited and manipulated samples played simultaneously. Other examples of the psychedelic nature of these mash ups can be heard on \"Heart Beat, Pig Meat\" by Pink Floyd from the soundtrack to the film \"Zabriskie Point\"; \"The Beatles Play the Residents and the Residents Play the Beatles\" and the album \"The Third Reich 'n Roll\" by The Residents and early turntable work by Christian Marclay.\n\nA current (2013) example of Abstract Mash Ups can be heard on radio shows by Joel Cahen ( 'Spax') on Resonance fm in London. The series of shows which began in 2005, feature live abstract mash ups using MP3s, turntables, CDs, DVDs and field recordings as simultaneously played sound sources. The third season of this series, \"Soundsoup\", March 2008–April 2010, veered the style towards a more narrative based one.\n\nGlitch pop is a subgenre of the mashup scene which marries the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) wizardry associated with Kid 606 and Tigerbeat6 records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop. Sometimes this is done in a spirit of \"homage\"; sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification; often it is both at the same time.\n\nAn example of the \"double science\" at play in glitch pop is Skkatter's \"Dirty Pop\", which takes a song that is already an epic of carefully constructed digital micro-malfunctions (BT's deconstruction of *NSYNC's \"Pop\") and pushes it even further out to the margins of musical mayhem. Similarly, Australian bootlegger and glitch pop co-conspirator Dsico (real name Luke Collinson) has reworked a number of R&B tunes by such artists as The Neptunes and (again) *NSYNC in a spirit that is at once both satirical and steeped in fanboydom. In most cases these remixes render ostensibly mainstream songs \"avant garde\" and fresh, sometimes by working against the spirit of the original, but often by leveraging the sugar rush at the heart of much of the best contemporary pop, and adding sonic CGI to its emotional armoury.\n\nSiX DwArF is a non-commercial mashup artist from Scotland in the UK with a twist. He creates cross-genre mashup tunes but also invents mashup promo videos to go with them which feature on Mash TV, hosted on Veetle and on various video hosting sites. SiX DwArF also creates homemade promos to champion songs that do not already have one in which he feels deserves it, receiving praise from various artists. His modus operandi is: \"There's no campaigns, zero commercial gain, no vested interests. Nothing is sacred. Don't do genre... it's stereotype by another name.\"\n\nTechnically, all mashups are remixes. But while most are made up entirely of plundered material, some bootleggers have fused old a cappella tracks with completely new compositions of their own device. An example of popular remix artists that primarily remixes single songs but also mashes songs are The White Panda. The Chicago-based duo has emerged as one of the biggest upcoming DJs.\n\nAnother popular example with fans of Japanese pop is \"Evil Morning\", an album which combines vocal tracks from Morning Musume and their associated artists with new instrumental tracks that rearrange or replay the original music in the style of hard rock or heavy metal.\n\nDJ Danger Mouse's critically acclaimed remix project \"The Grey Album\" effectively launched a new pop subgenre. While The Beatles had made appearances on several mash-up tracks prior to this album (for instance PPM's \"A Life in the Day\" and JPL's \"Let It Be Missy Elliott (Beatlesmix)\"), \"The Grey Album\" distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from The Beatles' \"White Album\" and vocals from Jay-Z's \"The Black Album\". The project received considerable attention following EMI's legal threats towards distributors of the album.\n\nAnother album is \"Jon Moskowitz Presents Blue Eyes Meets Bed-Stuy\", produced by DJ Cappel & Smitty (2005). This is a remix/mash-up album of The Notorious B.I.G. and Frank Sinatra. The project was very well received, with major online and print coverage. It was conceived and executive produced by Jon Moskowitz. DJ Cappel and Smitty took The Notorious B.I.G.'s a cappellas and remixed them with notable Frank Sinatra songs, by contributing Sinatra's solos, hooks and choruses.\n\nThe \"Best of Bootie\" mashup compilation series is compiled and produced each year by A Plus D, creators of the international mashup club Bootie. The compilations have been released in December every year since 2005, and are annual Internet sensations, with each album garnering over 5000GB+ of downloads.\n\nWhile there is some overlap between the terms \"cut up\" and \"mash up\", the former has increasingly come to refer to pieces that rely on the humour (or pathos) of reconstructed spoken word and video material. This may be due to the fact that the term \"cut up\" was used decades earlier by novelist and artist William S. Burroughs to refer to his literary cutups as well as his tape recorder experiments, which featured spliced vocal tracks in the same way that his written cut-ups literally cut up and rearranged various texts.\n\nThe best known cutups remix political speeches and rallies to satirical effect. Simon Hunt, under the pseudonym Pauline Pantsdown used the speeches of Pauline Hanson, an anti-immigration, controversial Australian politician to parodic effect in the songs I Don't Like It and Backdoor Man. Johan Söderberg's \"Endless Love\", in which George W. Bush and Tony Blair appear to serenade each other like lovebirds, Chris Morris' \"Bushwhacked\", a \"détournement\" of Bush's 2003 State of the Union Address, or \"Sarkoskanking\" by Polémix and La Voix Off, a cut-off of Nicolas Sarkozy's speeches.\n\nNotable cut up artists include Cassetteboy, Osymyso, rx, Cartel Communique and Evolution Control Committee.\n\nOne of the most well known artists in the mashup industry is Gregg Michael Gillis, otherwise known as Girl Talk. He studied engineering in college and then quit the industry in 2007 in order to focus solely on his music career. He is originally from Pittsburgh, PA and is one of many artists under the record label, Illegal Art, which specializes in music sampling. Other artists with Illegal Art include Junk Culture and People Like Us. Girl Talk has released five albums with Illegal Art: Secret Diary, Unstoppable, Night Ripper, Feed the Animals, and All Day. Girl Talk does not believe that they are violating any factor of the Fair Use Laws as the law does not specify for mashups and remixes and the length of the song that is used. Thus, Girl Talk feels that they should not have to pay the sustained artists a fee for the work they are using. However, others feel that Girl Talk is violating the Fair Use Law and should be penalized.\n\nWith the rise of electronic dance music in the mainstream media, Italian duo Djs from Mars became a notable act in mash-up making.\nMost well known for mixing opposite genres, on a 128BPM club beat, the duo has toured the world extensively and their mashups have been played by DJs such as David Guetta, Bob Sinclar, Martin Solveig, among others.\nWearing box-masks over their heads, the satirical duo has been mixing Lady Gaga with Metallica, Skrillex with Oasis and over 30 different songs into one with their \"Megashuffle MultiBootleg\". Djs from Mars' success was confirmed in March 2011, when the pair opened a show for Tiesto, in Atlantic City.\n\nJordan Roseman (a.k.a. DJ Earworm) gained popularity when he came out with his mashup \"United States of Pop\" in 2007. The mashup contains the top 25 songs of the year according to the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2007. He has since released one at the end of each year. Earworm has also released mashups he has done for Capital FM's Summertime Ball since 2010. In addition, Earworm was asked to create multiple mixes for the 2012 Summer Olympics to be played at various venues throughout London.\n\nMashd N Kutcher are an Australian live electronic act established in 2014. The duo found acclaim through the mashup releases ‘Mash Machine’, combining vocal rock and pop anthems with current electronic club music. Most well known for their mashup style ‘Collab’ videos, the duo amassed over 1 million followers on Facebook, and are known for their live mashup performances throughout North America and Europe, regularly supporting DJ acts such as Borgore, Tiesto and DJ Snake. In 2016 Mashd N Kutcher signed with Universal Music Group and have achieved multiple gold record status with their singles ‘Do It Now’ and ‘My Sunshine’.\n\nBob Cronin (a.k.a. dj BC) has been heard on radio stations from New York to Paris. He is known for founding both Mash Ave and Bootie Boston. dj BC is associated with the fictional band The Beastles which BC created in 2004. The band is a combination of music from The Beatles and the Beastie Boys. BC's band has released three albums, \"dj BC presents The Beastles\", \"Let It Beast\", and \"Ill Submarine\". Other notable works from BC are \"Glassbreaks\", in which the music of Philip Glass is combined with artists such as Lil Jon and Kanye West, and \"Wu Orleans\", a mashup of Wu-Tang Clan and the local music found in New Orleans, Louisiana for the first anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMax Tannone is a New York-based producer who has released multiple mashup albums. He is most well known for his first album entitled \"Jaydiohead\" released in 2009. The album combined the music of Jay-Z and Radiohead. Tannone has since released seven more albums, \"Doublecheck Your Head\", \"Mos Dub\", \"Dub Kweli\", \"Selene\", \"Ghostfunk\", \"Mic Check 1234!\", and \"Champagne Jerry - For Real, You Guys\".\n\nThe Kleptones is a one-man musical group led by English producer Eric Kleptone. Their first release was in 2003 with their album \"Yoshimi Battles the Hip-Hop Robots\". It was not until 2004 though that they received attention with their album \"A Night at the Hip-Hopera\". The album combined the music of Queen with various music selections from rap, movies, and other various sources. In 2005, Eric Kleptone was awarded the Webby Award for Artist of the Year by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.\n\nNY-based DJ Craigory Morgoone (a.k.a. DJ Cummerbund) received worldwide attention and critical acclaim after releasing his mashup \"The Sound of Smash Mouth\" which featured a variety of sad movie scenes to accompany the melancholy amalgamation of All Star by Smash Mouth and a cover of The Sound of Silence by American heavy metal band Disturbed. Since then, he continues to release mashups via YouTube and occasionally perform live DJ sets in the NY metro area.\n\nThe Legion of Doom is an electronic production team consisting of Chad Blinman and Trever Keith. The group is most known for their album \"Incorporated\" which featured a variety of A vs B style mashups. The album was originally leaked online due to multiple artists not wanting their music being used in mashups. The album has since been released through Illegal Art.\n\nThe Hood Internet is a Chicago duo consisting of Aaron Brink and Steve Reidell. The duo specializes in combining hip hop and indie rock music. They have released one studio album, \"FEAT\" released under the Decon record label. In 2009 at the BRIT Awards the musical group The Ting Tings performed a pairing of songs that The Hood Internet had released the year earlier. The pairing was The Ting Tings' \"Shut Up and Let Me Go\" and \"American Boy\" by Estelle.\n\nFrench DJ and producer Hugo Pierre Leclercq (a.k.a. Madeon) received acclaim when his YouTube video \"Pop Culture\", in which Leclercq performs a live mashup, went viral. He has since released three more mashups along with multiple remixes, singles, and production and songwriting credits. In addition, he has released two EPs, \"The City\" and \"Japan Only EP\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Albums by Neil Cicierega\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6305266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6305266", "title": "Master–slave dialectic", "text": "Master–slave dialectic\n\nThe master–slave dialectic is the common name for a famous passage of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\", though the original German phrase, \"Herrschaft und Knechtschaft\", is more properly translated as Lordship and Bondage. It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's philosophical system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers.\n\nThe passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, self-conscious beings. The essence of the dialectic is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a \"struggle to the death\" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.\n\n\"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage\" is the first of two titled subsections in the \"Self-Consciousness\" chapter of \"Phenomenology\". It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of \"Life\" and \"Desire\", among other things, and is followed by \"Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness\".\n\nHegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically sublates into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the \"Phenomenology\" may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an \"a priori\" for understanding the \"Science of Logic\", and as a part of the \"Science of Logic\", where Hegel discusses absolute knowledge.\n\nCrucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness. Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by Johann Gottlieb Fichte and its treatment marks a watershed in European philosophy.\n\nIn order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet. However, Hegel's idea of the development of self-consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a phenomenological construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself.\n\nThe abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion. It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see hominization) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom.\n\nThat the master–slave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an \"end to the antithesis of subject and object\". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, sublate one another until they are unified, and the \"story\" takes this process through its various \"moments\" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity.\n\nFirst, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror-like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will.\n\nAccording to Hegel,\n\nWhen initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized :'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.\n\nA struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails. Hegel refers to this failure as \"abstract negation\" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery. This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.\n\nTruth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self-certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.\n\nHowever, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master. As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own creativity, he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while\nthe master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the labour of his slave.\n\nOne interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self-consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.\n\nAs philosopher Robert Brandom explains:\n\"Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with—to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so easy to see just how the argument works.\"\n\nAlexandre Kojève's unique interpretation differs from this. For Kojève, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral citizen of the universal and homogenous state created by Napoleon.\n\nThe master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to Karl Marx's conception of class struggle as the motive force of social development..\n\nHegel's master–slave dialectic has been influential in the social sciences, philosophy, literary studies, critical theory, postcolonial studies and in psychoanalysis. Furthermore, Hegel's master–slave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on Martin Buber's relational schema in \"I and Thou\", Simone de Beauvoir's account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in \"The Second Sex\" and Frantz Fanon's description of the colonial relation in \"Black Skin, White Masks\". Susan Buck-Morss's article \"Hegel and Haiti\" argues that the Haitian revolution influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.\n\n"}

{"id": "21173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21173", "title": "Natural language", "text": "Natural language\n\nIn neuropsychology, linguistics, and the philosophy of language, a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or to study logic.\n\nThough the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or constructed languages (such as computer programming languages and international auxiliary languages) and to other communication systems in nature. Such examples include bees' waggle dance and whale song, to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of dialect and even syntax. \n\nAll language varieties of world languages are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published prescriptivism or language regulation than others. Thus nonstandard dialects can be viewed as a wild type in comparison with standard languages. But even an official language with a regulating academy, such as Standard French with the French Academy, is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of natural language processing), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a constructed language or controlled enough to be classified as a controlled natural language.\n\nControlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or irregular verbs). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is Simplified English, which was originally developed for aerospace industry maintenance manuals.\n\nConstructed international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Interlingua (even those that have native speakers) are not generally considered natural languages. Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by L.L. Zamenhof selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally \"standardized\" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of pidgin languages into creole languages (as explained by Steven Pinker in \"The Language Instinct\"), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages. More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a linguistic research body, but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention. Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural. Latino Sine Flexione, a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.\n\n\n"}

These procedures are used to mirror the natural areas of language use for children. Behavior analysts language training procedures run along a continuum from highly restrictive such as discrete trial training to very nonrestrictive conversationally-based strategies. Natural language falls in the middle of these procedures.\n\nNatural language training, sometimes referred to as milieu (person's social environment.) language training emerged from generalization research by Donald Baer. The focus on these procedures was to use concepts closer to the natural environment to reduce prompt dependency and promote generalization. The initial procedure was the incidental teaching procedure.\n\nThe natural language training approach is often contrasted with discrete trial approaches. In discrete trial program there is a clear trial window and only the first response is scored. If incorrect no reward is delivered and the trainer moves to the next trial. In the milieu language training program (natural language program), the trainer uses a least-to-most response strategy and waits for the correct response to be produced. Research exists showing that over 90% of the studies report good generalization for natural language training procedures.\n\nCurrently, these procedures are used to teach children with autism, language delays, and developmental disabilities. Drawing on a behavior analytic model of child development (see Behavior analysis of child development) the goal of these procedures is to remediate developmental deficits. Because of their focus on generalization, natural language programs are often recommended when discrete trial programs run into problems. These procedures are also recommended as part of building comprehensive programs for children with autism.\n\nNatural language training procedures use a least to most prompt strategy. This strategy starts with designing/engineering the environment to increase the chances for language to occur, followed by incidental teaching, time delay, mand modeling, and modeling the response. Each intervention is used in a successive fashion if the previous intervention does not produce results.\n"}
{"id": "2315029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2315029", "title": "Neural adaptation", "text": "Neural adaptation\n\nNeural adaptation or sensory adaptation is a change over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as a change in the stimulus. For example, if a hand is rested on a table, the table's surface is immediately felt on the skin. After a little while though this is no longer felt. The sensory neurons that initially respond are no longer stimulated to respond; this is an example of neural adaptation.\n\nAll sensory and neural systems have a form of adaptation to constantly detect changes in the environment. Neural receptor cells that process and receive stimulation go through constant changes for mammals and other living organisms to sense vital changes in their environment. Some key players in several neural systems include Caions (see Calcium in biology) that send negative feedback in second messenger pathways that allow the neural receptor cells to close or open channels in response to the changes of ion flow. There are also mechanoreception systems that use calcium inflow to physically affect certain proteins and move them to close or open channels.\n\nFunctionally, it is highly possible that adaptation may enhance the limited response range of neurons to encode sensory signals with much larger dynamic ranges by shifting the range of stimulus amplitudes. Also, in neural adaptation there is a sense of returning to baseline from a stimulated response. Recent work suggests that these baseline states are actually determined by long-term adaptation to the environment. Varying rates or speed of adaptation is an important indicator for tracking different rates of change in the environment or the organism itself.\n\nCurrent research shows that although adaptation occurs at multiple stages of each sensory pathway, it is often stronger and more stimulus specific at “cortical” level rather than “subcortical stages.” In short, neural adaptation is thought to happen at a more central level at the cortex.\n\nThere is fast adaptation and slow adaptation. Fast adaptation occurs immediately after a stimulus is presented i.e., within hundreds of milliseconds. Slow adaptive processes can take minutes, hours or even days. The two classes of neural adaptation may rely on very different physiological mechanisms. The time scale over which adaptation builds up and recovers depends on the time course of stimulation. Brief stimulation produces adaptation which occurs and recovers while more prolonged stimulation can produce slower and more lasting forms of adaptation. Also, repeated sensory stimulation appears to temporarily decrease the gain of thalamocortical synaptic transmission. Adaptation of cortical responses was stronger and recovered more slowly.\n\nIn the late 1800s, Hermann Helmholtz, a German physician and physicist, extensively researched conscious sensations and different types of perception . He defined sensations as the \"raw elements\" of conscious experience that required no learning, and perceptions as the meaningful interpretations derived from the senses. He studied the physical properties of the eye and vision, as well as acoustic sensation. In one of his classic experiments regarding how space perception could be altered by experience, participants wore glasses that distorted the visual field by several degrees to the right. Participants were asked to look at an object, close their eyes, and try to reach out and touch it. At first, the subjects reached for the object too far to the left, but after a few trials were able to correct themselves.\n\nHelmholtz theorized that perceptual adaptation might result from a process he referred to as unconscious inference, where the mind unconsciously adopts certain rules in order to make sense of what is perceived of the world. An example of this phenomenon is when a ball appears to be getting smaller and smaller, the mind will then infer that the ball is moving away from them.\n\nIn the 1890s, psychologist George M. Stratton conducted experiments in which he tested the theory of perceptual adaptation. In one experiment, he wore a reversing glasses for 21½ hours over three days. After removing the glasses, \"normal vision was restored instantaneously and without any disturbance in the natural appearance or position of objects.\"\n\nOn a later experiment, Stratton wore the glasses for eight whole days. By day four, the images seen through the instrument were still upside down. However, on day five, images appeared upright until he concentrated on them; then they became inverted again. By having to concentrate on his vision to turn it upside down again, especially when he knew images were hitting his retinas in the opposite orientation as normal, Stratton deduced his brain had adapted to the changes in vision.\n\nStratton also conducted experiments where he wore glasses that altered his visual field by 45°. His brain was able to adapt to the change and perceive the world as normal. Also, the field can be altered making the subject see the world upside down. But, as the brain adjusts to the change, the world appears \"normal.\"\n\nIn some extreme experiments, psychologists have tested to see if a pilot can fly a plane with altered vision. All of the pilots that were fitted with the goggles that altered their vision were able to safely navigate the aircraft with ease.\n\nAdaptation is considered to be the cause of perceptual phenomena like afterimages and the motion aftereffect. In the absence of fixational eye movements, visual perception may fade out or disappear due to neural adaptation. (See Adaptation (eye)). When an observer's visual stream adapts to a single direction of real motion, imagined motion can be perceived at various speeds. If the imagined motion is in the same direction as that experienced during adaptation, imagined speed is slowed; when imagined motion is in the opposite direction, its speed is increased; when adaptation and imagined motions are orthogonal, imagined speed is unaffected. Studies using magnetoencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated that subjects exposed to a repeated visual stimulus at brief intervals become attenuated to the stimulus in comparison to the initial stimulus. The results revealed that visual responses to the repeated compared with novel stimulus showed a significant reduction in both activation strength and peak latency but not in the duration of neural processing.\n\nAlthough motion and images are extremely important regarding adaptation, the most important adaptation is adjusting to brightness levels. On entering a dark room or a very brightly lit room it takes a little while to adjust to the different levels. Adjusting to brightness levels allows mammals to detect changes in their surrounding. This is called dark adaptation.\n\nAuditory adaptation, as perceptual adaptation with other senses, is the process by which individuals adapt to sounds and noises. As research has shown, as time progresses, individuals tend to adapt to sounds and tend to distinguish them less frequently after a while. Sensory adaptation tends to blend sounds into one, variable sound, rather than having several separate sounds as a series. Moreover, after repeated perception, individuals tend to adapt to sounds to the point where they no longer consciously perceive it, or rather, \"block it out\". An individual that lives close to the train tracks, will eventually stop noticing the sounds of passing trains. Similarly, individuals living in larger cities no longer notice traffic sounds after a while. Moving to a completely different area, such as a quiet countryside, that individual would then be aware of the silence, crickets, etc.\n\nThe mechanoreception of sound requires a specific set of receptor cells called hair cells that allow for gradient signals to pass onto spatial ganglia where the signal will be sent to the brain to be processed. Since this is mechanoreception, different from chemoreception, adaptation of sound from surroundings highly depends on the physical movement of opening and closing of cation channels on the hair cell stereocilia. Mechanoelectric transduction (MET) channels, located at the tops of stereocilia, are poised to detect tension induced by hair bundle deflection. Hair bundle deflection generates a force by pulling on tip link proteins connecting adjacent stereocilia.\n\nPerceptual adaptation is a phenomenon that occurs for all of the senses, including smell and touch. An individual can adapt to a certain smell with time. Smokers, or individuals living with smokers, tend to stop noticing the smell of cigarettes after some time, whereas people not exposed to smoke on a regular basis will notice the smell instantly. The same phenomenon can be observed with other types of smell, such as perfume, flowers, etc. The human brain can distinguish smells that are unfamiliar to the individual, while adapting to those it is used to and no longer require to be consciously recognized.\n\nOlfactory neurons utilize a feedback system from the levels of Caions to activate its adaptation to prolonged smells. Due to the fact that the olfactory signal transduction uses a second messenger transduction system, the mechanism of adaptation includes several factors that mostly include CaMK or calmodulin bound to Caions.\n\nThis phenomenon also applies to the sense of touch. An unfamiliar piece of clothing that was just put on will be noticed instantly; however, once it has been worn for a while, the mind will adapt to its texture and ignore the stimulus.\n\nWhile large mechanosensory neurons such as type I/group Aß display adaptation, smaller type IV/group C nociceptive neurons do not. As a result, pain does not usually subside rapidly but persists for long periods of time; in contrast, other sensory information is quickly adapted to, if surroundings remain constant.\n\nStudies have shown that there is neural adaptation after as little as one weight training session. Strength gains are experienced by subjects without any increased muscle size. Muscle surface recordings using electromyographic (SEMG) techniques have found that early strength gains throughout training are associated with increased amplitude in SEMG activity. These findings along with various other theories explain increases in strength without increases in muscle mass. Other theories for increases in strength relating to neural adaptation include: agonist-antagonist muscle decreased co-activation, motor unit synchronization, and motor unit increased firing rates.\n\nNeural adaptations contribute to changes in V-waves and Hoffmann's reflex. H-reflex can be used to assess the excitability of spinal α-motoneurons, whereas V-wave measures the magnitude of motor output from α-motoneurons. Studies showed that after a 14-week resistance training regime, subjects expressed V-wave amplitude increases of ~50% and H-reflex amplitude increases of ~20%. This showed that neural adaptation accounts for changes to functional properties of the spinal cord circuitry in humans without affecting organization of the motor cortex.\n\nThe terms neural adaptation and habituation are often confused for one another. Habituation is a behavioral phenomenon while neural adaptation is a physiological phenomenon, although the two are not entirely separate. During habituation, one has some conscious control over whether one notices something to which one is becoming habituated. However, when it comes to neural adaptation, one has no conscious control over it. For example, if one has adapted to something (like an odor or perfume), one can not consciously force himself to smell that thing. Neural adaptation is tied very closely to stimulus intensity; as the intensity of a light increases, one's senses will adapt more strongly to it. In comparison, habituation can vary depending on the stimulus. With a weak stimulus habituation can occur almost immediately but with a strong stimulus the animal may not habituate at all e.g. a cool breeze versus a fire alarm. Habituation also has a set of characteristics that must be met to be termed a habituation process.\n\nShort term neural adaptations occur in the body during rhythmic activities. One of the most common activities when these neural adaptations are constantly happening is walking. As a person walks, the body constantly gathers information about the environment and the surroundings of the feet, and slightly adjusts the muscles in use according to the terrain. For example, walking uphill requires different muscles than walking on flat pavement. When the brain recognizes that the body is walking uphill, it makes neural adaptations that send more activity to muscles required for uphill walking.\nThe rate of neural adaptation is affected by the area of the brain and by the similarity between sizes and shapes of previous stimuli. Adaptations in the inferior temporal gyrus are very dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size, and somewhat dependent on previous stimuli being of a similar shape. Adaptations in the Prefrontal Cortex are less dependent on previous stimuli being of similar size and shape.\n\nSome rhythmic movements, such as respiratory movements, are essential for survival. Because these movements must be used over the course of the entire lifetime, it is important for them to function optimally. Neural adaptation has been observed in these movements in response to training or altered external conditions. Animals have been shown to have reduced breathing rates in response to better fitness levels. Since breathing rates were not conscious changes made by the animal, it is presumed that neural adaptations occur for the body to maintain a slower breathing rate.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an important technique in modern cognitive neuropsychology that is used to investigate the perceptual and behavioral effects of temporary interference of neural processing. Studies have shown that when a subject’s visual cortex is disrupted by TMS, the subject views colorless flashes of light, or phosphenes. When a subjects’ vision was subjected to the constant stimulus of a single color, neural adaptations occurred that made the subjects used to the color. Once this adaptation had occurred, TMS was used to disrupt the subjects’ visual cortex again, and the flashes of light viewed by the subject were the same color as the constant stimulus before the disruption.\n\nNeural adaptation can occur for other than natural means. Antidepressant drugs, such as those that cause down regulation of β-adrenergic receptors, can cause rapid neural adaptations in the brain. By creating a quick adaptation in the regulation of these receptors, it is possible for drugs to reduce the effects of stress on those taking the medication.\n\nStudies in children with early childhood brain injuries have shown that neural adaptations slowly occur after the injury. Children with early injuries to the linguistics, spatial cognition and affective development areas of the brain showed deficits in those areas as compared to those without injury. Due to neural adaptations, however, by early school-age, considerable development to those areas was observed.\n\n"}

Overexcitability is the translation of a Polish word 'nadpobudliwosc', which means 'superstimulatability' in English.\n\nIn his book \"Positive Disintegration\", Dabrowski uses the terms \"hyperexcitability\", \"increased excitability\" \"overexcitability\" and just \"excitability\". He uses these terms interchangeably with nervousness.\n\nDabrowski introduces these terms to describe a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. He describes those who have hyperexcitability as showing \"strength and perseveration of reactions incommensurate to their stimuli.\" Piechowski noted that Dabrowski used the term psychic overexcitability to \"underline the enhancement and intensification of mental activity much beyond the ordinary\". Also, unlike some other theories of development such as Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels, which are not tied to ages.\n\nThere are five forms of overexcitability. These five forms are psychomotor, sensual, emotional, imaginational and intellectual.\n\nPsychomotor: OE is a heightened excitability of the neuromuscular system. This manifests itself in a capacity for being active and energetic, a love of movement, a surplus of energy and an actual need for physical action.\n\nSensual: OE is an intensified experience of any type of sensual pleasure or displeasure emanating from one of the five senses, i.e. sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. It manifests as an increased appreciation of aesthetic pleasure such as music, language, and art, and delight from tastes, smells, textures, sounds, and sights. Conversely, we see extreme pain and disgust when exposed to sensations perceived as unpleasant.\n\nIntellectual: OE manifests itself as an extreme desire to seek understanding and truth, to gain knowledge, and to analyse and categorise information. Those high in Intellectual OE are commonly seen as intellectually gifted and have incredibly active minds. They are intensely curious, avid readers and keen observers. They frequently love thinking purely for the sake of thinking.\n\nImaginational: OE manifests as an intensified play of the imagination causing rich association of images, invention, fantasy, use of image and metaphor and elaborate dreams and visions. Often children high in Imaginational OE do not differentiate between truth and fiction, or are absorbed in their own private world with imaginary companions and dramatizations. \n\nEmotional: OE is characterised by heightened, intense feelings, extreme experience of complex emotions, identification with others' feelings to the point of actual experience and strong sentimental expression. Other indications include physical response to emotional stimuli such as stomachaches when nervous and obsessive concern with death and depression. Emotionally overexcitable people have a strong capacity for deep relationships; they show strong emotional attachments to people, places, and things. They are empathetic, compassionate and extremely sensitive.\n\nAccording to Dabrowski, a person who manifests any given form of overexcitability and especially one who manifests several forms of overexcitability, sees reality in a different, stronger and more multisided manner.\n\nA small amount of definitive research has led to the belief that intensity, sensitivity and overexcitability are primary characteristics of the highly gifted. The association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research. It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dąbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth. The term \"overexcitability\" was popularized in the gifted education community by scholars such as Sal Mendaglio, who edited Dabrowski's \"Theory of Positive Disintegration\" and Susan Daniels and Michael M. Piechowski, who edited \"Living with Intensity\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Resources can be owned by (and hence be the property of) individuals, associations or governments. Property rights can be viewed as an attribute of an economic good. This attribute has four broad components and is often referred to as a bundle of rights:\n\nIn economics, property is usually considered to be ownership (rights to the proceeds generated by the property) and control over a resource or good. Many economists effectively argue that property rights need to be fixed and need to portray the relationships among other parties in order to be more effective.\n\nProperty rights to a good must be defined, their use must be monitored, and possession of rights must be enforced.The costs of defining, monitoring, and enforcing property rights are termed transaction costs. Depending on the level of transaction costs, various forms of property rights institutions will develop. Each institutional form can be described by the distribution of rights.\n\nThe following list is ordered from no property rights defined to all property rights being held by individuals\n\nImplicit or explicit property rights can be created by regulating the environment, either through prescriptive command and control approaches (e.g. limits on input/output/discharge quantities, specified processes/equipment, audits) or by market-based instruments (e.g. taxes, transferable permits or quotas), and more recently through cooperative, self-regulatory, post-regulatory and reflexive law approaches. See the Conservation Property Right\n\nIt has been proposed by Ronald Coase that clearly defining and assigning property rights would resolve environmental problems by internalizing externalities and relying on incentives of private owners to conserve resources for the future. At common law nuisance and tort law allows adjacent property holders to seek compensation when individual actions diminish the air and water quality for adjacent landowners.\nCritics of this view argue that this assumes that it is possible to internalize all environmental benefits, that owners will have perfect information, that scale economies are manageable, transaction costs are bearable, and that legal frameworks operate efficiently.\n\nIn 2013 researchers produced an annotated bibliography on the property rights literature concerned with two principal outcomes: (a) reduction in investors risk and increase in incentives to invest, and (b) improvements in household welfare; the researchers explored the channels through which property rights affect growth and household welfare in developing countries. They found that better protection of property rights can affect several development outcomes, including better management of natural resources.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence on the economic relevance of property rights however, only recently economists have begun to study their determinants by looking at the trade-off between the dispersed coercive power in a state of anarchy and the predation by a central authority. To illustrate, incomplete property rights allow agents with valuation lower than that of the original owners of economic value to inefficiently expropriate them distorting in this way their investment and effort exertion decisions. When instead, the state is entrusted the power to protect property, it might directly expropriate private parties if not sufficiently constrained by an efficient political process. The necessity of strong protection of property for efficiency has been however criticized by a vast legal scholarship, originated from the seminal contribution by Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed. These authors argue that in the face of transaction costs sufficiently sizeable to prevent consensual trade, legalized private expropriation in the form of, for instance, liability rules can be welfare-increasing. Carmine Guerriero blends these two different strands of literature by linking property rights protection, transaction costs, and preference heterogeneity. To elaborate, when property is fully protected, some agents with valuation higher than that of the original owners will be unable to legally acquire value because of sizable transaction costs. When the protection of property is weak instead, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. Hence, a rise in the heterogeneity of the potential buyers' valuations makes inefficient expropriation by low-valuation potential buyers be more important from a social welfare point of view than inefficient exclusion from trade and so induces stronger property rights. Crucially, this prediction survives even after considering production and investment activities and it is consistent with a novel dataset on the rules on the acquisition of ownership through adverse possession and on the use of government takings to transfer real property from a private party to another private party prevailing in 126 jurisdictions. These data measure “horizontal property rights” and thus the extent of protection of property from “direct and indirect private takings,” which are ubiquitous forms of expropriation that occur daily within the rule of law and are thus different from predation by the state and the elites, which is much less common but has been the focus of the economics literature. To capture preference diversity, the author uses the contemporary genetic diversity, which is a primitive metric of the genealogical distance between populations with a common ancestor and so of the differences in characteristics transmitted across generations, such as preferences. Regression analysis reveals that the protection of the original owners' property rights is the strongest where contemporary genetic diversity is the largest. Evidence from several different identification strategies suggests that this relationship is indeed causal.\n\nThe property rights approach to the theory of the firm based on the incomplete contracting paradigm was developed by Sanford Grossman, Oliver Hart, and John Moore. These authors argue that in the real world, contracts are incomplete and hence it is impossible to contractually specify what decisions will have to be taken in any conceivable state of the world. There will be renegotiations in the future, so parties have insufficient investment incentives (since they will only get a fraction of the investment's return in future negotiations); i.e., there is a hold-up problem. Hence, property rights matter, because they determine who has control over future decisions if no agreement will be reached. In other words, property rights determine the parties' future bargaining positions (while their bargaining powers, i.e. their fractions of the renegotiation surplus, are independent of the property rights allocation). The property rights approach to the theory of the firm can thus explain pros and cons of integration in the context of private firms. Yet, it has also been applied in various other frameworks such as public good provision and privatization. The property rights approach has been extended in many directions. For instance, some authors have studied different bargaining solutions, while other authors have studied the role of asymmetric information.\n\nClassical economists such as Adam Smith and Karl Marx generally recognize the importance of property rights in the process of economic development, and modern mainstream economics agree with such a recognition. A widely-accepted explanation is that well-enforced property rights provide incentives for individuals to participate in economic activities, such as investment, innovation and trade, which lead to a more efficient market. The development of property rights in Europe during the Middle Ages provides an example. During this epoch, full political power came into the hands of hereditary monarchies, which often abused their power to exploit producers, to impose arbitrary taxes, or to refuse to pay their debts. The lack of protection for property rights provided little incentive for landowners and merchants to invest in land, physical or human capital, or technology. After the English Civil War of 1642-1646 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688, shifts of political power away from the Stuart monarchs led to the strengthening of property rights of both land and capital owners. Consequently, rapid economic development took place, setting the stage for Industrial Revolution.\n\nProperty rights are also believed to lower transaction costs by providing an efficient resolution for conflicts over scarce resources. Empirically, using historical data of former European colonies, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson find substantial evidence that good economic institutions – those that provide secure property rights and equality of opportunity – lead to economic prosperity.\n\nProperty rights might be closely related to the evolution of political order, due to their protections of an individual's claims on economic rents. North, Wallis and Weingast argue that property rights originate to facilitate elites' rent-seeking activities. Particularly, the legal and political systems that protect elites' claims on rent revenues form the basis of the so-called \"limited access order\", in which non-elites are denied access to political power and economic privileges. In a historical study of medieval England, for instance, North and Thomas find that the dramatic development of English land laws in the 13th century resulted from elites' interests in exploiting rent revenues from land ownership after a sudden rise in land price in the 12th century. In contrast, the modern \"open access order\", which consists of a democratic political system and a free- market economy, usually features widespread, secure and impersonal property rights. Universal property rights, along with impersonal economic and political competition, downplay the role of rent-seeking and instead favor innovations and productive activities in a modern economy.\n"}
{"id": "33916642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33916642", "title": "Queer pornography", "text": "Queer pornography\n\nQueer pornography depicts performers with various gender identities and sexual orientations interacting and exploring genres of desire and pleasure in unique ways. These conveyed interactions distinctively seek to challenge the conventional modes of portraying and experiencing sexually explicit content. Scholar Ingrid Ryberg additionally includes two main objectives of queer pornography in her definition as \"interrogating and troubling gender and sexual categories and aiming at sexual arousal.\"\n\nQueer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the sexual orientations, gender identities and desires of the performers in it. It differs from heterosexual pornography, gay pornography, or lesbian pornography, because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories. Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar Richard Dyer argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior. To appear as inclusive, gay porn will exotify differences. Performers' bodies in queer pornography are key to providing a difference between it and other categories of pornography. For example, a DVD may have one scene which shows a transgender lesbian with a cisgender femme-identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men.\n\nThe genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as Pink and White Productions, Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video.\n\nSome prominent queer producers include Shine Louise Houston, Chelsea Poe, and April Flores who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the porn industry. Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers’ salaries based on their popularity. Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system.\n\nQueer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a \"money shot.\" Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it. Since the money shot in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure. Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.\n\nQueer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s. A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any heterosexual mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn’s concept of the “pornoscript,” eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position. For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions’s \"Fluid\" depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film’s adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like heteronormative pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose gender construction within most conventional pornography. This process creates a queer version of the model of \"subversive repetition\" theorized by academic Judith Butler. Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it.\n\nAdditionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male trans men appear significantly in feminist and queer pornography.\n\nFilms of queer pornography make \"deviant\" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their normalization. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the gender system. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a \"real\" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power.\n\nAs scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, “If heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities”.\n\n\n\n"}

Skinner and is his \"philosophy of the science of behavior.\" It refers to the philosophy behind behavior analysis, and is to be distinguished from methodological behaviorism—which has an intense emphasis on observable behaviors—by its inclusion of thinking, feeling, and other private events in the analysis of human and animal psychology. The research in behavior analysis is called the experimental analysis of behavior and the application of this field is called applied behavior analysis (ABA), which was originally termed \"behavior modification.\"\n\nRadical behaviorism inherits from behaviorism the position that the science of behavior is a natural science, a belief that animal behavior can be studied profitably and compared with human behavior, a strong emphasis on the environment as cause of behavior, and an emphasis on the operations involved in the modification of behavior. Radical behaviorism does not claim that organisms are \"tabula rasa\" whose behavior is unaffected by biological or genetic endowment. Rather, it simply asserts that experiential factors play a major role in determining the behavior of many complex organisms, and that the study of these matters is a major field of research in its own right.\n\nThe most precise way to describe radical behaviorism as \"radical\" is to understand that instances such as evolution and cell division are occurrences that just happen. There is no 3rd party that assists in this transformation, they can however be explained by other naturally occurring events. They should not try to be explained through objects that are not tangible i.e. ghosts or inner entities. We therefore conclude that natural occurring events may be examined in relation to our past and present environments through the effect they have on human beings.\n\nAlthough there are many criticisms of Skinner's work, many textbooks and theorists like Noam Chomsky label Skinnerian or radical behaviorism as S–R (stimulus–response, or to use Skinner's term, \"respondent\"), or Pavlovian psychology, and argue that this limits the approach. Although contemporary psychology rejects many of Skinner's conclusions, his work into operant conditioning which emphasizes the importance of consequences in modifying discriminative responses is useful when combined with current understandings about the uniqueness of evolved human thought over other animals .\nMany textbooks argue that radical behaviorism maintains the position that animals (including humans) are passive receivers of conditioning, failing to take into account that:\n\nRadical behaviorism is often dismissed as logical positivism. Skinnerians maintain that Skinner was not a logical positivist and recognized the importance of thinking as behavior. This position is made quite clear in \"About Behaviorism\". A clearer position for radical behaviorism seems to be the movement known philosophically as American pragmatism.\n\nFor a review and summary of Skinner's book \"Verbal Behavior\" see the article Verbal Behavior.\n\nSkinner saw that classical conditioning did not account for the behavior most of us are interested in, such as riding a bike or writing a book. His observations led him to propose a theory about how these and similar behaviors, called operants, come about.\n\nRoughly speaking, in operant conditioning, an operant is actively emitted and produces changes in the world (i.e., produces consequences) that alter the likelihood that the behavior will occur again.\n\nAs represented in the table below, operant conditioning involves two basic actions (increasing or decreasing the probability that a specific behavior will occur in the future), which are accomplished by adding or removing one of two basic types of stimuli, positive reinforcers or negative reinforcers .\n\nIn other words:\nInstrumental conditioning is another term for operant conditioning that is most closely associated with scientists who studied running through a maze. Skinner pioneered the free operant technique, where organisms could respond at any time during a protracted experimental session. Thus Skinner's dependent variable was usually the frequency or rate of responding, not the errors that were made or the speed of traversal of a maze.\n\nOperant conditioning affects the future of the organism, that is how the organism will respond after the actions summarized above occur.\n\nJohn B. Watson argued against the use of references to mental states and held that psychology should study behavior directly, holding private events as impossible to study scientifically. Skinner rejected this position conceding the importance of thinking, feelings and \"inner behavior\" in his analysis. Skinner did not hold to truth by agreement, as Watson did, so he was not limited by observation.\n\nIn Watson's days (and in Skinner's early days), it was held that psychology was at a disadvantage as a science because behavioral explanations should take physiology into account. Very little was known about physiology at the time. Skinner argued that behavioral explanations of psychological phenomena are \"just as true\" as physiological explanations. In arguing this, he took a non-reductionistic approach to psychology. Skinner, however, redefined behavior to include \"everything that an organism does,\" including thinking, feeling and speaking and argued that these phenomena were valid subject matters. (The challenge was that objective observation and measurement was often impossible.) The term \"radical behaviorism\" refers to just this: that \"everything\" an organism does is a behavior [quotes and references necessary here].\n\nHowever, Skinner ruled out thinking and feeling as valid \"explanations\" of behavior. The reasoning is this:\n\nThinking and feeling are not epiphenomena nor have they any other special status, and are just more behavior to explain. Explaining behavior by referring to thought or feelings are pseudo-explanations because they merely point to more behavior to be explained. Skinner proposed environmental factors as proper causes of behavior because:\n\nThis holds only for explaining the class of behaviors known as operant behaviors. This class of behavior Skinner held as the most interesting study matter.\n\nMany textbooks, in noting the emphasis Skinner places on the environment, argue that Skinner held that the organism is a blank slate or a \"tabula rasa\". Skinner wrote extensively on the limits and possibilities nature places on conditioning. Conditioning is implemented in the body as a physiological process and is subject to the current state, learning history, and history of the species. Skinner does not consider people a blank slate, or \"tabula rasa\".\n\nMany textbooks seem to confuse Skinner's rejection of physiology with Watson's rejection of private events. It \"is\" true to some extent that Skinner's psychology considers humans a black box, since Skinner maintains that behavior can be explained without taking into account what goes on in the organism. However, the black box is not private events, but physiology. Skinner considers physiology as useful, interesting, valid, etc., but not necessary for operant behavioral theory and research.\n\n[The author of this material has to present quotations and references for it appears that the writer is interpreting radical behaviorism rather than describing Skinner’s radical behaviorism.]\n\nRadical behaviorism differs from other forms of behaviorism in that it treats everything we do as behavior, including private events such as thinking and feeling. Unlike John B. Watson's behaviorism, private events are not dismissed as \"epiphenomena,\" but are seen as subject to the same principles of learning and modification as have been discovered to exist for overt behavior. Although private events are not publicly observable behaviors, radical behaviorism accepts that we are each observers of our own private behavior.\n\nMany textbooks, in emphasizing that Skinner held behavior to be the proper subject matter of psychology, fail to clarify Skinner's position and implicitly or even explicitly posit that Skinner ruled out the study of private events as unscientific. This is Watson's position, not Skinner's. [citations needed]\n\nThere are radical behaviorist schools of animal training, management, clinical practice, and education. Skinner's political views have left their mark in small ways as principles adopted by a small handful of utopian communities such as Los Horcones, and in ongoing challenges to aversive techniques in control of human and animal behavior.\n\nRadical behaviorism has generated numerous descendants. Examples of these include molar approaches associated with Richard Herrnstein and William Baum, Howard Rachlin's teleological behaviorism, William Timberlake's behavior systems approach, and John Staddon's theoretical behaviorism.\n\nSkinner's theories on verbal behavior have seen widespread application in therapies for autistic children that are based on applied behavior analysis (ABA). [This statement appears to be an error in view of the MacPherson, Bonem, Green, and Osborne 1984 paper that states Skinner’s “verbal behavior“ (1957) led to no research.]\n\nCriticisms of Behaviourism focus on its supposed theoretical weaknesses as well as its \"cold\" methods. Psychologists today consider this classical form of behaviorism to be \"wrong\" in the sense that modern cognitive research has attempted to clearly demonstrate the role of mental processes in psychology. A famous, but gruesome line of experimentation by noted psychologist Martin Seligman has been used to demonstrate behaviorism's inability to explain learned helplessness. Dogs, which had previously been placed in cages with fully electrified and inescapable floors, later never bothered to discover that newer cages they were placed in had a non-electrified section (separated by a short 'wall' that control dogs had no difficulty hopping). Instead, they laid down and quietly suffered. According to the critiques this demonstrated that, internally, the dogs perceived a lack of control over their environment. This is why they never bothered to remove themselves from the aversive stimulus when they had the option. However, this phenomena can be described and predicted from a behaviorist framework as well. Through a process of extinction the dogs had learned that escaping did not lead to the negative reinforcement of escaping the shocks. Hence, they stopped trying.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3306703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3306703", "title": "Reciprocal determinism", "text": "Reciprocal determinism\n\nReciprocal determinism is the theory set forth by psychologist Albert Bandura which states that a person's behavior both influences and is influenced by personal factors and the social environment. Bandura accepts the possibility that an individual's behavior may be conditioned through the use of consequences. At the same time he asserts that a person's behavior (and personal factors, such as cognitive skills or attitudes) can impact the environment. These skill sets result in an under- or overcompensated ego that, for all creative purposes, is too strong or too weak to focus on pure outcome. This is important because Bandura was able to prove the strong correlation between this with experiments.\n\nBandura was able to show this when he created the Bandura's Box experiment. As an example, Bandura's reciprocal determinism could occur when a child is acting out in school. The child doesn't like going to school; therefore, he/she acts out in class. This results in teachers and administrators of the school disliking having the child around. When confronted by the situation, the child admits he/she hates school and other peers don't like him/her. This results in the child acting inappropriately, forcing the administrators who dislike having him/her around to create a more restrictive environment for children of this stature. Each behavioral and environmental factor coincides with the child and so forth resulting in a continuous battle on all three levels.\n\nReciprocal determinism is the idea that behavior is controlled or determined by the individual, through cognitive processes, and by the environment, through external social stimulus events. The basis of reciprocal determinism should transform individual behavior by allowing subjective thought processes transparency when contrasted with cognitive, environmental, and external social stimulus events.\n\nActions do not go one way or the other, as it is affected by repercussions, meaning one's behavior is complicated and can't be thought of as individual and environmental means. Behavior consist of environmental and individual parts that interlink together to function. Many studies showed reciprocal associations between people and their environments over time.\n\nResearch conducted in this field include the study of doctor-patient relationships where one group of patients are termed 'physician-reliant' and the other group 'self-reliant'. The physician-reliant patients tend to be more passive in their decision making and rely on their physicians to make their choices for them. Self-reliant patients take a more active role in deciding which health options would better suit them.\n\nAnother relevant research is regarding the reciprocal determinism of self-efficacy and mathematical performance. It shows that reciprocal determinism may not be the appropriate model in all cultures but does take place in most. Self-efficacy is a conceptualized assessment of the person's competence to perform a specific task. Self-efficacy results from success or failures that arise in attempts to learn a task. Self-efficacy, measure by a personal confidence level before each question, and the mathematical scores were obtained in 41 countries for the study by Kitty and Trevor Williams. The reciprocal determinism of mathematics self-efficacy and achievement was found in 26 of the 30 nations. They suggest that this might be a fundamental psychological process that takes place across national boundaries.\nAccording to Albert Bandura, self-efficacy is defined as a person's belief in their capability to accomplish a certain task. Another study looked at the relationship of self-efficacy and job culture with job satisfaction among athletic trainers. The study used Bandura's triadic reciprocal causation model as a template to label job satisfaction as the behavioural factor, self-efficacy as the personal factor, and job culture as the environmental factor.\n\nTriadic reciprocal causation is a term introduced by Albert Bandura to refer to the mutual influence between three sets of factors:\n\nBehavioral genetics is a relatively new field of study attempting to make sense of both genetic and environmental contributions to individual variations in human behavior. Genes can be turned on and off. Multiple genes are factors in forming behavior traits.\n\nResearchers believe there is a genetic link to impulsive aggression through the impact of a gene on the production of an enzyme called Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA). The MAOA gene reduces the production of MAOA, leading to increased incidents of impulsive aggression. A 26-year study in New Zealand found strong correlation between experience of childhood abuse and criminal or violent behavior in males with the MAOA gene. In that study, impulsive aggression was found to be nine times more likely to manifest in males with the gene who were abused than in abused males without the gene or males with the gene who had not been abused.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3253", "title": "Running amok", "text": "Running amok\n\nRunning amok, sometimes referred to as simply amok or gone amok, also spelled amuk, from the Southeast Asian Austronesian languages (especially Malaysian and Indonesian), is \"an episode of sudden mass assault against people or objects usually by a single individual following a period of brooding that has traditionally been regarded as occurring especially in Malay culture but is now increasingly viewed as psychopathological behavior\". The syndrome of \"Amok\" is found in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-IV TR). The phrase is often used in a less serious manner when describing something that is wildly out of control or causing a frenzy (e.g., a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be termed as \"running amok\").\n\nAmok originated from the Malaysian/Indonesian word \"meng-âmuk\", which when roughly defined means \"to make a furious and desperate charge\". According to Malaysian and Indonesian cultures, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief. They believed that amok was caused by the \"hantu belian\", which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.\n\nAlthough commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic culture-bound syndrome in the cultures of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. In a typical case of \"running amok\", an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself. Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing suicide, eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized. Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.\n\nAn early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of Captain James Cook, a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and \"indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack.\"\n\nA widely accepted explanation links amok with male honor (amok by women and children is virtually unknown).\nRunning amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed or committed suicide) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.\n\n\"Running amok\" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities. An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms \"going postal\" or \"going ballistic\" are similar in scope.\nPolice describe such an event as a killing spree. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often \"suicide by cop\".\n\nAmok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome, which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are latah and koro. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of dissociative disorders (cross-cultural variant).\n\nIn 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill. The modern DSM-IV method of classification of mental disorders contains two official types of amok disorder; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.\n\nEarly travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.\n\nAn example would be during the Battle of Bukit Chandu in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by Adnan Saidi, charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.\n\nThis form of amok appears to resemble the Germanic \"Berserker\", the \"cafard\" or \"cathard\" (Polynesia), \"mal de pelea\" (Puerto Rico), and \"iich'aa\" (Navaho).\n\nIn contemporary Indonesia, the term \"amok\" (\"amuk\") generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. Laurens van der Post experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:\n\nIn the Philippines, \"amok\" also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines José Malcampo coined the term \"juramentado\" for the behavior (from \"juramentar\" - \"to take an oath\"), surviving into modern Philippine languages as \"huramentado\". It has historically been linked with the Moro people of Mindanao, particularly in the Sulu Archipelago, in connection with societal and cultural pressures.\n\nNorse Berserkers and the Zulu battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, some notable cases have occurred among the Rajputs. In 1634, the eldest son of the raja of Jodhpur ran amok at the court of Shah Jahan, failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at Hyderabad (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.\n\n"}

The sangmin were considered \"clean workers\" but had little social status. Generally they were poor. They paid most of Korea's taxes and were subject to the military draft.

Others rented land from the yangban as tenant farmers. Those that did not farm had the lowest status. In everyday life, the sangmin were the working people who struggled to survive.

If the points are color-coded, one additional variable can be displayed.\nThe data are displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis.\n\nA scatter plot can be used either when one continuous variable that is under the control of the experimenter and the other depends on it or when both continuous variables are independent. If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the \"control parameter\" or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. If no dependent variable exists, either type of variable can be plotted on either axis and a scatter plot will illustrate only the degree of correlation (not causation) between two variables.\n\nA scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval. For example, weight and height, weight would be on y axis and height would be on the x axis. Correlations may be positive (rising), negative (falling), or null (uncorrelated). If the pattern of dots slopes from lower left to upper right, it indicates a positive correlation between the variables being studied. If the pattern of dots slopes from upper left to lower right, it indicates a negative correlation. A line of best fit (alternatively called 'trendline') can be drawn in order to study the relationship between the variables. An equation for the correlation between the variables can be determined by established best-fit procedures. For a linear correlation, the best-fit procedure is known as linear regression and is guaranteed to generate a correct solution in a finite time. No universal best-fit procedure is guaranteed to generate a correct solution for arbitrary relationships. A scatter plot is also very useful when we wish to see how two comparable data sets agree to show nonlinear relationships between variables. The ability to do this can be enhanced by adding a smooth line such as LOESS. Furthermore, if the data are represented by a mixture model of simple relationships, these relationships will be visually evident as superimposed patterns.\n\nThe scatter diagram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control.\n\nScatter charts can be built in the form of bubble, marker, or/and line charts.\n\nFor example, to display a link between a person's lung capacity, and how long that person could hold his/her breath, a researcher would choose a group of people to study, then measure each one's lung capacity (first variable) and how long that person could hold his/her breath (second variable). The researcher would then plot the data in a scatter plot, assigning \"lung capacity\" to the horizontal axis, and \"time holding breath\" to the vertical axis.\n\nA person with a lung capacity of 400 cl who held his/her breath for 21.7 seconds would be represented by a single dot on the scatter plot at the point (400, 21.7) in the Cartesian coordinates. The scatter plot of all the people in the study would enable the researcher to obtain a visual comparison of the two variables in the data set, and will help to determine what kind of relationship there might be between the two variables.\n\nFor a set of data variables (dimensions) X, X, ... , X, the scatter plot matrix shows all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single view with multiple scatterplots in a matrix format. For k variables, the scatterplot matrix will contain k rows and k columns. A plot located on the intersection of i-th row and j-th column is a plot of variables X versus X. This means that each row and column is one dimension, and each cell plots a scatterplot of two dimensions.\n\nA generalized scatterplot matrix offers a range of displays of paired combinations of categorical and quantitative variables. A mosaic plot, fluctuation diagram, or faceted bar chart may be used to display two categorical variables. Other plots are used for one categorical and one quantitative variables.\n"}

The body has become a social construction, in whose delimitation have participated multiple disciplines. Thus, medicine and religion can be mentioned as the agents that have traditionally influenced, together with the rules of urbanity and educational institutions. These four agents have been building a model, which every individual has as reference. According to Bryan S. Turner, the social construction of the body is: \"The nearest and immediate feature of my social self, a necessary feature of my social situation and my personal identity, and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural environment\"\n"}
{"id": "43851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43851", "title": "Social norm", "text": "Social norm\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, social norms are informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society. Social psychology recognizes smaller group units, such as a team or an office, may also endorse norms separately or in addition to cultural or societal expectations. In other words, norms are regarded as collective representations of acceptable group conduct as well as individual perceptions of particular group conduct. They can be viewed as cultural products (including values, customs, and traditions) which represent individuals' basic knowledge of what others do and think that they should do.\n\nFurthermore, in the field of social psychology, the roles of norms are emphasized which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as \"mental representations of appropriate behavior\".<ref name=\"aarts & dijksterhuis/\"></ref> For example, it has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior, including decreasing alcohol use and increasing voter turnout. According to the psychological definition of social norms' behavioral component, norms have two dimensions: how much a behaviour is exhibited, and how much the group approves of that behavior. Both of these dimensions can be used in normative messages to alter norms and subsequently alter behaviors; for example, a message can target the former dimension by describing high levels of voter turnout in order to encourage more turnout. At the same time, norms also can be changed contingent on the observed behavior of others (how much behavior is exhibited).\n\nNorms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society. For example, Crandall (1988) noted that certain groups (e.g., cheerleading squads, dance troupes, sports teams, sororities) have a rate of bulimia, a publicly recognized life-threatening disease, that is much higher than society as a whole. Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups.\n\nAlthough not considered to be formal laws within society, norms still work to promote a great deal of social control. They are statements that regulate conduct. The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances. Ranging in variations depending on culture, race, religion, and geographical location, it is the foundation of the terms some know acceptable as not to injure others, the golden rule, and to keep promises that have been pledged. Without them, there would be a world without consensus, common ground, or restrictions. Even though the law and a state's legislation is not intended to control social norms, society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other. This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted. For example, the criminalisation of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable, however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives. The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned, even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships.\n\nSocial norms can be enforced formally (e.g., through sanctions) or informally (e.g., through body language and non-verbal communication cues.) Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership, groups are said to control \"discretionary stimuli\"; groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members' adherence to group norms, effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning. Social psychology research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self, the more likely he is to conform. Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival, since they represent a codification of belief; groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about. Norms in every culture create conformity that allows for people to become socialized to the culture in which they live. \nAs social beings, individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things, to use certain words, to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes, and when it is not. Thus, knowledge about cultural norms is important for impressions, which is an individual's regulation of their nonverbal behavior. One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around. Typically, this knowledge is derived through experience (i.e. social norms are learned through social interaction). Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the white collar work force.\n\nFor Talcott Parsons of the functionalist school, norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters. On the other hand, Karl Marx believed that norms are used to promote the creation of roles in society which allows for people of different levels of social class structure to be able to function properly. Marx claims that this power dynamic creates social order.\n\nHeinrich Popitz is convinced that the establishment of social norms, that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego, solves the problem of contingency (Niklas Luhmann). In this way, ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution; social interaction is thus accelerated. Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions and social roles.\n\nRulemaking is one of the basic impulses humans have for organizing and simplifying actions. Everyday there are new rules put into place, as well as old rules that are more structured whether it be for a group or an individual. Yet, not only do humans make rules, they strive on finding the rules that come eye to eye about how the world works. These rules, once accepted by an individual or a group after trial and error, then become a norm.\n\nGroups may adopt norms through a variety of ways. Norms can arise formally, where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations. Laws or club rules serve as an example of this. A large number of these norms we follow 'naturally' such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK, or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket. Many formal norms serve to provide safety to the general public.\n\nHowever, social norms are much more likely to develop informally, emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior. Not necessarily laws set in writing, informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life. These informal norms, if broken, may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions, but instead encourage reprimands, warnings, or othering; incest, for example, is generally thought of as wrong in society, but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it.\n\nIndividuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group, which can get adopted over time. Without a clear indication of how to act, people typically rely on their past history to determine the best course forward; what was successful before may serve them well again. In a group, individuals may all import different histories or scripts about appropriate behaviors; common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action, usually with the integration of several members' schemas. Under the importation paradigm, norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer.\n\nGroups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behaviour within the group. Once firmly established, a norm becomes a part of the group's operational structure and hence more difficult to change. While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms, it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group's norms, values, and perspectives, rather than the other way around.\n\nDeviance is defined as \"nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society.\" More simply put, if group members do not follow a norm, they become labeled as a deviant. In the sociological literature, this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society. Yet, deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected. Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action, the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal. Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R. Shaw. What is considered \"normal\" is relative to the location of the culture in which the social interaction is taking place. In psychology, an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the \"institutionalized deviant.\" Similar to the sociological definition, institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms. At first, group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist, attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations. The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will affect others. Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better, groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual's behavior back into line. Over time, however, if a member continues to disobey, the group will give up on him as a lost cause; while the group may not necessarily revoke his membership, they may give him only superficial consideration. If a worker is late to a meeting, for example, violating the office norm of punctuality, a boss or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened. If the behavior continues, eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual \"is always late.\" The group generalizes the individual's disobedience and promptly dismisses it, thereby reducing the member's influence and footing in future group disagreements.\n\nGroup tolerance for deviation varies across membership; not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations. Individuals may build up a \"reserve\" of good behavior through conformity, which they can borrow against later. These \"idiosyncrasy credits\" provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations. A teacher, for example, may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehaving—who has past \"good credit\" saved up—than a repeatedly disruptive student. While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits, some group members have a higher balance to start with. Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group; childhood movie stars, for example, who enroll in college, may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen. Finally, leaders or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and be appear to be \"above the rules\" at times. Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless, however; while held to a more lenient standard than the average member, leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme.\n\nDeviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm. One of those emotions can be widely attributed to guilt. This emotion is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation. Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing. It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling. Used in both instances, it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment. Using the metaphor of \"dirty hands\", it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth. It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others. Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further \"honorable\" actions.\n\nThe probability of these actions that are committed are coined to B. F. Skinner, that states that operant conditioning plays a role in the process of social norm. Operant conditioning is the increase that an action will occur again by increasing the reinforced response. This process is that of reward and punishment or trial and error. Hand in hand with deviance, the consequences of one’s behavior, whether positive or negative, will determine the probability of reoccurrence as well as the push towards regulating one’s decisions in the future. Containing five sub categories, this conditioning treatment is an influence in the actions one commits and the feelings one experiences afterwards. In the case of social deviance, an individual who has gone against a norm will feel the negative connotation that comes with defying the conditioning that was taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement. A perfect example is that of a little girl painting on the wall of the house as she seeks her mother’s approval of her artistic work. When the child witnesses the mother putting her in a \"time out\", she realizes that if she were to paint on the wall again, it will lead to punishment therefore causing her to notice her negative reinforcement. Which then makes the probability of her painting the wall again, decrease immensely. He also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in. Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us, deviance is a frowned upon action.\n\nCialdini, Reno, and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once; expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural, situational or personal norms motivate action, the researchers suggested the focus of an individual’s attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow.\n\nDescriptive norms depict what happens, while injunctive norms describe what \"should\" happen. Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren (1990) define a descriptive norm as people's perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations; it signifies what most people do, without assigning judgment. The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot, for example, transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not litter. An Injunctive norm, on the other hand, transmits group approval about a particular behavior; it dictates how an individual \"should\" behave. Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out, a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter.\n\nPrescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do. Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture. Proscriptive norms, in contrast, comprise the other end of the same spectrum; they are similarly society's unwritten rules about what one should not do. These norms can vary between cultures; while an acceptable greeting in some European countries, kissing a stranger on the cheek constitutes a proscriptive norm in the United States.\n\nSubjective norm is determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want them to perform a behavior. Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform, or not to perform, a behavior.\n\nOver the last few decades, several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view. By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence, theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform. The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms, suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes. Under these theoretical frameworks, choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate, quantifiable decision.\n\nDeveloped in the 1960s, the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms. In the regular coordinate plane, the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis (label \"a\" in Figure 1) while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis (\"b\" in Figure 1). The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm. Theoretically, one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action. For example, it may be the case that among first-year graduate students, strong social norms around how many daily cups of coffee you drink exist. If the return curve in Figure 1 correctly displays the example social norm, we can see that if someone drinks 0 cups of coffee a day, the group strongly disapproves. The group does not approve of member behavior until someone hits four cups of coffee a day; the graduate students (as represented by the return curve) find it excessive to drink more than seven cups, however, as the approval again dips below zero. As exhibited by the coffee example, the return potential model displays for each increment of behavior how much group approval one can anticipate.\n\nAnother general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the repeated game of game theory. Rational choice, a branch of game theory, deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents. A norm gives a person a rule of thumb for how they should behave. However, a rational person only acts according to the rule if it is optimal for them. The situation can be described as follows. A norm gives an expectation of how other people act in a given situation (macro). A person acts optimally given the expectation (micro). For a norm to be stable, people's actions must reconstitute the expectation without change (micro-macro feedback loop). A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a Nash equilibrium. Thus, a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium. In the Nash equilibrium, no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action. Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches.\n\nFrom a game-theoretical point of view, there are two explanations for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world. One is the difference in games. Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values, which may result in a difference in games. The other is equilibrium selection not explicable by the game itself. Equilibrium selection is closely related to coordination. For a simple example, driving is common throughout the world, but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left (see coordination game). A framework called comparative institutional analysis is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms.\n"}

P. Snow. Its thesis was that \"the intellectual life of the whole of western society\" was split into the titular two cultures – namely the sciences and the humanities – and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.\n\nThe Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution (1959) was a published version of the lectures in book form. \n\nThe talk was delivered 7 May 1959 in the Senate House, Cambridge, and subsequently published as \"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\". The lecture and book expanded upon an article by Snow published in the \"New Statesman\" of 6 October 1956, also entitled \"The Two Cultures\". Published in book form, Snow's lecture was widely read and discussed on both sides of the Atlantic, leading him to write a 1963 follow-up, \"The Two Cultures: And a Second Look: An Expanded Version of The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\".\n\nSnow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:\nIn 2008, \"The Times Literary Supplement\" included \"The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution\" in its list of the 100 books that most influenced Western public discourse since the Second World War.\n\nSnow's Rede Lecture condemned the British educational system as having, since the Victorian era, over-rewarded the humanities (especially Latin and Greek) at the expense of scientific and engineering education, despite such achievements having been so decisive in winning the Second World War for the Allies. This in practice deprived British elites (in politics, administration, and industry) of adequate preparation to manage the modern scientific world. By contrast, Snow said, German and American schools sought to prepare their citizens equally in the sciences and humanities, and better scientific teaching enabled these countries' rulers to compete more effectively in a scientific age. Later discussion of \"The Two Cultures\" tended to obscure Snow's initial focus on differences between British systems (of both schooling and social class) and those of competing countries.\n\nThe literary critic F. R. Leavis called Snow a \"public relations man\" for the scientific establishment in his essay \"Two Cultures?: The Significance of C. P. Snow\", published in \"The Spectator\". The article attracted a great deal of negative correspondence in the magazine's letters pages.\n\nIn his 1963 book Snow appeared to revise his thinking and was more optimistic about the potential of a mediating third culture. This concept was later picked up in . Introducing the reprinted , Stefan Collini has argued that the passage of time has done much to reduce the cultural divide Snow noticed, but has not removed it entirely.\n\nStephen Jay Gould's \"The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox\" provides a different perspective. Assuming the dialectical interpretation, it argues that Snow's concept of \"two cultures\" is not only off the mark, it is a damaging and short-sighted viewpoint, and that it has perhaps led to decades of unnecessary fence-building.\n\nSimon Critchley, in \"Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction\" suggests:\nThat is, Critchley argues that what Snow said represents a resurfacing of a discussion current in the mid-nineteenth century. Critchley describes the Leavis contribution to the making of a controversy as \"a vicious \"ad hominem\" attack\"; going on to describe the debate as \"a familiar clash in English cultural history\" citing also T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold.\n\nIn his opening address at the Munich Security Conference in January 2014, the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves said that the current problems related to security and freedom in cyberspace are the culmination of absence of dialogue between \"the two cultures\": \"Today, bereft of understanding of fundamental issues and writings in the development of liberal democracy, computer geeks devise ever better ways to track people... simply because they can and it's cool. Humanists on the other hand do not understand the underlying technology and are convinced, for example, that tracking meta-data means the government reads their emails.\"\n\nContrasting scientific and humanistic knowledge is a repetition of the \"Methodenstreit\" of 1890 German universities. A quarrel in 1911 between Benedetto Croce and Giovanni Gentile on the one hand and Federigo Enriques on the other one is believed to have had enduring effects in the separation of the two cultures in Italy and to the predominance of the views of (objective) idealism over those of (logical) positivism. In the social sciences it is also commonly proposed as the quarrel of positivism versus interpretivism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31880880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31880880", "title": "Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology", "text": "Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology\n\nThe theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology are the general and specific scientific theories that explain the ultimate origins of psychological traits in terms of evolution. These theories originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, or EEA. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating. For male mammals, which have a relatively fast reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively slow reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, but he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of self-sacrificing behavior. Group selection is a weak explanation because in any group the less self-sacrificing animals will be more likely to survive and the group will become less self-sacrificing.\n\nIn 1964, William D. Hamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory, emphasizing a \"gene's-eye\" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation by helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. According to \"Hamilton's rule\", a self-sacrificing behavior can evolve if it helps close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how \"altruism\" evolved. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including evolutionary game theory, tit-for-tat reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories not only help explain the development of altruistic behavior but also account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).\n\nSeveral mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the Baldwin effect).\n\nCritics of evolutionary psychology have sometimes challenged its theoretical underpinnings, saying that humans never developed powerful social instincts through natural selection and that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychologists are merely just-so-stories.\n\nEvolutionary psychology primarily uses the theories of natural selection, sexual selection, and inclusive fitness to explain the evolution of psychological adaptations.\n\nEvolutionary psychology is sometimes seen not simply as a subdiscipline of psychology but as a metatheoretical framework in which \"the entire field of psychology can be examined.\"\n\nEvolutionary psychologists consider Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection to be important to an understanding of psychology. Natural selection occurs because individual organisms who are genetically better suited to the current environment leave more descendants, and their genes spread through the population, thus explaining why organisms fit their environments so closely. This process is slow and cumulative, with new traits layered over older traits. The advantages created by natural selection are known as adaptations. Evolutionary psychologists say that animals, just as they evolve physical adaptations, evolve psychological adaptations.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists emphasize that natural selection mostly generates specialized adaptations, which are more efficient than general adaptations. They point out that natural selection operates slowly, and that adaptations are sometimes out of date when the environment changes rapidly. In the case of humans, evolutionary psychologists say that much of human nature was shaped during the stone age and may not match the contemporary environment.\n\nSexual selection favors traits that provide mating advantages, such as the peacock's tail, even if these same traits are usually hindrances. Evolutionary psychologists point out that, unlike natural selection, sexual selection typically leads to the evolution of sex differences. Sex differences typically make reproduction faster for one sex and slower for the other, in which case mates are relatively scarce for the faster sex. Sexual selection favors traits that increase the number of mates for the fast sex and the quality of mates for the slow sex. For mammals, the female has the slower reproduction rate. Males typically evolve either traits to help them fight other males or traits to impress females. Females typically evolve greater abilities to discern the qualities of males, such as choosiness in mating.\n\nInclusive fitness theory, proposed by William D. Hamilton, emphasized a \"gene's-eye\" view of evolution. Hamilton noted that what evolution ultimately selects are genes, not groups or species. From this perspective, individuals can increase the replication of their genes into the next generation not only directly via reproduction, by also indirectly helping close relatives with whom they share genes survive and reproduce. General evolutionary theory, in its modern form, \"is\" essentially inclusive fitness theory.\n\nInclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how \"altruism\" evolved. The dominant, pre-Hamiltonian view was that altruism evolved via group selection: the notion that altruism evolved for the benefit of the group. The problem with this was that if one organism in a group incurred any fitness costs on itself for the benefit of others in the group, (i.e. acted \"altruistically\"), then that organism would reduce its own ability to survive and/or reproduce, therefore reducing its chances of passing on its altruistic traits.\n\nFurthermore, the organism that benefited from that altruistic act and only acted on behalf of its own fitness would increase its own chance of survival and/or reproduction, thus increasing its chances of passing on its \"selfish\" traits.\nInclusive fitness resolved \"the problem of altruism\" by demonstrating that altruism can evolve via kin selection as expressed in Hamilton's rule:\ncost < relatedness × benefit\nIn other words, altruism can evolve as long as the fitness \"cost\" of the altruistic act on the part of the actor is less than the \"degree of genetic relatedness\" of the recipient times the fitness \"benefit\" to that recipient.\nThis perspective reflects what is referred to as the gene-centered view of evolution and demonstrates that group selection is a very weak selective force.\n\nMiddle-level evolutionary theories are consistent with general evolutionary theory, but focus on certain domains of functioning (Buss, 2011) Specific evolutionary psychology hypotheses may be derivative from a mid-level theory (Buss, 2011). Three very important middle-level evolutionary theories were contributed by Robert Trivers as well as Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson\n\n"}

{"id": "58590455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58590455", "title": "Values (Western philosophy)", "text": "Values (Western philosophy)\n\nThe values that a person holds may be personal or political depending on whether they are considered in relation to the individual or to society. Apart from moral virtue, examples of personal values include friendship, knowledge, beauty etc. and examples of political values, justice, equality and liberty. This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is. Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal.\n\nIt is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right. A new field of enquiry called “axiology” (from the Greek \"axios\" meaning “worth”), defined as “the philosophical study of goodness or value”, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term “value” into fields other than traditional ethics. R.H.Lotze, F.Brentano and G.E.Moore have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between intrinsic and instrumental value, that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value. \n\nExamples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder’s \"Value Theory\", Elinor Mason’s \"Value Pluralism\" and Michael Zimmerman’s \"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value\". Schroeder defines axiology as being “primarily concerned with classifying what things are good”, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called “monist”, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called “pluralist”, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the Utilitarians, such as Jeremy Bentham, who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. Immanuel Kant, too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will. Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book \"The Nature of Intrinsic Value\" (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value: \n\nBrentano (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, Virtue \n\nMoore (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, Virtue\n\nRoss (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activity\n\nIn particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of William Frankena who, in his book \"Ethics\" (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together. It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups:\n\n1. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience\n\n2. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment\n\n3. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem\n\n4. Life, health, strength, peace, security\n\n5. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation\n\n6. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty\n\nFrankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the “classical triad” of beauty, goodness and truth and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows.\n\nFrankena in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between “harmony and proportion in objects contemplated” and “harmony and proportion in one’s own life”. He refers to Plato who, firstly, in the \"Philebus\" suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the “beauty of colour and form”, and secondly in the \"Republic\" that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the “good life” which itself should contain “form”, “variety” and “balance”. \n\nAnother distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself. James Shelley in his article \"The Concept of the Aesthetic\" notes that the term \"aesthetic\" in deriving from the Greek \"aesthesis\", which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation; George Dickie in his book \"Art and the Aesthetic\" charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory; and Zimmerman refers to G.E.Moore who wrote in relation to art and beauty that “by far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness”. Both Frankena and Nicolai Hartmann, who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to Nietzsche who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an “affirmation of existence”.\n\nShelley describes another concept apart from “immediacy” or “focussing one’s attention on the subject” and this is the concept of “disinterestedness\", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially. He refers to Schopenhauer who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: “One thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier”, wrote Schopenhauer, a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless. Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer “drama or comicality”, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of “non-exhibited properties”, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an “art-historical context” where only knowledge of, in Danto’s terminology, an “artworld” can facilitate our feeling “the proper sentiments”.\n\nIn addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. G.E.Moore wrote that it is neither in the “beautiful object” nor in the “conscious perception” where value is found but in the relationship between the two. Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where “a value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.”\n\nThe second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of ethics. Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is pleasure or virtue that will lead to happiness. Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple goods – people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to Aristotle who said that value resides in “the proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature” and that it is the “active exercising of man’s faculties that give rise to pleasure”. \n\nRegarding virtue, Elinor Mason refers to J.S.Mill who made the distinction between lower values and higher values. The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of cause and effect whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it. If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this. Mason refers to G.E.Moore who, whilst recognising the virtues of “industry and temperance”, recognised that there exists a “plurality of bearers of value”. Love, beauty and friendship are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to pleasure or happiness. \n\nAnother significant writer on value, mentioned by both Frankena and Zimmerman, is John Dewey who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an “ongoing stream” of cause and effect, which he called the “continuum of means and ends”, where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like Aristotle, that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants. These needs arise from a constant “interaction between a human being and his environment” and Dewey introduced the notion of having a “framework” of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.\n\nThe third of the classical values - truth – is listed by Frankena alongside knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Given that “truth may never be fully known” he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. Jesse Prinz in \"Culture and Cognitive Science\" took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge. This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of honour, esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by Hartmann who realised that the terms “truth” and “truthfulness” involved two different, although related, kinds of value. Whilst truth is associated with the values of knowledge and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and integrity.\n\nIn his article, Prinz defines culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one’s parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentioned and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place, and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters. \n\nKnowledge of both culture and subculture is important in understanding people’s values. Jacobson in an article on fitting attitudes tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to Brentano who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting. Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from “the point of view of the universe” where integrating one’s set of values with the principles of some higher truth (“selective copying” is the example he gives) may result in instances of non-conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society. The concept of “fittingness” introduces the value of integrity which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article \"Integrity\" [2001]. The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one’s life – aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. – and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where Aristotle could write “with a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash”, to more general approaches regarding meaning and identity, or “wisdom and self-knowledge”. \n\nThe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the “classical” or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like Moore and Brentano. A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and Hartmann and owe as much to the thoughts of Kant and Schopenhauer as they do to Christianity. The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values – what Plato called the “goods of the body” – such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena. \n\nSome early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. R.B.Perry, referred to by Frankena, and whose work \"The General Theory of Value\" [1926] was called “the magnum opus of the new approach” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics; An earlier work, \"Lebensformen\" [1914], by the psychologist, Eduard Spranger, set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political; and Gordon Allport, who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in Peterson and Seligman’s \"Character Strengths and Virtues\" [2004] , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their \"Study of Values\" [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values: \n\nPersonality\n\nValues\nThese early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed recently by C.B.Miller in his article entitled \"Empirical Approaches to Moral Character\" and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman. Their classification of values, \"Values in Action\" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six-fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage. Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories.\n\nRegarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the “sentimental” or “emotivist” tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy. Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important. A.M.Taylor in her paper, \"Investigation into Facts and Values\" [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or “wholistic” understanding. The older values taken from the “aesthetic, moral and scientific spheres” were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as “creativity, feeling and innovation”. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being “pride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome”. He mentioned David Hume in this respect who had used the three headings of “Pride and Humility”, “Love and Hatred” and “Will and the Direct Passions” in the second volume of his \"Treatise of Human Nature\" and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order.\n\nFrankena’s list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows Hartmann. “Material goods” were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,\"The Realm of Ethical Values\" [1926] in relation to wealth and economics. Frankena mentions Plato who had referred to wealth, health and strength as “goods of the body”. Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of “money, cars and other material possessions”, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of “things that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it”. Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being “pride-worthy” and he mentioned David Hume who had noted that people take pride in, such “external advantages as… country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes”. Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of Aristotle who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and “not to neglect” what belongs to them. \n\nHealth on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. Frankena, for example, wrote that we desire health “for its own sake”, and Zimmerman wrote that “Being healthy is just a good way to be”. The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of “just being” have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of Becoming. Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to Immanuel Kant one of whose principal values lay in duty, particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the “basic stuff” through physical exercise and maintenance. Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in “medicine, bathing and exercise” but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any “natural talents and gifts of fortune” that a person might possess. James Griffin in his book on \"Well-Being\" [1986] similarly introduced the value of “accomplishment” and how, in Aristotle’s terminology, we might grow and “flourish” in other ways. \n\nTo the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in Frankena's words, “love, friendship, mutual affection and cooperation”; G.E.Moore added “love” to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge; and Jacobson added “friendship” to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge. Moore, in reflecting Christianity’s emphasis on the importance of love, suggested that “… the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know… more complicated than beauty… more complicated than knowledge”. Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned Plato, who had outlined various kinds of love in the \"Symposium\", and who had described \"sympatheia\" or coaffection , as “filling men with affection… kindness… friendship… forgiveness”. For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the “community of feeling among mankind”. Jacobson referred to David Hume who similarly linked love with sympathy, the latter feeling arising from “the great resemblance among human creatures”. \n\nOn a more practical level, Bernard Gert in his work on \"The Definition of Morality\" [2002] introduced the notion of “loyalty” as a factor in establishing a sense of community among family and kinship groups. Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned Kant who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other. Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence. Kant had defined friendship as “the coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner”. He also introduced the concept of “respect” by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community, and he talked of community itself in terms of “being able to communicate… to perfect social intercourse… and to cultivate a disposition of… reciprocity… agreeableness… courtesy… hospitality”. \n\nCommunication was introduced as a separate value by Perry; and Hartmann, after working through the primary values, introduced a “second group” which included not only “brotherly love” but also “social intercourse”. Frankena introduced Aquinas who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that “there are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved”. Gert too realised that there was value in “interpersonal interaction” but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island. Frankena answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.\n\nTowards the end of his list, Frankena included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty. Regarding freedom, he introduced Schopenhauer who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the “primal will”, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and spiritual contemplation. Strength and freedom of the will were values for Hartmann too, and also for Kant who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal “sensuous impulses”. These latter included emotions such as desire, fear, hope and anger, whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object. Griffin distinguished between desire itself and “informed desire”, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will. Attitudes can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and “corrected”, according to Brentano, through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate. \n\nFrankena recorded that his list included “all the things that Hartmann mentions”, but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called “spiritual goods” such as “love of the remote” and, in a Nietzschian phrase, “radiant virtue”. Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in \"Plural and Conflicting Values\" [1990] suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the “contemplation” of God or of what is good: “He who proceeds aright”, said Plato, “should begin in youth to visit beautiful places… to contemplate the vast sea… until on that shore he grows and waxes strong”. In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills, and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the sublimity that they might afford. Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that A.N.Whitehead had introduced, but it was Ralph Waldo Emerson in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself. Hartmann suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring, and he mentioned Nietzsche who wrote regarding art: “What does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values… It is the great stimulus of life”. Alternatively it might be humour that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.\n\nVarious theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value “is” – as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may “have”. There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of ethics. Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say, the principles governing the conduct of a person then the first group of theories (ontology and deontology) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories (teleology and consequentialism) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories (virtue ethics and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes.\n\nOntology (from the Greek \"Ontos\" meaning “being” or “that which is”) is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the “ontological categories” or plain categories of being. Zimmerman mentions G.E.Moore who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: “If we recognise that anything whatever may be good… we start with a much more open mind”. Zimmerman introduced the concept of “supervenience” through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying categories of being themselves. Kant is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also Christine Korsgaard who, drawing on Kant’s distinction between things-in-themselves and the relation between things, draws a similar distinction between intrinsic values (values in virtue of “non-relational properties”) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of “relational properties”). Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore’s words, that goodness “just is”, or in Zimmerman’s words that pleasure “just is”. This has led to some, like Monroe Beardsley, to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist. Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant’s three categories of relation, namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively. \n\nDeontology, on the other hand, (from the Greek \"Deon\" meaning “duty”) is the branch of ethics that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what \"ought\" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an “is” to an “ought” (the “Is-ought problem\") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by David Hume. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value. Given that “a small number of core moral values are espoused universally” the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not “conflict”. Frankena suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction. Kant’s categorical imperative is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of logical necessity, i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of logical sufficiency which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether “aesthetic, prudential or logical”.\n\nMark Schroeder in his article on \"Value Theory\" considers consequentialism to be “under the umbrella” of teleology, where the latter can be defined as that branch of metaphysics which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek \"Telos\" meaning “the end or purpose of an action”). According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of cause and effect. Frankena defined instrumental value as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to Aristotle who, besides defining different kinds of cause, defined the good as “that at which all things aim”. If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of egoism and consequentialism respectively. Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which “all the consequences taken as a whole are good”. \n\nRegarding the end at which people aim, Bentham, according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of “pleasure”, and that all other values such as beauty, friendship, knowledge etc could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford. John Stuart Mill suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like Plato, whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim. Mason also refers to James Griffin who was of the opinion that “well-being” was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of “flourishing” or a “maximisation of life” in all its aspects. A “balancing of elements” is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered “in various combinations” in order to afford a “framework” or a “plan of life” for ourselves. This way of thinking was called by Elizabeth Anderson, in her article on John Dewey, “objective list theory” as opposed to theories like Bentham’s based on pleasure or those of Dewey based on “informed desire”. Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the “value of means and ends are reciprocally determined”. According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more “pragmatic” approach saying that only through “calm, informed reflection” on the ways in which people “interact with the environment” and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.\n\nMason in her article on \"Value Pluralism\" introduces virtue ethics as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should “be” rather than what a person should “do”. Frankena had similarly introduced an “ethics of virtue” as a third approach (following deontology and consequentialism), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our disposition, attitudes and emotions. Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways. Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on \"Virtue Ethics\", asking questions like “how many virtues are there” and “how do they relate to each other”. C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on moral character points to recent work which suggests that the categories used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six “core virtues” listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their “Values in Action” or VAI. \n\nOne of the similarities between virtue theory and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent. They are “agent-centred” rather than “act-centred” theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. Roderick Chisholm in his book, \"Brentano and Intrinsic Value\" [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in virtue but in “individuals acting virtuously” or not just in pleasure but in “individuals experiencing pleasure”. However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on \"Fitting-Attitude Theory\" suggests that there is a reciprocity between “facts about human nature” and “facts about the object”, and that “to be valuable” requires either that one’s “feelings are adequate to the object”, or that “the object is “fitting” in respect of some particular attitude. The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of humour and good taste, or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both Mason and Zimmerman discuss the problem of conflicting values, as did Philippa Foot who, in the field of virtue ethics, suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying “that even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted\" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.\n"}
{"id": "40655294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40655294", "title": "Violent extremism", "text": "Violent extremism\n\nViolent extremism refers to the beliefs and actions of people who support or use ideologically motivated violence to achieve radical ideological, religious or political views. Violent extremist views can be exhibited along a range of issues, including politics, religion and gender relations. No society, religious community or worldview is immune to violent extremism. Though “radicalization” is a contested term to some, it has come to be used to define the process through which an individual or a group considers violence as a legitimate and a desirable means of action. Radical thought that does not condone the exercise of violence to further political goals may be seen as normal and acceptable, and be promoted by groups working within the boundaries of the law. It is often used as a code name for Islamic terrorism.\n\nIn the American military domain, the term \"violent extremist organizations\" or VEO is now used. The Obama administration defines VEO as groups of \"individuals who support or commit ideologically motivated violence to further political goals\". These groups include both ideologically-motivated international terrorist organizations (ITO) and homegrown violent extremists (HVE).\n\nThere is no single profile or pathway for radicalization, or even speed at which it happens. Nor does the level of education seem to be a reliable predictor of vulnerability to radicalization. It is however established that there are socio-economic, psychological and institutional factors that lead to violent extremism. Specialists group these factors into three main categories, push factors, pull factors and contextual factors.\n\n“Push Factors” drive individuals to violent extremism, such as: marginalization, inequality, discrimination, persecution or the perception thereof; limited access to quality and relevant education; the denial of rights and civil liberties; and other environmental, historical and socio-economic grievances.\n\n“Pull Factors” nurture the appeal of violent extremism, for example: the existence of well-organized violent extremist groups with compelling discourses and effective programmes that are providing services, revenue and/or employment in exchange for membership. Groups can also lure new members by providing outlets for grievances and promise of adventure and freedom. Furthermore, these groups appear to offer spiritual comfort, “a place to belong” and a supportive social network.\n\nContextual factors that provide a favourable terrain to the emergence of violent extremist groups, such as: fragile states, the lack of rule of law, corruption and criminality.\n\nThe following behaviours in combination have been identified as signs of potential radicalization:\n\nThe role of education in preventing violent extremism and de-radicalizing young people has only recently gained global acceptance. An important step in this direction was the launch, in December 2015, of the UN Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism which recognizes the importance of quality education to address the drivers of this phenomenon.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council also emphasized this point in its Resolutions 2178 and 2250, which notably highlights the need for “quality education for peace that equips youth with the ability to engage constructively in civic structures and inclusive political processes” and called on “ all relevant actors to consider instituting mechanisms to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue that involve youth and discourage their participation in acts of violence, terrorism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination.”\n\nEducation has been identified as preventing radicalisation through:\n\nUNESCO has emphasised Global Citizenship Education (GCED) as an emerging approach to education that focuses on developing learners’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in view of their active participation in the peaceful and sustainable development of their societies. GCED aims to instill respect for human rights, social justice, gender equality and environmental sustainability, which are fundamental values that help raise the defences of peace against violent extremism.\n\nThe Sabaoon Project, initiated by the Pakistan Army and run by the Social Welfare Academics and Training organization (SWAaT) since 2009, has been implemented to deradicalize and rehabilitate former militant youth who were involved in violent extremist activities and apprehended by the army in Swat and the surrounding areas in Pakistan. Based on an individualized approach and intervention, the project follows a three-step model (see image).\n\nTo tackle the issue of violent extremism and radicalization in schools, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Kenya launched a new national strategy targeting youth in 2014, entitled Initiatives to Address Radicalization of the Youth in Educational Institutions in the Republic of Kenya. The Strategy adopted measures that service the students’ interests and well-being. For example, it includes efforts to create child-friendly school environments and encourages students to participate in “talent academies” to pursue an area of their own interest.\n\nThe Strategy also includes the discontinuation of ranking schools based on academic performance. This was to lessen the overemphasis on examinations and to reduce student pressure, incorporating other indicators of student achievement, such as abilities in sport and artistic talent. The purpose is to reduce the stress of students’ lives at home and in school that may be vented through escape tactics, including joining outlawed groups. The Strategy also employs other effective means to prevent violent extremism, including the integration of Preventing of Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) in curricula and school programmes; adopting a multi- sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach; encouraging student participation through student governance processes and peer-to-peer education; and the involvement of media as a stakeholder.\n\nWhile it is being increasingly reported that women play an active role in violent extremist organizations and attacks as assailants and supporters, men are still more often the perpetrators of violent extremist acts and therefore the targets of recruitment campaigns.\n\n"}
