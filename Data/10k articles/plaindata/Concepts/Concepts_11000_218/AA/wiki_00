{"id": "34080397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34080397", "title": "\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial in Russia", "text": "\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial in Russia\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita As It Is trial in Russia was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book, \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" (1968), a translation and commentary of the Hindu holy text, \"Bhagavad Gita\", on charges of religious extremism. It contains a translation and commentary by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.\n\nThe trial was initiated in June 2011 in Tomsk, Russia, based on an assessment of the book by scholars of Tomsk State University, which concluded that Prabhupada's translations and commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as \"patently absurd\" undertaking of \"ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals\". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President Dmitry Medvedev and Premier Vladimir Putin for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for India-Russia relations and for Russia's international reputation.\n\nIn December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial was included in the 2011 annual International Religious Freedom Report of the U.S. Department of State among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.\n\n\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" is a Russian version of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) founder A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's translation and commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\", a revered scripture for nearly one billion Hindus. The book, a central scripture for Hare Krishna followers, was first published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1968 and has been translated into 80 languages, with over 100 million copies distributed globally till date. According to scholars, the book has never been accused of fomenting extremism before. According to ISKCON, in 2004 and 2005 Moscow state prosecutors found no extremism in the previous edition \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", which had only slight stylistic differences from the one on trial.\n\n\"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" was presented to a number of world leaders, including the British Prime Minister David Cameron, who said that he \"keeps a copy of the book in his office.\" Indian Ambassador to Russia Ajay Malhotra said that Prabhupada's translation of the Gita \"is one of the best that you can find, because he gives you the words, the meanings and the options to understand it as it was written\". In November 2011, President of India Pratibha Patil in a message to ISKCON Russia for its 40th anniversary commended the organization for \"an important role in popularising the noble and eternal message of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita and promoting spiritual harmony in many foreign lands\".\n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" trial follows prohibition of a number of publications by groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology.\n\nThe court case was filed in June 2011 by the public prosecutor of Tomsk Victor Fyodotov. The prosecutor based his plea on an expert analysis of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" commissioned by the FSB. Its authors, three professors of Tomsk State University, Sergei Avanesov, Valery Svistunov, and Valery Naumov, concluded that Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" contain \"signs of fomenting religious hatred, denigration of human dignity on grounds of gender, race, nationality, language, origins, and religious conviction\", claim exclusiveness of the Krishna religion, use derogatory terms against those who were not devotees of Krishna, and foster \"social discord\", \"gender, race, nationality, and language\" discrimination. In addition to this, it was alleged to contain \"calls to hostile, violent actions against a number of social and religious groups\".\n\nThe prosecutor thus charged the book as being in violation of the Federal law № 114-ФЗ (\"On countering extremist activities\") and petitioned the court to include \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" in the Federal List of Extremist Materials, which would ban its printing, possession, and distribution. The Federal List contains over 1,000 works, Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\" among them, considered as fomenting ethnic, social, and religious hatred.\n\nIn the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official. According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by Federal Security officer Dmitry Velikotsky. They also stated that the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" did not contain any extremist statements. Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the Bible, like: \"Don't throw pearls before swine\". The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.\n\nThe judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of Kemerovo State University, including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov. They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not. Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.\n\nOn December 28, 2011, Federal Judge Galina Butenko rejected the prosecutor's plea for a ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\". The court's resolution stated that the main criterion for classifying any text as an extremist one is the presence of calls for extremist actions and justifications for such actions, and that the propaganda of exclusiveness found in the book and criticism of political, ideological, and religious convictions is not sufficient grounds for classifying it as such.\n\nThe decision received wide coverage by the international media.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office appealed the court's refusal to declare the Russian \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" an extremist text in a superior court, insisting that the book should be banned, and asking for more time.\n\nThe prosecutors insisted that the Russian translation of the book be banned as \"extremist literature.\" The appeal quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich questioning the translated version, the authenticity of its linguistics as they relate to Hindu scripture, and \"semantic distortions.\"\n\nThe prosecutor general for Tomsk Vasily Voikin said, \"When we have to deal with such materials, we are just bound to proceed with them. The law opposes extremism. When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, we just have to respond\". The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012 but was later rescheduled for March 20.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, \"it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason.\" Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, \"That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court\".\n\nOn February 21, 2012, at a press conference at the Interfax office in Tomsk, anti-cult activist Alexander Dvorkin stated that the \"manifesto book of the Krishna Consciousness Society, \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", is not immediately related to the original, being a free and not quite skilled translation.\"\n\nIn response to the appeal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), along with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), stated that they would fight \"internationally\" against any threats to ban the Bhagavad Gita in Russia.\n\nRepresentative of the prosecution said that the district court incorrectly interpreted the definition of \"extremism\" when it claimed that it is necessary for it to contain calls to extremist activity which must be expressed in any kind of actions, pointing out that the law prohibits all propaganda that incites any kind of hatred.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, the appeal court upheld the decision of the lower court, rejecting the prosecutor's petition. On May 29, 2012, Tomsk regional prosecutor Vasily Voykin said that the prosecutor's office will no further appeal the court's refusal to declare \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" extremist.\n\nSince December 17, 2011, when \"Indo-Asian News Service\" (IANS) issued a report by a staff writer Nallan Chakravarthi Bipindra (NC Bipindra) from Moscow about the proposed \"Bhagavad Gita\" ban in Russia, the event became breaking news in the Indian printed and electronic media, with over 600 publications, including editorials, in all major newspapers and TV news channels as of December 27, 2011.\n\nOn December 19, 2011, Bhartruhari Mahtab, leader of the Biju Janata Dal party, raised up the issue of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial in the Indian Parliament (Lok Sabha), demanding to know what the Indian government was undertaking to protect \"the religious rights of Hindus in Russia\". He also called on the government to \"impress [this] upon the Russian authorities through diplomatic channels\". The House Speaker Meira Kumar then turned down requests for speeches on the topic and had to adjourn the session amid protests against the ban of the \"Gita\" sparked by Mahtab's statement, as angry members of the Parliament across the party lines strongly condemned the ban, shouting: \"We will not tolerate an insult to Lord Krishna!\" The issue was simultaneously raised in Rajya Sabha (the Upper House). This display of political unity surprised the media and prompted a Rajya Sabha member to call the December 19 parliamentary session \"a golden day in our history when all differences were deleted to express solidarity for Gita, the book of India\".\n\nOn December 20, Sushma Swaraj, leader of the largest opposition party BJP demanded that the Indian government declare the \"Bhagavad Gita\" a \"national book\". Her move seconded by a BJP member of Rajya Sabha, Tarun Vijay, who asked rhetorically \"Can sun be banned, Himalayas be banned ...?\" Members across party lines voiced their support. Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha K. Rahman Khan, member of the Indian National Congress, said \"the entire house agrees with this and joins in condemning this\".\n\nOn December 21, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation led by the party's foreign affairs chief Vijay Jolly met with the Deputy Chief of the Russian Mission in Delhi Denis Alipov to express the party's \"pain and anguish\" at the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial and demand that \"suitable measures\" be taken by the Russian government to immediately dismiss the court case as baseless. Jolly also expressed surprise that the Russian government allowed the trial to continue for over half a year despite the fact that \"India–Russia relations is of paramount importance to both countries\". The delegation also sent through the Russian embassy a copy of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" to President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev along with a letter, in which the BJP delegation stressed to the Russian President that the Gita is a book of \"sublime thoughts\" that \"preaches self discipline ... promotes spiritualism and teaches to the mankind the need to fulfill responsibility towards worldly duties\".\n\nAccording to officials of the Prime Minister of India's office, \"[t]his matter is receiving the highest attention and the Indian embassy officials in Moscow have been instructed to follow up the case with the Russian authorities\", in order to either have the case withdrawn by the state or resolved. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla said that the Indian authorities are \"apprising the Russian government\" on the issue. However, members of the Parliament accused the Indian government of inaction. They said that on November 1, ISKCON informed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's principal secretary Pulok Chatterji of the impending court case, urging the government to use \"some high-level ministerial visits\" to Moscow, prior to the Prime Minister's own visit December 15–17, to protect the scripture from legal action. The letter, written by ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner Gopala Krishna Goswami, cited the assessment as stating that \"Krishna is evil and not compatible with Christian views\". Despite the advance notice, which was also sent to the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma, and the External Affairs Minister S. M. Krishna, the issue was not discussed with the Russian government during the following six official visits of Indian ministers and top officials to Moscow. Officials who were part of the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister confirmed receipt of the letter to the Indo-Asian News Service.\n\nFollowing the Parliament's demand for a report from the External Affairs Ministry on the issue, Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna said that ISKCON had been advised to take legal recourse and put the controversy in the light of Russia-India relations. He also stated in Lok Sabha that \"the Bhagavad-gita is the definitive treatise of Indian thought.\"\n\nOn December 21, the High Court of Mumbai questioned the Indian government as to the measures it is undertaking to intervene in the possible ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and directed the government to consider representing the position of India on the issue before the court in Tomsk. The High Court decision came in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by two local activists charging the Indian government with inaction in regard to informing the Russian court of the actual purport of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and that the Indian Embassy's \"monitoring the matter closely\" was not sufficient. The court observed Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna's Parliament statement does not imply if Indian government's direct involvement with the December 28 \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial hearing and asked the government to submit its reply on the steps taken by January 9.\n\nOn December 19, dozens of ISKCON followers organized a rally in front of the Russian Consulate in Kolkata, holding up copies of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" in various languages and demanding to stop persecution of their most important scripture. Similar protest marches were held in New Delhi and Chandigarh. Gopal Krishna Goswami, ISKCON's Governing Body Commissioner for India, said that ISKCON members are poised to intensify their public protests across the globe if their scripture is banned. He said, \"I hope the Indian government will be able to pressurize the Russian government and the matter gets solved legally. It's a book of peace and there's nothing extreme in it. Holy scriptures shouldn't be taken to court\".\n\nOn December 21, a highly respected Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband issued a statement signed by its vice-chancellor Abul Qasim Nomani in defense of the \"Bhagavad Gita\", in which he condemned \"Russian diktat against the Hindu holy scripture\". Nomani also called accusations of the Gita of extremism \"totally baseless and highly objectionable\", maintaining that the proposed ban is tantamount to violation of the freedom of conscience \"enshrined\" in the Indian Constitution, and called on boldly countering the \"Russian highhandedness\".\nMaulana Khalid Rashid, head of Firangi Mahal, another Islamic center of higher education in Lucknow, also condemned what he called \"Russian arrogance\" and called on Muslims to support Hindu followers while appealing to the Indian government \"to take a firm stance so that such blasphemous interference is not attempted in future\".\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Isai Mahasangh organization representing Christians in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh addressed the President of India Pratibha Patil and the Pope Benedict XVI, asking for their intervention in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial. An Isai Mahasangh delegation conveyed their memorandum to the President through Madhya Pradesh governor Ram Naresh Yadav, and to the Pope through the Holy See embassy in New Delhi. Jerry Paul, General Secretary of Isai Mahasangh, stated that it was clear from the court case against the Gita that \"the Russians are not aware of the importance of the Gita, the teachings and values it upholds and above all its place in the life of millions of Indians\".\n\nA prominent Hindu teacher Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in his Twitter called the proposed ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" in Russia \"an unpardonable loss for the people of Russia\" and, countering accusations of the book of \"extremism\" and \"intolerance\" opined that it was the move to ban the scripture that showed intolerance and bred terrorism rather than the Gita's teachings.\n\nOn December 20, 2011, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) threatened to protest outside Russian missions in India if Russia effects the ban. VHP General Secretary Pravin Togadia said in a statement that the \"Bhagavad Gita\" is held sacred by all Hindus and that its principles have universal appeal and \"touch humanity so very deeply\", citing Albert Einstein's fascination with the book as an example. Togadia also warned Russian authorities that Indians will be forced to boycott Russian goods, plants, and offices in India in response to the Gita ban in Russia. A group of VHP members held a protest march in front of the Russian consulate in Mumbai. VHP and Bajrang Dal activists also staged protest in Chandigarh, calling on the Indian government to protect the rights of Hindus in Russia and denouncing the proposed ban. On December 23, dozens of activists of Rashtrawadi Sena, a hardline Hindu group, burned a Russian flag and shouted anti-Russian slogans during a protest march in New Delhi over the proposed ban. Rashtrawadi Sena president Jai Bhagwan Goyal called the \"Gita\" \"the most pious book of the nation\" and said there will be no tolerance for insulting it. The protesters also sent a memorandum to Indian President Pratibha Patil, and to the Russian embassy, demanding to avert the ban. They also urged the President to declare the \"Bhagavad Gita\" a \"national scripture\" in order to prevent such insults in the future. A similar protest along with the burning of a Russian flag was held on December 26 by activists of the right-wing Hindu organisation Shiv Sena in Amritsar. In a similar move, a Jammu unit of Sri Ram Sena appealed to Indian and Russian authorities to forestall the impending \"Gita \" ban \"for the betterment of Indo-Russia relations\".\n\nSanal Edamaruku, the president of the Indian Rationalist Association, opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the Russian Orthodox Church may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the Tarksheel Society, also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.\n\nOn the other hand, Dalit Marxist scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, the Russian community in Goa has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa Vikram Varma stated: \"The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the \"Bhagavad Gita\" trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from all over the world, mostly from India.\n\nThe topic has gone viral on social networks, with the hashtag #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian Twitter. Noted poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar, for instance, twitted: \"Banning Gita ? Have they lost their minds. This great book of wisdom belongs not only to Hindus but to the whole humanity\". Member of Parilament Naveen Jindal wrote in his blog, \"I welcome the statement by the Russian ambassador to India condemning the \"Bhagavad Gita\" controversy\". Janata Dal party leader Subramanian Swamy wrote on Twitter: \"Happy to inform that Russian Ambassador will tell my daughter on TV that he is a student of Gita and Russia will rectify matters soon. Ok?\" and Bollywood celebrity Farah Khan suggested in a retweet: \"The Russians have banned the Gita. In retaliation let's ban something equally sacrosanct to them: vodka\".\n\nProminent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial. \nA vocal anti-fundamentalist Ram Puniyani of the EKTA Committee for Communal Amity called the move to ban the \"Bhagavad Gita\" translation \"irrational\", suggesting that possible questionable passages should be analyzed and debated, but they do not warrant the legal action. Former president of the Students Islamic Movement of India Shahid Badr Falahi said he was \"completely against\" this or any other bans of religious books, calling on \"equal opinion on issues pertaining to every religion\". Ram Madhav, national executive member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh termed the attempted ban \"a shameful act\" planned by some \"fundamentalist groups in Russia\" to portray the Bhagavad Gita as a \"terror manual\". He emphasized the Gita's status as one of the most sacred texts respected in all religions and expressed hope that the Russian government will help stop the trial.\n\nThe Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like \"Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk\". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.\n\nHare Krishna followers, who count over 100,000 members and over 100 centers in Russia, expressed fear that the trial on their main scripture, if upheld by the court, will be followed by a ban of their entire movement and religion nationwide. The 15,000-strong Hindu community in Russia shared the apprehension. On November 1, ISKCON leader in India Gopal Krishna Goswami appealed to the Indian government asking to intervene and resolve the impending trial by bringing it up with the Russian authorities during Indian official visits to Moscow. Hindu followers in Russia from India, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Nepal and other countries held an emergency meeting, at which they set up the Hindu Council of Russia meant to protect their interests in Russia, and elected Sadhu Priya Das, and India-born member of ISKCON, as its chairman. Das said that they were seeking opinion of the Russian Ombudsman and experts from Moscow and St. Petersburg, the main centers of Indology in Russia, and that they trusted the Russian judiciary, hoping that \"finally the truth will prevail\".\n\nISKCON members alleged that the court case was instigated by the Russian Orthodox Church in order to limit their activities in Russia.\n\nIslamic studies scholar Roman Silantyev opined that Prabhupada's interpretation \"has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism\" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.\n\nOn November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper \"Moskovskij Komsomolets\", scientists and members of the Russian Academy of Sciences along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, \"there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations.\"\n\nSergey Serebryanny, the head of the Institute of High Humanitarian Studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the \"Bhagavad Gita\" with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers \"have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation\".\n\nRussian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the \"Bhagavad Gita\", which \"is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live\". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was \"admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy\" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, \"nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia\". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism against Prabhupada's \"copious\" commentaries on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" are fallacious and based on a \"primitive\" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as \"fool,\" \"enemy,\" \"demon, \"kill\"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when \"specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts\". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards \"a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna\", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy book to \"Mein Kampf\", should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, \"people will again start being burned alive\".\n\nHistorian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the \"Gita\" was \"contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation\". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, \"one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature\". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the \"Bhagavad Gita\" Volodin replied that \"all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world\".\n\nIn an interview by \"CNN-IBN\", Russia's ambassador to India Alexander Kadakin called \"Bhagavad Gita\" \"the source of wisdom and inspiration not only for the people of India but for Russia as well and the world.\"\nHe assured that the Russian government is using all means to end the \"Bhagavad Gita\" scandal and added that he thought it \"categorically inadmissible\" to take any sacred scriptures \"for examination to ignorant people\" to the courts rather than to academic forums Kadakin ruled out the possibility of the Russian government directly influencing the court decision, but added that the government still \"can do something\" and called the instigators of the trial \"madmen\", whose \"madness should be stopped.\" He also answered a question of a possible apology to the people of India by the Russian government, opining that since it was not the Russian government who started the case, it \"has nothing to apologize for, [but] can only testify and reiterate the love and affection and highest esteem our nation has for Bhagvat Gita.\"\n\nOn December 27, 2011, after a meeting with the Foreign Minister of India S. M. Krishna, at which Krishna reiterated India's grave concerns over the issue, Kadakin told reporters that the Russian government will do everything within its powers to prevent the ban. He said that, while it was a judicial process, the Russian government can ask the people of Russia \"to express our love and admiration for the Gita, ... that [assurance] you can get from anyone in Russia\". He also added that he had read the Gita and thought it was a great scripture of the world, and maintained that \"no holy scripture, whether it is Bible, Quran or Gita, can be brought to a court\".\n\nAccording to the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajeev Shukla, a top Russian minister also \"expressed regrets\" about the situation.\n\nRussian Chief Director for Human Rights Vladimir Lukin stated that the attempt to ban \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" amounted to \"infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness\" and that it was \"unacceptable\" to ban the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, as he said it was a \"globally respected book\". As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.\n\nAt a December 22, 2011 press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: \"In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The work represents an authorized translation of the original from Sanskrit into English. The book was translated into Russian in 1984. As evident from the materials available, the complaints of law enforcement are not so much about the text of the book itself, whose double translation suffers from semantic distortions, as about the author's comments which were regarded as falling under Article 13 of the Federal Law 'On Counteracting Extremist Activity'.\"\n\nNelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial \"absurd\". Speaking on the \"Echo of Moscow\" radio station, she said, \"This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years.\" She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to \"violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith.\" \n\n\"Associated Press\" reported that the attempt to ban \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" angered Hindus around the world.\n\nThe court case evoked protests by US-based Hindu activists, who called the trial \"an attack on religious freedom and belittling of the entire Hindu community.\" The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) based in Washington, DC expressed \"shock and outrage\" over the attempted ban. Subhag Shukla, HAF managing director, called the move by Russian prosecutors \"indefensible\" and \"a draconian attempt to restrict the religious freedom of Hindus in Russia\".\nShukla added that, \"[b]y promoting a narrow and intolerant agenda that demonizes a sacred scripture revered by more than one billion Hindus worldwide, Russian officials are acting contrary to the principles of a free democratic society\". HAF members conveyed their concerns in an official statement to the Russian embassy in Washington, DC, requesting a follow-up meeting to monitor the situation, and urged the Russian judiciary and government \"to uphold the basic rights of their Hindu citizens\". They also warned that \"Any court ruling or law that would prohibit the Bhagavad Gita or any other Hindu religious literature would be considered a direct attack on the civil liberties of Russia's Hindu community and an affront to Hindus throughout the world\".\n\nIn Kathmandu, Nepal, a consortium of the country's Hindu organizations, Rastriya Dharma Sabha Nepal, condemned the proposed ban, urging the government and the Parliament to support the \"Bhagavad Gita\". Chairman of the Dharma Sabha Madhav Bhattarai also requested the Parliament to discuss the issue and address it with the Russian government and embassy in Nepal. Another protest was expressed by a Nepali Shreemadbhagawat Publicity Service Association (SPSA), which emphasized that rather than being extremist, the \"Gita\" \"guides one for the self-discipline and responsibility to human duties\" and informed of plans to hold rallies against the potential ban.\n\nThe United States Department of State in its annual International Religious Freedom Report for 2011 cited the Bhagavad Gita trial among instances of \"selectively enforced existing legal restrictions on religious freedom\" by the Russian government. The report quoted the Russian Ombudsperson for Human Rights Vladimil Lukin as saying that \"the struggle with terrorism is a struggle with real terrorist planning and creation of groups, not with the interpretation of ancient holy books, of whatever faith\".\n\nOn February 24, 2012, Russian religious scholars and experts held a nationwide conference \"Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society\" at the Tomsk State University. They said they were \"perplexed\" over the Tomsk prosecutor's office's continued attempts to have the \"Bhagavad Gita as It Is\" declared extremist. Chief researcher of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, indologist Irina Glushkova said in an interview with \"RIA Novosti\" that there are various schools of Hinduism \"and each school is based on its own scripture or commentary\", adding that \"from this point of view \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture. It is a fundamental principle of Hinduism and there is no any other Hinduism whoever says it, Dvorkin or the Tomsk prosecutor's office\". She also stated it was \"impermissible\" to subject the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" to a criminal court trial, because \"it is inseparable from the original \"Bhagavad Gita\", both being parts of the same culture\". Philosopher Tatyana Lyubimova, chief researcher of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that most ancient scriptures, including the \"Bhagavad Gita\", were revised or adapted over the years so that modern people could better understand them.\n\nOn March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian philosophers, orientologists, and philologists published an open letter addressing both Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin, with copies sent to Russia's Presecutor General, Ministry of Justice, and Public Chamber, urging the ruling tandem to take the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" court case under their \"personal control\". The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as \"untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism\". They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of Bengali Vaishnavism, \"one of the most popular branches of Hinduism\", and \"did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds\". The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial \"discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations\".\n\nMaxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's Governing Body Commission, said that the commentary to \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" is \"a precise and clear reflection\" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n\n\"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us\", said Ajai Malhotra, Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.\n\n\"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible. This demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other’s cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values\", said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash.\n\nOn April 11, 2012 Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Commissioner of Russia, \"warned against court decisions on \"Bhagavad Gita\" texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations.\" Lukin stated that the \"Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to theologians and historians.\" Lukin noted that \"Winston Churchill once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it.\"\n\nOn December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council Roman Silantyev said that the examination of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\" as extremist was accurate, and that \"it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism.\"\n\nHe also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with \"extremely nasty reputation\" and condemned their charitable food distribution programs saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.\n\nOn January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a \"destructive cult\" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It\". Mufti Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, \n\"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos\". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to \"pay the debt\" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable food distribution by \"delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites\". However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as \"fortunately\" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.\n\nOn January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the \"Bhagavad Gita As It Is\", which they called an \"anti-Russian … disgraceful act\" and \"one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court\".\n\nOn January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is \"misinformed\" and \"exerting pressure\" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because \"there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet\".\n\n\n\n\n\nwiktionary:en:cast pearls before swine\n"}

She served as Political Chairman of the National Woman's Party, and played a key role in putting the NWP in the media spotlight in the months leading up to the ratification of Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She was also active in the Congressional Union for Women's Suffrage. Baker was seen as instrumental in bridging the gap across administrations, from Woodrow Wilson, who was deeply hostile toward the NWP, to Harding, who was seen as more willing to engage the NWP in dialogue, and brought women's participation in party politics to a more acceptable place in the public discourse.\n\nShe was born on July 24, 1871, as Abby Pearce Scott in Louisville, Kentucky, to Robert Nicholson Scott (1838–1887) and Elizabeth Goodale Casey (1844–1912). Her father and grandfather were Army officers.\n\nShe was educated at the Norwood Institute.\n\nShe married Robert Walker Baker (1863–1956) around 1893. The couple had three sons.\n\nBakers was one of Alice Paul’s earliest associates. She helped Alice Paul and Lucy Burns plan their first major event–the March 3, 1913, national suffrage parade on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration.\n\nIn 1914 she served as treasurer of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage.\n\nBaker traveled the country as part of the Congressional Union’s “Suffrage Special” train tour of western states in April–May 1916. Baker was in charge of handling the press for the tour. The support that she helped raise from women in states that had already granted women’s suffrage. On April 29, Baker wrote to \"The Suffragist\" on how the tour was received '[Men] invariably call out, 'Here come the Suffragettes,' but very soon they are saying, 'She's all right,' and 'That's straight lady,' or some such approving phrase...\" The tour culminated in a June 1916 meeting in Chicago to form what was at first called the Woman’s Party of Western Voters, or Woman’s Party, for short (NWP). When the NWP was more formally organized in relation to the CU in March 1917, Baker was elected to the NWP executive committee and served as its press chairman (1917-18) and political chairman (1917; 1919-21).\n\nBaker was among the first demonstrators to picket the White House; she was arrested in September 1917 and sentenced to 60 days in the Occoquan Workhouse. In February–March 1919, she served as publicity manager and speaker for the “Prison Special,” a three-week lecture tour by NWP activists who spoke to packed audiences about their jail experiences in an effort to generate support for the suffrage cause. The other speakers included Lillian Ascough, Harriot Stanton Blatch and Lucy Burns. They spoke publicly, distributed literature, and sold the \"Suffragist\". This tour was credited with arousing interest in federal suffrage among, prospective, voting age women.\n\nWhen the NWP’s patriotism was challenged, she reminded critics that her three sons were fighting in World War I.\n\nBaker maintained an intense travel schedule before and during the campaign season for the 1920 presidential election, shuttling between the campaign headquarters of Warren G. Harding in Ohio and James M. Cox in Tennessee, building close relationships with both candidates. Baker's indefatigable efforts drew a great deal of media attention, and helped to normalize the presence of women in the political sphere in the public imagination.\n\nAfter suffrage was achieved, Baker became a member of the NWP’s Committee on International Relations and the Women’s Consultative Committee of the League of Nations. She also represented the NWP at the League’s 1935 international conferences in Geneva where the issue of equal rights was discussed.\n\nShe died on May 13, 1944, in Washington, DC.\n"}

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law. \n\nBosnia and Herzegovina was one of the first countries in the Balkans to adopt the Freedom of Access to Information Act, at the State level in 2000, and then in 2001 in both of its entities, namely the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. However, according to some experts the law requires changes to address a series of shortcomings that have been identified over the years.\n\nDue to the specific circumstances and the way in which it was created, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, annex IV of Dayton Peace Agreement did not pay much attention to the right to information. The development of freedom of information legislation was initiated with a decision of the High Representative in 1999. The Decision asked the State and the Entities to adopt such a legislation. The consultation process for drafting the law involved the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)’s legal experts and extensive public discussions with citizens and civil society groups. The Act was adopted by the Bosnia and Herzegovina State Government in October 2000, and the Republika Srpska Government in May 2001.\n\nThe laws establish a general right of the public to access the information held by public authorities/organs “to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest”. Therefore, the laws establish a general obligation of making all relevant information public, except for some cases falling under the exceptions defined by the law. Access to public information applies to information held by all public organs (legislative, judiciary, executive and administrative) and regardless of their format (written documents, digital data, audio or video records, etc.) as well as to legal persons owner or controlled by public bodies, such as public enterprises, public schools, universities, state agencies, etc. On the contrary, it does not apply to private organisations, private companies and the commercial sector. The laws entitle every person, regardless of his or her citizenship, nationality, ethnicity, or place of residence, the right to access to public information. Journalists and media outlet do not have more rights compared with other requesters. The prescribed period of time for obtaining the requested information is 15 days from the submission of the request. Under the FOI laws, public authorities are both obliged to provide access to documents and records and to publish the most important information without a request (proactive disclosure). Rules for proactive publication apply to information on institutions’ budget, regular activities and decision-making.\n\nIn line with international standards, access to information laws in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Republika Srpska establish that in some cases public information can be withheld on a legal basis. Specifically, three cases of exceptions are foreseen: first, when there is the possibility that disclosing information can cause a significant damage to legitimate functions of the government (national security, defence, monetary policy issues, prevention of crime, etc.); second, the exceptions can be applied to protect commercial interests; and, third, to protect personal interests and privacy of a third party. The application of these exceptions is not automatic: in effect, in order to reject the application on the basis of the exceptions established in the law, authorities have to make the public interest test, meaning considering whether and how the disclosure of information is harming other protected interests.The public interest test is inspired by the most advanced international standards on the right of access to public information. Compared with similar laws in the Western Balkans, only the laws of Serbia and Croatia prescribe such a test. Exceptions are applied only after a case-by-case analysis of every case and specific circumstances related to each request. Labeling a whole category of information as exemption is forbidden.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina some NGOs contribute to enforce the law on access to public information as well as to monitor its application and collect relevant data through the submission of FOI requests and the start of appeal procedures. This is the case, for instance, of the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), Transparency International (Bosnia and Herzegovina), or the Sarajevo-based Center for Investigative Journalism (CIN).\n\nAccording to a report prepared by the Association of journalists of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the country’s Press Council, the vast majority of Bosnians (around 93%) believe that there are several limitations to the right of access to public information in practice. At the same, public opinion in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely not fully aware of their rights with regard to access to public information.\n\nWhen it comes to the application of the law, problems range from inconsistent interpretation of the law by different public bodies, unwillingness to apply it, to non-harmonisation of FOI laws with other laws.\n\nSpecifically, one of the major deficiency of freedom of information laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the weakness of the provisions concerning the appeal procedures in case the request is rejected. The FOI law of the Republika Srpska does not stipulate an appeal procedure at all. Another problem concerns the lack of compliance with other existing laws that exclude or significantly reduce the right to free access to information in practice both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska. Also, experts have identified among the shortcomings hindering the application of FOI laws in Bosnia and Herzegovina the lack of an effective system for monitoring their application. Only a small number of public bodies comply with the obligation to publish the information on the number of received questions related to freedom of information on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2013-16 in order to test the implementation of FOI laws, the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) submitted a series of requests for accessing documents to different public bodies in the country at all level. Half of BIRN’s requests for information were rejected, while the remaining 50 per cent were only partially granted.\n\nAlso, according to Transparency International - Bosnia and Herzegovina only 40% of public enterprises in Republika Srpska and 27% in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina provides the requested information within the timeframe established by the law. In 37% of cases examined by Transparency International the fulfillment of the procedure lasts more than one month, even if the law stipulates that the information requested must be provided in maximum 15 days.\n\n"}

She participates actively in the field of sexology and has written extensively on the fields of biology of gender, sexual identity, gender identity, and gender roles.\n\nFausto-Sterling received her Bachelor of Arts degree in zoology from University of Wisconsin in 1965 and her Ph.D. in developmental genetics from Brown University in 1970. She has taught at Brown since earning her Ph.D. and is the Nancy Duke Lewis Professor of Biology and Gender Studies in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry there.\n\nShe has written two books intended for the general audience. The second edition of the first of those books, \"Myths of Gender\", was published in 1992.\n\nHer second book for the general public is \"\", published in 2000. She stated that in it she sets out to \"convince readers of the need for theories that allow for a good deal of human variation and that integrate the analytical powers of the biological and the social into the systematic analysis of human development.\"\n\nIn a paper entitled \"The Five Sexes\", in which, according to her, \"I had intended to be provocative, but I had also written with tongue firmly in cheek.\" Fausto-Sterling laid out a thought experiment considering an alternative model of gender containing five sexes: male, female, merm, ferm, and herm. This thought experiment was interpreted by some as a serious proposal or even a theory; advocates for intersex people stated that this theory was wrong, confusing and unhelpful to the interests of intersex people. In a later paper (\"The Five Sexes, Revisited\"), she has acknowledged these objections.\n\nFausto-Sterling serves on the editorial board of the journal \"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine\" and on the advisory board of the feminist academic journal \"Signs\".\n\nFausto-Sterling is married to Paula Vogel, a Yale professor and Pulitzer-winning playwright. Fausto-Sterling's mother, Dorothy Sterling, was a noted writer and historian while her father was also a published writer.\n\n\"Of Gender and Genitals\" is the third chapter of \"Sexing the Body\" by Fausto-Sterling. The chapter starts with a case study description of sickle cell anemia, including hemoglobin and the risk of having hemoglobin-S crystallize, which leads to intense pain and potential paralysis in times of stress. The lecture on sickle cell anemia ends with two simple conclusions: the first is that a slight alteration to a DNA sequence will leave major changes to the DNA on the whole; the second is that traits and defects cannot be easily predicted. Fausto-Sterling's data goes on to state that genes alone do not decide phenotypes; phenotypes are instead decided by the environmental and developmental history of the person, in addition to their total genetic endowment. In the same regard, behavior is not solely decided by only genetics. The data further goes on to state that while the number of nerves is decided in the former half of pregnancy, cellular interconnection continues to multiply and grow throughout the first four years of life. In addition, the mind and temperament of an adult is shaped by the environment he or she is raised in. Factors included, physical fitness, nutrition, and interpersonal relations with other people. Through these studies and analytical work, the following four gender development theories of biological determinist, psychoanalytic, social learning, and cognitive development have been devised.\n\nFollowing a summary of the prior, Fausto-Sterling shows her points on the gender development theories by noting how XY and XX chromosomes stay identical up until the 6th week of development in the womb. During these six weeks, the XY/XX embryos develop an indifferent gonad, an extra layer that isn't affected by the chromosome embryo due to their indistinguishable similarity at the time. This external process develops in a similar manner to the various male and female reproductive organs that later develop within the body. By the end of the first month and a half, all embryos would've developed, regardless of gender. In addition, the chromosomes within the cells will have developed different sets of mesonephric ducts that are indifferent to gender. A set of ducts ultimately becomes the aforementioned reproductive organs based on the sex of the fetus. Once the Y chromosome in the XY embryo triggers, an extensive and lengthy process is detailed on the development of male fetuses. Conversely, far less is known on the development of XX fetuses. What is known about the female XX is that the fetuses produce approximately the same amount of estrogen in comparison to the testosterone production in the male XY. Later down the line of fetus growth, the originally identical genitalia of the two types of fetus will differentiate on the eighth week. In some cases the XY fetus will initially begin to develop female genitals instead of the male penis and scrotum due to a deficiency in dihydrotestosterone. After detailing the opinions of John Money and Julianne Imperato-McGuinely on gender identity, Fausto-Sterling concludes with the three influences that affect gender – genetic regulatory information, intrusion from outside the womb, and \"chance variation\" in development – and two points on sexual development.\"\n\nSex and gender are two separate characterizations of people and a standard model exists for both sex and gender. Biology characterizes sex by dimorphism. In other words, people are either male or female and nothing in between. Surgical procedures ensure that people are assigned to one of the two accepted sexes. Gender, separate from sex, is socially constructed by culture. People determine the definition of gender by assigning roles to each gender. For example, generally, males are expected to work and women are expected to stay home and care for their family. By assigning a specific role to a gender, we have created a standard model of what it means to be male or female. In essence, the standard model characterizes by masculinity and femininity and separates nature and nurture.\n\nIn chapter three of \"Sexing the Body\", \"Of Gender and Genitals\", Fausto-Sterling criticizes the standard model and the way it impacts those both neither male nor female. She explains that doctors surgically assign infants male or female when they are not born with “normal” genitals. Fausto-Sterling believes that as children grow and become either more masculine or feminine “nurture matters a great deal more than nature” because it affects the child's inclinations towards becoming hetero- or homo- sexual. When doctors studied the spectrum of genders, Sterling criticized that “they never questioned the fundamental assumptions that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexual was to find out more about normal development.” The doctors’ motives for the research of intersexual show that they promote the standard model for sex and are unwilling to accept the fact that there are different variations of sex. Sterling strongly believes that doctors are unethical in that they do not allow variations of sex and immediately assign a sex within a few hours of birth because there is not a way of telling whether the infant will be content with their assigned gender. Furthermore, “whatever treatment they choose…physicians… decide how to manage intersexuality act out of…deeply held beliefs about male and female sexuality [and] gender roles.” Sterling argues that the consequence of performing sexual reassignment surgery on intersex infants “[develops] a language that reinforces the idea that lurking inside the mixed-sex child is a real male or female body.” She claims that this is unacceptable because now that society vehemently believes that only males or females should exist, a window to a spectrum of genders closes. Even more so, those who are born intersex are forced to live unhappy lives full of surgery and scrutiny because they did not fit the standard model. In order to change the standard model, Sterling suggests that we should question, “should there be only two sexes?”\n\nIn chapter three of the book \"Sexing The Body\", titled \"Of Gender and Genitals\", Fausto-Sterling details the sexing of the human body.\nWhen an intersex child is first born, a \"medical emergency\" is called. Gender reassignment surgery is relied upon in order to \"fix the problem\" because the body must have a specific sex. Deciding whether to call a child a boy or a girl, then, employs social definitions of the essential components of gender. Fausto-Sterling describes the \"Phall-o-metrics\", the measurement technique used to determine medically acceptable penis or clitoris. Fausto-Sterling implies that the body is sexed and this sexing comes from the standards that society has placed on what a male and a female are supposed to look like and be. These definitions are primarily cultural, not biological.\n\nBooks\n\nBook Chapters\n\n\n"}

He then studied meteorology and geography in Berlin, where he had as instructors Ferdinand von Richthofen and Wilhelm von Bezold. In 1890 he was an assistant to meteorologist Richard Aßmann at the Meteorological Institute in Berlin. During this period of time he was also secretary of the \"Deutschen Verein zur Förderung der Luftschiffahrt\", the first aeronautical organization in Germany. In 1900 he became \"Hauptobservator\" at the newly founded Aeronautics Observatory in Berlin-Tegel, and was later stationed at the Lindenberg Aeronautical Observatory in Beeskow. From 1896 to 1899 Berson was editor of the magazine \"Zeitschrift für Luftfahrt und Physik der Atmosphäre\" (Magazine for Aviation and Physics of the Atmosphere).\n\nBerson is largely known for his scientific hot-air balloon expeditions. On 4 December 1894, he ascended to a then-record altitude of 9,155 meters aboard the hydrogen balloon \"Phoenix\". On 10 January 1901, with artillery officer Alfred Hildebrandt (1870–1949), he travelled from Berlin to Markaryd, Sweden in a balloon, thus being the first to cross the Baltic Sea by air. On 10 January 1902, with balloonist Hermann Elias (1876–1955), he set the German long-distance ballooning record, as the two men journeyed from Berlin to Poltava in the central Ukraine (1,470 kilometers in 30 hours).\n\nDuring the 1890s, he was involved in international \"simultaneous ascents\" with balloonists from other nations. These ascents were performed in order to study variances of climatic conditions above different locations in Europe, to work to bring about uniformity in methods of observation, and to create increased cooperation among nations in the new science of aerology.\nOn 31 July 1901, with meteorologist Reinhard Süring, he took his most celebrated ascent. Starting from Berlin-Tempelhof aboard the \"Preussen\", Berson and Süring ultimately reached a height of 10,800 meters above sea level. At 6000 m. they required compressed oxygen, at 10,000 m. both scientists were rendered unconscious, and after regaining consciousness were able to land their balloon near Briesen, 7.5 hours after their flight began. Their record ascent had significant scientific importance. Climatic data taken from simultaneously released unmanned sounding balloons agreed with the information gathered from the Berson/Süring ascent. Now scientists such as Richard Aßmann no longer had any reason to distrust temperature readings taken from unmanned balloons, an important factor that led to the discovery of the stratosphere by Aßmann and Teisserenc de Bort in 1902.\n\nAnother important aspect of high-altitude flight involved physiological problems that balloonists could experience when exposed to conditions at great heights. Here, Berson assisted physiologists Hermann von Schrötter and Nathan Zuntz with pioneer experiments in the field of aviation medicine. He undertook high-altitude balloon ascents with the two physiologists, and conducted studies of decompression sickness with a pneumatic chamber located at the \"Jüdischen Krankenhaus\" (Jewish Hospital) in Berlin.\n\nOther significant accomplishments by Berson include climatic studies with weather kites off of Svalbard, pioneer meteorological observations from German East Africa, and aerological research over the Amazon Basin.\n\n\n"}

The first full-scale community wide BBRS was implemented in 1983 by the waste management contractor Ontario Total Recycling Systems Ltd. (a subsidiary of Laidlaw Waste Systems) for the City of Kitchener, Ontario. The blue box recycling system was implemented as part of the city's waste management procedures. The blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.\n\nToday, many municipalities operate blue box programs that accept all forms of paper materials, most plastic packaging, glass containers, aluminum cans and steel cans. For example, the City of Greater Napanee accepts:\n\nThe municipality provides the blue boxes to residents in areas serviced by the recycling program. This usually includes all single-family homes and townhouse units receiving garbage collection. Tenants of apartment buildings typically do not use blue boxes but rather deposit their household recyclable materials in larger containers made available.\n\nAn organization called Pollution Probe was formed in 1969 by students and faculty at the University of Toronto and in 1971, members published a report stressing the need for recycling. Also in 1971, the Canadian Federal Government first established a national Department of the Environment, known as Environment Canada, with Environmental protection as one of its priorities. The Ontario government followed suit with a Ministry of the Environment in 1972.\n\nJack McGinnis of Toronto helped form a community-based non-profit organization called \"Is Five\" Foundation in 1974. Named for a book of poetry by e.e. cummings, Is Five organized Canada’s first multi-material curbside pickup of recyclable material for 80,000 households of The Beaches neighbourhood of east Toronto. In 1977, Jack McGinnis and Derek Stephenson created a private consulting company, Resource Integration Systems (RIS) to advise governments in the field of recycling and waste management.\n\nThat same year, in response to the 1973 energy crisis, Rick Findlay was hired by Environment Canada’s Federal Facilities Program to develop and coordinate a resource conservation program primarily for federal government facilities in Ontario. The program was expected to improve environmental quality and reduce energy demand. The Federal Facilities Program sought advice on a recycling pilot program for Canadian Forces Base Borden and eventually made contact with RIS. RIS experimented with a variety of techniques to improve the performance recycling and found that participation rates were significantly higher when residents could simply drop their recycling in a plastic box. Initially, the project at CFB Borden used milk crates borrowed from a local grocery store. Participation was likely encouraged by a standing order from the Base Commander to recycle.\n\nMeanwhile, a student and a volunteer at a Kitchener/Waterloo, Ontario office of Pollution Probe, Eric Hellman organized \"Garbage Fest 77\" in Kitchener to raise awareness about the consequences of garbage production. McGinnis was invited to speak about his experiences with the CFB Borden program. Hellman also requested a representative from Superior Sanitation (later to be Laidlaw Waste Systems Ltd), the local garbage collection contractor, and an employee named Nyle Ludolph attended Garbage Fest. After meeting McGinnis at the festival, Ludolph became an enthusiastic recycler at his own home and helped increase Laidlaw’s presence in recycling. Nyle managed \"Total Recycling Systems\", a subsidiary of Superior Sanitation/Laidlaw.\n\nIn 1978, Jack McGinnis and Eric Hellman and others met in the basement of the Trinity United Church on Yonge Street in Toronto and created the Recycling Council of Ontario.\n\nIn 1981, after close cooperation with Nyle Ludolph, RIS submitted a proposal to Laidlaw to collect and recycle materials at the curbside for a pilot project in Kitchener, Ontario. Lillian and Ken Croal of Kitchener were the first to use and receive a blue box. RIS designed the program, and Total Recycling had the responsibility to handle all operations. The Kitchener project included 1,500 households and was tested with four different approaches to recycling:\n\nThe blue box recycling system was proposed to be included as an included “extra” to the regular waste management contract. Laidlaw was successful in obtaining the waste management contract for Kitchener, and the blue box system had its commercial launch. RIS came up with the slogan “We Recycle”, which was applied to every box that went out in Kitchener. Various reasons why the boxes were coloured blue, as opposed to some other colour have been posited: the facts are that RIS felt they looked best and were most visible in blue. It was also a colour that was suitable in terms of withstanding damage from ultraviolet light.\n\nThe four recycling approaches were monitored by RIS for one year and the blue box was decided as the most effective. The “test project” continued to run however, and people who did not have the blue boxes began requesting them. Laidlaw received many letters from residents expressing support for the program and for it to continue. The blue box program was implemented citywide in 1983, with Laidlaw providing the extra investment in additional boxes and trucks and handling equipment even though it was not required by their waste management contract with the City. Participation rates ran at 85 percent, and the program was regarded as a success.\n\nIn 1984 the Citywide contract for Kitchener went out to public bid, as previously scheduled. City staff simply followed previous procedures – i.e., no specific requirement to offer recycling services was included in bid documents. Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw. The Council meeting where the decision was made was filled with local citizens, especially students, asking their City to support the blue box. The City did, voting to take the blue box bid, not the low bid.\n\nIn 1985, Laidlaw won the bid for recycling in the City of Mississauga and introduced the second commercial blue box program in Ontario in June 1986, the largest recycling effort in North America.\n\nBetween 1997 and 1999, Laidlaw, Inc. exited the solid waste business after incurring heavy losses through its investments in Safety-Kleen and Greyhound Lines. After almost 20 years of expansion, Laidlaw Inc. filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2001.\nCurrently in Ontario, Canada industry compensates municipalities for approximately 50% of the net costs to operate the blue box program.\n\nThe blue box system and variations of it remain in place in hundreds of cities around the world.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6015943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6015943", "title": "Caste systems in Africa", "text": "Caste systems in Africa\n\nCaste systems in Africa are a form of social stratification found in numerous ethnic groups, found in over fifteen countries, particularly in the Sahel, West African and North African region. These caste systems feature endogamy, hierarchical status, inherited occupation, membership by birth, pollution concepts and restraints on commensality.\n\nThe specifics of the caste systems in Africa vary among the ethnic groups. Some societies have a rigid and strict caste system with embedded slavery, whereas others are more diffuse and complex. Countries in Africa that have societies with caste systems include Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Niger, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Liberia, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Algeria, Nigeria, Chad, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea and others. While it is unclear when and how the caste systems developed in Africa, they are not ancient and likely developed sometime between the 9th century and 15th century in various ethnic groups, probably in conjunction with the institution of slavery.\n\nThe social stratification of the Amhara people of Ethiopia includes castes. According to Donald Levine – a professor of Sociology specializing in Ethiopian society, the Amhara society has consisted of high-ranking clans, low-ranking clans, caste groups (artisans), and slaves. The Amhara caste system was hierarchically higher than its lowest slaves strata.\n\nThe Amhara caste system consisted of: (1) endogamy, (2) hierarchical status, (3) restraints on commensality, (4) pollution concepts, (5) each caste has had a traditional occupation, and (6) inherited caste membership. This caste system has been a rigid, endogamous and occupationally closed social stratification among Amhara and other Afro-Asiatic-speaking Ethiopian ethnic groups. However, some state it as an economically closed, endogamous class system or as occupational minorities, whereas others such as the historian David Todd state that this system can be unequivocally labelled as caste-based.\n\nThe Borana people are found in southern Ethiopia, Somalia and northeastern Kenya. They have historically had castes, among which the hunters and artisans have constituted the depressed strata. These are endogamous castes each with a specialized inherited occupation, and include a strata that constitutes outcastes. They are found in virtually every Cushitic or Semitic community of this region. These castes are neither Negroid nor Bushmanoid by physical features or their first language.\n\nThe lower castes of the Borana people, states Herbert Lewis – a professor of Anthropology specializing on East African societies, show no physical differences from the noble castes of Somalia and Somalilands. Other than endogamy and occupational differences between the castes, their ritual, social and political positions are different, as are the beliefs held by each about the nature of the other. For example, the castes have long considered each other as ritually impure, and food prepared by either nobles or artisans castes is considered a taboo to others. Similarly, traditionally, the craftsman and the noble are ritually forbidden to enter the house of the other. Low caste people are expected not to handle farm equipment or cattle.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the outcaste groups include the Weyto, who live on the shores of Lake Tana and are despised for eating hippopotamus meat.\n\nThe Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, also found in northern Kenya and Somalia, with an estimated total population of over 35 million.\n\nLike other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the \"Borana\", below them were the \"Gabbaro\" (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the \"dhalatta\"). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.\n\nIn the Islamic Kingdom of Jimma, the Oromo society's caste strata predominantly consisted of endogamous, inherited artisanal occupations. Each caste group has specialized in a particular occupation such as iron working, carpentry, weapon making, pottery, weaving, leather working and hunting.\n\nThe castes in the Oromo society have had a designated name, such as \"Tumtu\" were smiths, \"Fuga\" were potters, \"Faqi\" were tanners and leatherworkers, \"Semmano\" for weavers, \"Gagurtu\" were bee keepers and honey makers, \"Watta\" were hunters and foragers. While slaves were an endogamous strata within the Oromo society, they themselves were also victims of slavery. By the 19th century, Oromo slaves were sought after and a major part of slaves sold in Gondar and Gallabat slave markets at Ethiopia-Sudan border, as well as the Massawa and Tajura markets on the Red Sea.\n\nThe Somalis are a Muslim ethnic group of between 15 and 20 million people, constituting the largest ethnicity in Somalia, many of whom also live in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti.\n\nThey have historically exhibited social stratification that has included embedded castes referred to as \"Higal\" (or \"Higalki\", \"Argobba\"). The upper noble strata has been called \"Gob\" (or Asha), while the lower servile strata have been referred to as \"Sáb\". The three main Somali castes are called \"Tumal\" (sometimes spelled \"Tomal\"), \"Midgan\" and \"Yibir\" (sometimes spelled \"Yebir\"). These fell outside of the traditional clan structure. The castes have been endogamous, a person born into it inherited its occupation. The \"Midgan\" have been the hunters, \"Tumal\" were the smiths, pottery and leatherworking caste, and the \"Yibir\" have been the saddle and prayer mat makers and magician caste. Below the castes have been the Somali Bantu \"Jareer\" community, and these have been descendants of former slaves, including those who were runaway and emancipated slaves.\n\nAccording to Mohamed Eno and Abdi Kusow, the Somali caste communities are ethnically indistinguishable from each other, but upper castes have stigmatized the lower ones with mythical narratives such as they being of unholy origins or being engaged in dirty occupations. The four strata social system – high lineage, low lineage, caste groups and slaves – found among the Somalis has been common in the Horn of Africa region, states Donald Levine, and is also found among ethnic groups such as Afar, Amhara, Borana, Leqa, Sidamo, Kefa, Janjero and other peoples.\n\nAccording to Catherine Besteman - a professor of Anthropology, the widespread purchase of non-Somali African slaves during the medieval age helped structure the complex status hierarchy among the Somalis. However, adds Besteman, the Somali people from the upper strata have also been egalitarian in matters of clan leadership, while they have included concepts of social status, inferiority and exclusion of \"Sáb\" and slaves. In the northern regions where Somalis are traditionally found, states Iaon Lewis, Somali communities have traditionally distinguished between the artisanal Somali castes and their slaves, but in the south they have blurred these distinctions.\n\nThe castes among Somali people have also existed in other east and northeast African ethnic groups. In east African ethnic groups, such as the Oromo people for example, cognates to Somali castes have been recorded in 16th century texts, states Cornelius Jaenen. The table below illustrate some alternate terms for castes mirroring the Somali Madhiban in other ethnic groups that share this region with the Somali people. Similarly, equivalent terms for castes in other northeast and east African ethnic groups mirror other castes such as the Tomal and the Yibir of Somali people.\n\nThe Muslim Moors society in the Maghreb parts of the North Africa was traditionally (and still is, to some extent) stratified. According to Rebecca Popenoe – a professor of Anthropology, while the Islamic scriptures do not dictate a caste system, and while caste systems are not divinely ordained, the Moors believe that castes are \"fundamentally different sorts of people\" and find the root of the caste system in early Islam. The slave caste in the Moors' belief system have descended from Bilal, the slave of Muhammad, while the artisan castes are descendants of those \"who refused to accept Allah\". In Mauritanian context, the Kafa'a doctrine has been developed as a justification for considering family status before marriage, annulment of marriages between unequal people, and endogamy.\n\nMoors have owned slaves for centuries. The slaves are traditionally called Haratin and \"`Abid\", and they were the lowest status endogamous castes, largely segregated oasis-dwelling black people, in the Moors society.\n\nThe Haratin of Mauritania, states Joseph Hellweg – a professor of Anthropology specializing on West African studies, were part of a social caste-like hierarchy that likely developed between 1300 to 1500 CE because of a Bedouin legacy. The \"Hassan\" monopolized the occupations related to war and politics, the \"Zwaya\" (Zawaya) the religious roles, the \"Bidan\" (White Moors) owned property and held slaves (Haratins, Black Moors), and the slaves constituted the lowest of the social strata. Each of these were castes, endogamous, with hereditary occupations and where the upper strata collected tribute (\"horma\") from the lower strata of Mauritanian society, considered them socially inferior, and denied them the right to own land or weapons thereby creating a socio-economically closed system.\n\nAmong Hassaniya Arabic speakers in southern Morocco and Mauritania, states Sean Hanretta – a professor of African History, the term \"Bidan\" is a \"caste synecdoche\" that refers to \"Hassani\" (warrior) and \"Zwaya\" (clerical) clans. In the slave castes, they recognized two layers, the \"`Abid\" (slaves) and \"Haratins\" (freed slaves). According to Remco Ensel – a professor of Anthropology specializing in Maghreb studies, the word \"Haratin\" in Moroccan is a pejorative that connotes \"subordination, disrepute\" and in contemporary literature, it is often replaced with \"Drawi\", \"Drawa\", \"Sahrawi\", \"Sahrawa\" or other regional terms. The \"Haratins\" historically lived segregated from the main society, in a rural isolation. Their subjugation regardless of their religion was sometimes ideologically justified by nobles and some Islamic scholars, even though some scholars took a more nuanced view that Muslims can only enslave non-Muslims and they should not enslave other Muslims, states Hamel – a professor of History specializing in African Studies. They along with \"Swasin\" in Morocco and other northern fringe societies of the Sahara, were a part of a social hierarchy that included the upper strata of nobles, religious specialists and literati, followed by freemen, nomadic pastoral strata and slaves. The Haratin were hierarchically higher than the \"`Abid\" (descendant of slaves) at the very bottom, but lower than \"Ahrar\". This hierarchy, states Ensel, has been variously described as ethnic groups, estates, quasi-castes, castes or classes.\n\nThe Tuareg people are a large Berber ethnic confederation found in North Africa. They principally inhabit the Sahara desert, in a vast area stretching from far southwestern Libya to southern Algeria, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. Traditionally nomadic pastoralists, small groups of Tuareg are also found in northern Nigeria. Tuareg society has traditionally featured clan membership, social status and caste hierarchies within each political confederation. These hierarchical systems have included nobles, clerics, craftsmen and unfree strata of people.\n\nIn Tuareg hierarchical caste system, the nobles constitute the highest caste. They are known in the Tuareg language as \"imúšaɣ\" (\"Imajaghan\", \"the proud and free\" in Arabic). The nobles had a monopoly on carrying arms and camels, were the warriors of the Tuareg regions. They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warror nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own. A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called \"amanokal\", whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs. The chietain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.\n\nThe vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles. They are known as \"ímɣad\" (\"Imghad\", singular \"Amghid\") in the Tuareg language. Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation. The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual \"tiwse\", or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who is traveling through their territory. In late medieval era, states Prasse, this weapon monopoly broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors. After the start of the French colonial rule which dislodged the nobles from their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead warrior or intellectual work.\n\nA semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the \"marabouts\" (Tuareg: \"Ineslemen\", a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic). After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure. According to Norris, this strata of Muslim clerics has been a sacredotal caste, which propagated Islam in North Africa and the Sahel between the 7th and the 17th centuries. Adherence to the faith was initially centered around this caste, but later spread to the wider Tuareg community. The marabouts have traditionally been the judges (\"qadi\") and religious leaders (\"imam\") of a Tuareg community.\n\nAccording to the anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the \"Inhædˤæn\" (\"Inadan\"). These have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes. They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, and carried messages over distances for their patron family. They also are the ones who traditionally sacrifice animals during Islamic festivals.\n\nThese social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their oral traditions. They are called \"Agguta\" by Tuareg, have been called upon to sing during ceremonies such as weddings or funerals. The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a Jewish derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls \"a much vexed question\". Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesman has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.\n\nAccording to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. On this point, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is endogamy among castes among Tuareg in Niger. The smith explained, \"Nobles are like rice, Smiths are like millet, Slaves are like corn.\"\n\nIn the Tuareg areas of Algeria, a distinct tenant-peasant strata lives around oases known as \"izeggaghan\" (or \"hartani\" in Arabic). Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce. Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed black slaves and farm arable lands together.\n\nAccording to the historian Starratt, the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave's expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation. The \"Ikelan\" later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society. According to Heath, the \"Bella\" in the Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.\n\nThe Fula people are one of the largest and a widely dispersed Muslim ethnic group in Sahel and West Africa. They number between 20 and 25 million people in total across many countries of this region, and they have historically featured a caste system.\n\nThe Fula caste system has been fairly rigid and has medieval roots. It was well established by the 15th-century, and it has survived into modern age. The four major castes, states Martin Kich, in their order of status are \"nobility, traders, tradesmen (such as blacksmith) and descendants of slaves\". According to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Fulani people have held on to \"a strict caste system\".\n\nThe upper caste consists of the nobles. Below these are the marabouts or clerics, then the cattle owning Fula people. Below all these are the artisan castes, which includes the blacksmiths, potters, griots, genealogists, woodworkers, and dressmakers. They belong to castes but are not enslaved and are \"free people\". Then there are those castes of captive, slave or serf ancestry: the \"Maccuɗo\", \"Rimmayɓe\", \"Dimaajo\", and less often \"Ɓaleeɓe\", the Fulani equivalent of the Tuareg Ikelan known as Bouzou (Buzu)/Bella in the Hausa and Songhay languages respectively.\n\nThe Fulani castes are endogamous in nature, meaning individuals marry only within their caste. This caste system, however, wasn't as elaborate in places like northern Nigeria, Eastern Niger or Cameroon. According to some estimates, by the late 19th century, slaves constituted about 50% of the population of the Fulɓe-ruled Adamawa Emirate, where they were referred to as \"jeyaɓe\" (singular \"jeyado\"). Though very high, these figures are representative of many other emirates of the Sokoto Caliphate, of which Adamawa formed a part. The castes-based social stratification among the Fula people was widespread and seen across the Sahel, such as Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, and others.\n\nThe Osu caste system in Nigeria and southern Cameroon of the Igbo people can be traced back to Odinani, the traditional Igbo religion. It is the belief of many Igbo traditionalists that the Osus are people historically owned by deities, and are therefore considered to be a 'living sacrifice', an outcast, untouchable and sub-human (similar to the Roman practice of \"homo sacer\"). This system received literary attention when it became a key plot point in \"No Longer at Ease\" by Chinua Achebe.\n\nPeople regarded as modern-day Osu in Igboland are descendants of individuals who volunteered and were sacrificed to the various gods. These fore-fathers pledged themselves and their descendants to these gods. They enjoyed protection and privileges but were segregated from ordinary folks. These Osu people married, fraternized and socialized among themselves. The practice continued to this day. An ordinary Igbo person would not marry or permit any of his relations to marry an Osu person. In a few instances where that has happened, every member of that non-Osu who married an Osu became infested and were regarded as Osu.\n\nIt can be said that the only aspect of Igbo life that keeps the Osu segregation intact is marriage. An Osu could and could only marry a fellow Osu, and no more. It is a taboo and abhorent for an Osu to marry a non-Osu - love or lust being immaterial.\n\nSome suggest that due to the introduction of modernization, the Osu system is gradually leaving Igboland and tradition. The influence of Christianity (specifically Roman Catholicism) has caused Odinani to start slowly disappearing from Igboland. Obinna, in 2012, reports that in the Igbo community - especially in Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states - Osu caste system remains a social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into the Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.\n\nAmong the Mande societies in Mali, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana, people are divided by occupation and ethnic ties. The highest hierarchy in the Mande caste system, the Horon (nobles/freeborn), are traditionally farmers, fisherman, warriors and animal breeders, the lowest caste are the Jonow, a \"slave\" caste, made up of people whose ancestors were enslaved by other Africans during tribal wars. An important feature of this system are castes based on trade, such as blacksmiths and griots.\n\nThe Mandinka people are a West African ethnic group with an estimated population of eleven million with roots in western Sahel, in Mali, but now widely dispersed. Over 99% of Mandinka are Muslim.<\n\nThe Mandinka people live primarily in West Africa, particularly in the Gambia and the Guinea where they are the largest ethnic group. Major populations of the Mandinka people also live in Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Mauritania. Their traditional society has featured socially stratified castes, from at least the 13th century.\n\nThe Mandinka society, states Arnold Hughes – a professor of West African Studies and African Politics, has been \"divided into three endogamous castes – the freeborn (\"foro\"), slaves (\"jongo\"), and artisans and praise singers (\"nyamolo\"). The freeborn castes are primarily farmers, while the slave strata included labor providers to the farmers, as well as leather workers, pottery makers, metal smiths, griots and others. The Mandinka Muslim clerics and scribes have traditionally been a separate endogamous occupational caste called \"Jakhanke\", with their Islamic roots traceable to about the 13th-century.\n\nThe Mandinka castes are hereditary, and marriages outside the caste was forbidden. Their caste system is similar to those of other ethnic groups of the African Sahel region, and found across the Mandinka communities such as those in Gambia, Mali, Guinea and other countries.\n\nThe Serer people are a West African ethnoreligious group found in Senegal making up 15% of the Senegalese population. They are also found in northern Gambia and southern Mauritania. The Serer society, like other ethnic groups in Senegal, has had social stratification featuring endogamous castes and slaves.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Berg, Ruth Wan and Ruth Lau, Serer people in Senegal did not have a caste system before the Malinka rulers conquered them and introduced a caste system. In other regions where Serer people are found, state JD Fage, Richard Gray and Roland Oliver, the Wolof and Toucouleur peoples introduced the caste system among the Serer people.\n\nThe social stratification historically evidenced among the Serer people has been, except for one difference, very similar to those found among Wolof, Fulbe, Toucouleur and Mandinka peoples found in Senegambia. They all have had strata of free nobles and peasants, artisan castes, and slaves. The difference is that the Serer people have retained a matrilineal inheritance system. According to Martin Klein – a professor of History specializing in African Studies, the caste systems among the Serer emerged as a consequence of the Mandinka people's Sine-Saloum guelowar conquest, and when the Serer people sought to adapt and participate in the new Senegambian state system.\n\nThe hierarchical highest status among the Serer people has been those of hereditary nobles and their relatives, which meant blood links to the Mandinka conquerors. Below the nobles, came \"tyeddo\", or the warriors and chiefs who had helped the Mandinka rulers and paid tribute. The third status, and the largest strata came to be the \"jambur\", or free peasants who lacked the power of the nobles. Below the \"jambur\" were the artisan castes, who inherited their occupation. These castes included blacksmiths, weavers, jewelers, leatherworkers, carpenters, griots who kept the oral tradition through songs and music. Of these all castes had a taboo in marrying a griot, and they could not be buried like others. Below the artisan castes in social status have been the slaves, who were either bought at slave markets, seized as captives, or born to a slave parent.\n\nThe slave castes continue to be despised, they do not own land and work as tenant farmers, marriage across caste lines is forbidden and lying about one's caste prior to marriage has been a ground for divorce. The land has been owned by the upper social strata, with the better plots near the villages belonging to the nobles. The social status of the slave has been inherited by birth.\n\nThe Senufo people are found in a region spanning the northern Ivory Coast, the southeastern Mali and the western Burkina Faso. One sub-group, the Nafana, is found in north-western Ghana.\n\nThe Senufo people have traditionally been a socially stratified society that has included castes and slaves. These endogamous divisions are locally called \"Katioula\", and one of the strata in this division includes slaves and descendants of slaves. According to Dolores Richter, the caste system found among Senufo people features \"hierarchical ranking including despised lower castes, occupational specificity, ritual complementarity, endogamy, hereditary membership, residential isolation and the political superiority of farmers over artisan castes\".\n\nThe Soninke people are a West African ethnic group found in eastern Senegal and its capital Dakar, northwestern Mali and southern Mauritania. Predominantly Muslims, the Soninke were one of the early ethnic groups from Sub-Saharan West Africa to convert to Islam about the 10th century. The contemporary population of Soninke people is estimated to be over 2 million. The cultural practices of Soninke people are similar to the Mandé peoples, and includes social stratification. According to the anthropologist Tal Tamari, the Soninke society became highly stratified after the thirteenth century.\n\nThe Soninke strata have included a free category called \"Horro\" or \"Horon\", a caste system category called \"Namaxala\" or \"Nyaxamalo\", and slaves called \"Komo\". In the Jaara subgroup of the Soninke people, the nobility called \"Tunkanlenmu\" was another strata.\n\nThe slaves were the largest strata, one at the bottom among the Soninke like other West African ethnic groups, and constituted up to half of the population. The slaves among the Soninke people were hierarchically arranged into three strata. The village slaves were a privileged servile group who lived apart from the village and took orders from the village chief. The domestic slaves lived in with a family and could not be sold. The lowest level among slaves were the trade slaves who could be bought and sold. With time, each of these strata became endogamous, states Daniel Littlefield – a professor of History.\n\nAbove the slaves were the castes of Soninke, which too were hereditary, endogamous and had an embedded hierarchical status. They included, for example, the \"garanke\" (leather workers) below the \"fune\" (bard), the \"fune\" below the \"gesere\" or \"jeli\" (griots, singers), the \"jeli\" below the \"tage\" or \"numu\" (smiths, pottery workers).\n\nThe Susu people are a West African ethnic group, one of the Mandé peoples living primarily in Guinea. Influential in Guinea, smaller communities of Susu people are also found in the neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. The Susu are a patrilineal society, predominantly Muslim, who favor endogamous cross-cousin marriages with polygynous households common. They have a caste system like all Manding-speaking peoples of West Africa, where the artisans such as smiths, carpenters, musicians, jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes, and believed to have descended from the medieval era slavery.\n\nThe Susu people, like other Manding-speaking peoples, have a caste system regionally referred to by terms such as \"Nyamakala\", \"Naxamala\" and \"Galabbolalauba\". According to David Conrad and Barbara Frank, the terms and social categories in this caste-based social stratification system of Susu people shows cases of borrowing from Arabic only, but the likelihood is that these terms are linked to Latin, Greek or Aramaic.\n\nThe artisans among Susu people such as smiths, carpenters, musicians and bards (\"Yeliba\"), jewelers and leatherworkers are separate castes. The Susu people believe that these castes have descended from the medieval era slaves. The Susu castes are not limited to Guinea, but are found in other regions where Susu people live, such as in Sierra Leone where too they are linked to the historic slavery system that existed in the region, states Daniel Harmon. The Susu castes in the regional Muslim communities were prevalent and recorded by sociologists in late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe Temne people are a West African ethnic group. They are predominantly found in the northwestern and central parts of Sierra Leone, as well as the national capital Freetown. Some Temne are also found in Guinea. The Temne constitute the largest ethnic group in Sierra Leone, at 35% of the total population. Temne society consists of patrilineal clans, is predominantly a mix of Muslim and polytheists, and some clans feature castes.\n\nThe artisans and musicians in the Temne society have been endogamous caste people. The terminology of this social stratification system and the embedded hierarchy may have been adopted among the Temne from the nearby Mandinka people, Fula people and Susu people. The caste hierarchy and social stratification has been more well established in the northern Islamic parts of Temne territories. The endogamous slave castes were held in Temne clans as agriculture workers and domestic servants, and they formed the lowest subservient layer of the social strata. Enslaved women served as domestic workers, wives and concubines.\n\nThe Toucouleur people are a Muslim West African ethnic group found mostly in Futa Toro region of Senegal, with some in Mali and Mauritania. The Toucouleur embraced Islam in the 11th century, their early and strong Islamic heritage is a matter of great pride for them. They have been influential in the spread of Islam to West Africa in the medieval era, later founded the vast Tukulor Empire in the 19th century under Umar Tal that led a religious war against their neighboring ethnic groups and the French colonial forces. The Toucouleur society has been patrilineal, polygynous and with high social stratification that included slavery and caste system.\n\nToucouleur society is divided into strict and rigid caste hierarchies.\n\nThe highest status among the five Toucouleur castes is of the aristocratic leaders and Islamic scholars called \"Torobe\". Below them are the \"Rimbe\", or the administrators, traders and farmers. The \"Nyenbe\" are the artisan castes of the Toucouleur society. The fourth caste strata is called the \"Gallunkobe\" or the slaves or descendants of slaves \"who have been freed\". The bottom strata among the Toucouleurs are the \"Matyube\" or slaves. The slaves were acquired by raiding pagan ethnic groups or purchased in slave markets, or the status was inherited.\n\nThe hierarchical social stratification has been an economically closed system, which historically has meant a marked inequality. Property and land has been exclusively owned by the upper caste members. Occupations and caste memberships are inherited. The Toucouleur castes have been endogamous, segregated and intermarriage has been rare. The clerics among Toucouleur like the Wolof people formed a separate group. The religious leaders were not necessarily endogamous nor an inherited post in Toucouleur people's long history, but it has been rare for lower caste people to become religious specialist, states Rüdiger Seesemann, as they were viewed as not sufficiently adhering to the \"clerical standards of piety\".\n\nThe Wolof people are a West African Muslim ethnic group found in northwestern Senegal, The Gambia, and southwestern coastal Mauritania. In Senegal, the Wolof are the largest ethnic group (~ 39%), and their combined population exceeds 6 million. The Wolof people, like other West African ethnic groups, have historically maintained a rigid, endogamous social stratification that included nobility, clerics, castes and slaves. The Wolof caste system has existed at least since the 15th-century.\n\nThe social strata have included a free category called \"geer\", a castes category called \"nyeenyo\" or \"neeno\", and a servile category of slaves called \"jaam\". Caste status has been hereditary, and endogamy among the men and women of a particular caste status has been an enduring feature among the Wolof people, states Leonardo Villalón – a professor of Political Science and African Studies. The Wolof's caste status, states Villalón, has been and is a greater barrier to inter-marriage than is either ethnicity or religion in Senegal.\n\nThe castes have also been hierarchal, with lowest level being those of griots. Their inherited inferiority has been culturally stated to be close to those of slaves (\"jaams\" or \"kaals\"). The castes, states David Gamble, were associated with ideas of relative purity-impurity. The leatherworkers, for example, were considered the lowest of the \"nyenyo\" because their occupation involving animal skins was considered dirty.\n\nSlaves have historically been a separate, endogamous group in the Wolof society. Slavery was either inherited by birth in the Wolof society, or were kidnapped, purchased as children from desperate parents during difficult times such as a famine, or slavery was imposed by the village elders as a punishment for offenses. By the early 18th-century, all sorts of charges and petty crimes resulted in the accused being punished to the slave strata. Slaves acquired by kidnapping, purchase or as captives of war were called \"jaam sayor\" in the Wolof society.\n\nThe \"geer\" or \"freeborn\" too had a hierarchical structure. At the top were the royal rulers, below them were the regionally or locally powerful noble lineages who controlled territories and collected tribute, and below them were commoner freeborn called the \"baadoolo\" or \"lacking power\".\n\nThe Zarma people are an ethnic group predominantly found in westernmost Niger also found in significant numbers in the adjacent areas of Nigeria and Benin, along with smaller numbers in Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Ghana. The Zarma people are predominantly Muslims of the Maliki-Sunni school, and they live in the arid Sahel lands, along the Niger River valley which is a source of irrigation, forage for cattle herds, and drinking water. The Zarma people have had a history of slave and caste system, like many West African ethnic groups.\n\nThe Zarma people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like the Songhai people, featuring castes, state Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan, Tal Tamari and other scholars. According to the medieval and colonial era descriptions, their vocation has been hereditary, and each stratified group has been endogamous. The social stratification embedded slavery, wherein the lowest strata of the population inherited slavery, and second the \"Zima\" or priests and Islamic clerics had to be initiated but did not automatically inherit that profession, making the cleric strata a pseudo-caste. According to Ralph Austen – a professor emeritus of African history, the caste system among the Zarma people was not as well developed as the caste system historically found in the African ethnic groups further west to them.\nThe different strata of the Zarma-Songhai people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit. Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class. The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations. The highest social level, states Shoup, claim to have descended from king \"Sonni 'Ali Ber\" and their modern era hereditary occupation has been \"Sohance\" (sorcerer). The traditionally free strata of the Zerma people have owned property and herds, and these have dominated the political system and governments during and after the French colonial rule. Within the stratified social system, the Islamic system of polygynous marriages is a part of the Zarma people tradition, with preferred partners being cross cousins, and a system of ritualistic acceptance between co-wives. This endogamy is similar to other ethnic groups in West Africa.\n\nThe Mandara people are a Central African Muslim ethnic group found in north Cameroon, northeastern Nigeria, and southeastern Chad. They have lived in the mountainous region and valleys north of the Benue River in Cameroon, converted to Islam sometime around the 16th century, and have long been a part of the Mandara Sultanate.\n\nThe Mandara society developed into a socially stratified system, with Sultan and royalty, farmers, horse breeders, artisans, iron workers and smiths forming a distinct endogamous occupation-inheriting castes. The caste system among the Mandara people integrated the concept that the strata have innate pollution and therefore they are stigmatized, however there is no evidence that their Islamic belief integrated the differences between the socially differentiated castes in their society to have been divinely sanctioned. The Mandara people also featured an endogamous slave strata.\n\nThe Toubou people are an Islamic ethnic group inhabiting northern Chad, southern Libya, northeastern Niger, and northwestern Sudan.\n\nThe Toubou people, states Jean Chapelle – a professor of History specializing on Chadian ethnic groups, have been socially stratified with an embedded caste system. The three strata have consisted of the freemen with a right to own property, the artisanal castes and the slaves.\n\nThe endogamous caste of \"Azza\" (or \"Aza\") among Toubou have the artisanal occupations, such as metal work, leather work, pottery and tailoring, and they have traditionally been despised and segregated by other strata of the Toubou, much like the \"Hadahid\" caste in southeastern Chad among the Zaghawa people. Marriage between a member of the blacksmith caste and a member from a different strata of the Toubou people has been culturally unacceptable. The strata locally called \"Kamadja\" were the slaves. The language used by the Azza people is a variant of the Tebu language, but mutually intelligible.\n\nThe Zaghawa people, also called \"Beri\" or Zakhawa, are a Central African Muslim ethnic group of eastern Chad and western Sudan, including Darfur. The Zaghawa are mentioned in classical Arabic language texts by Islamic historians and geographers. The century in which the Zaghawa people adopted Islam has been a subject of debate and little consensus, with estimates ranging from the 13th to the early 17th century.\n\nThe Zaghawa society has been socially stratified and has included castes. The upper strata has been of nobles and warriors, below them have been the traders and merchants, below whom have been the artisan castes called the \"Hadaheed\" (or \"Hadahid\"). These castes have been endogamous, and their inherited occupations have included iron work, hunters, pottery, leatherwork and musicians such as drummers. The artisan work has traditionally been viewed within the Zaghawa society as dirty and of inferior status, being people from different pagan and Jewish roots who slowly assimilated into the Islamic society.\n\nThe term \"blacksmith\" has been a derogatory term in Zaghawa culture, states Anne Haour – a professor of African Studies and Medieval Archaeology, and \"if born a blacksmith one will always be a blacksmith\". Non-blacksmith castes of Zaghawa neither eat nor associate with the blacksmith castes. The lowest strata has been the slaves. The social stratification and castes such as for the leatherworker strata within the Zaghawa people is similar to those found in nearby Fur people.\n\nThe Merina people are the largest ethnic group in Madagascar. They historically have had a highly stratified caste system. The Merina society emerged in the 15th century in the central high plateau region of Madagascar. Its society, like many ethnic groups in Africa, had two category of people, the free locally called the \"fotsy\", and the serfs or \"mainty\". These were divided into three strata: the \"Andriana\" (nobles), the \"Hova\" (freemen), and the lowest strata called \"Andevo\" (slaves).\n\nEach strata was hierarchically subdivided. The \"Andriana\" are divided into six sub-strata, for example, each had an inherited occupation, and were endogamous.\n\nThe nineteenth century records show that \"Andevo\" or slaves were imported black Africans, and they constituted about a third of the Merina society. The Merina society sold highland slaves to both Muslim and European slave traders on Madagascar coast, as well as bought East African and Mozambique-sourced slaves from them for their own plantations between 1795 and 1895. Marriage and any sexual relations between the upper strata \"fotsy\" and the lower strata \"mainty\" were a taboo. According to a 2012 report by Gulnara Shahinian – the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the descendants of former slave castes continue to suffer in contemporary Madagascar Merina society, and inter-caste marriages continue to be socially ostracized.\n\nThe caste systems in Africa have been linked to the a pre-developed trading network, invasions from North Africa and the Middle East after the 7th century, followed by a slavery system that targeted the pagans. According to Susan McIntosh – a professor of Anthropology specializing in African societies, archeological evidence shows that Arabs and Berbers had expanded and established an integrated sub-Saharan trade and transport network with West Africa, building upon the pre-existing trade routes through Western Sudan. This trade by 9th to 10th centuries, states McIntosh, included commodities and slaves. The reach of slave trading had extended into Ghana and the western Atlantic coast by the 11th century, and the slave raiding, capture, holding and trading systems became increasingly sophisticated in 13th and 14th century Mali Empire and 16th century Songhai Empire.\n\nAs the practice of slavery grew, so did the caste system. Tamari suggests that a corollary of the rising slavery system was the development and growth of the caste system among numerous ethnic groups of Africa by about the 13th century. McIntosh concurs with Tamari's reasoning approach, but disagrees with the dating. McIntosh states that the emergence of caste systems likely occurred much earlier in the West African societies such as Soninke, Mande, Malinke, Wolof, Serer, and others. She places the development and spread of castes in these societies to about the 10th-century, because the slave capture, slave trade and slave holding by elite families was an established institution in West Africa by then, and slavery created a template for servile relationships and social stratification of human beings.\n\nThe linguistic evidence suggests that stratification structure and words relating to caste system and slavery likely were shared between the many ethnic groups, and possibly some others such as the Dogon people of West Africa. However, the linguistic differences between the caste and slave systems between Soninke and northern ethnic groups of Africa such as the Tuareg people and Moors suggests that these evolved separately.\n\nLouis Dumont, the 20th-century author famous for his classic \"Homo Hierarchicus\", recognized the social stratification among the ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system. Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont's system, including economic, ritual, spiritual, endogamous, elements of pollution, segregative and spread over a large region. According to Anne Haour – a professor of African Studies, some scholars consider the historic caste-like social stratification among African communities to be a pre-Islam feature while some consider it derived from the Arab influence.\n\n"}
{"id": "9515578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9515578", "title": "Cellular manufacturing", "text": "Cellular manufacturing\n\nCellular manufacturing is a process of manufacturing which is a subsection of just-in-time manufacturing and lean manufacturing encompassing group technology. The goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as possible, make a wide variety of similar products, while making as little waste as possible. Cellular manufacturing involves the use of multiple \"cells\" in an assembly line fashion. Each of these cells is composed of one or multiple different machines which accomplish a certain task. The product moves from one cell to the next, each station completing part of the manufacturing process. Often the cells are arranged in a \"U-shape\" design because this allows for the overseer to move less and have the ability to more readily watch over the entire process. One of the biggest advantages of cellular manufacturing is the amount of flexibility that it has. Since most of the machines are automatic, simple changes can be made very rapidly. This allows for a variety of scaling for a product, minor changes to the overall design, and in extreme cases, entirely changing the overall design. These changes, although tedious, can be accomplished extremely quickly and precisely.\n\nA cell is created by consolidating the processes required to create a specific output, such as a part or a set of instructions. These cells allow for the reduction of extraneous steps in the process of creating the specific output, and facilitate quick identification of problems and encourage communication of employees within the cell in order to resolve issues that arise quickly. Once implemented, cellular manufacturing has been said to \"reliably\" create massive gains in productivity and quality while simultaneously reducing the amount of inventory, space and lead time required to create a product. It is for this reason that the one-piece-flow cell has been called \"the ultimate in lean production.\"\n\nCellular manufacturing is derivative of principles of group technology, which were proposed by Flanders in 1925 and adopted in Russia by Mitrofanov in 1933 (whose book was translated into English in 1959). Burbidge actively promoted group technology in the 1970s. \"Apparently, Japanese firms began implementing cellular manufacturing sometime in the 1970s,\" and in the 1980s cells migrated to the United States as an element of just-in-time (JIT) production.\n\nOne of the first English-language books to discuss cellular manufacturing, that of Hall in 1983, referred to a cell as a “U-line,” for the common, or ideal, U-shaped configuration of a cell—ideal because that shape puts all cell processes and operatives into a cluster, affording high visibility and contact. By 1990 cells had come to be treated as foundation practices in JIT manufacturing, so much so that Harmon and Peterson, in their book, \"Reinventing the Factory\", included a section entitled, \"Cell: Fundamental Factory of the Future\". Cellular manufacturing was carried forward in the 1990s, when just-in-time was renamed lean manufacturing. Finally, when JIT/lean became widely attractive in the service sector, cellular concepts found their way into that realm; for example, Hyer and Wemmerlöv’s final chapter is devoted to office cells.\n\nCells are created in a workplace to facilitate flow. This is accomplished by bringing together operations (or machines, or people) involved in a processing sequence of a products natural flow and grouping them close to one another, distinct from other groups. This grouping is called a cell. These cells are used to improve many factors in a manufacturing setting by allowing \"one-piece flow\" to occur. An example of one-piece flow would be in the production of a metallic case part that arrives at the factory from the vendor in separate pieces, requiring assembly. First, the pieces would be moved from storage to the cell, where they would be welded together, then polished, then coated, and finally packaged. All of these steps would be completed in a single cell, so as to minimize various factors (called non-value-added processes/steps) such as time required to transport materials between steps. Some common formats of single cells are: the U-shape (good for communication and quick movement of workers), the straight line, or the L-shape. The number of workers inside these formations depend on current demand and can be modulated to increase or decrease production. For example, if a cell is normally occupied by two workers and demand is doubled, four workers should be placed in the cell. Similarly, if demand halves, one worker will occupy the cell. Since cells have a variety of differing equipment, it is therefore a requirement that any employee is skilled at multiple processes.While there exist many advantages to forming cells, there are some obvious benefits. It is quickly evident from observation of cells where inefficiencies lie, such as when an employee is too busy or relatively inactive. Resolving these inefficiencies can increase production and productivity by up to and above 100% in many cases. In addition to this, formation of cells consistently frees up floor space in the manufacturing/assembly environment (by having inventory only where it is absolutely required), improves safety in the work environment (due to smaller quantities of product/inventory being handled), improves morale (by imparting feelings of accomplishment and satisfaction in employees), reduces cost of inventory, and reducing inventory obsolescence.\n\nWhen formation of a cell would be too difficult, a simple principle is applied in order to improve efficiencies and flow, that is, to perform processes in a specific location and gather materials to that point at a rate dictated by an average of customer demand (this rate is called the \"takt\" time). This is referred to as the Pacemaker Process.\n\nDespite the advantages of designing for one-piece-flow, the formation of a cell must be carefully considered before implementation. Use of costly and complex equipment that tends to break down can cause massive delays in the production and will ruin output until they can be brought back online.\n\nThe short travel distances within cells serve to quicken the flows. Moreover, the compactness of a cell minimizes space that might allow build-ups of inventory between cell stations. To formalize that advantage, cells often have designed-in rules or physical devices that limit the amount of inventory between stations. Such a rule is known, in JIT/lean parlance, as kanban (from the Japanese), which establishes a maximum number of units allowable between a providing and a using work station. (Discussion and illustrations of cells in combinations with kanban are found in) The simplest form, kanban squares, are marked areas on floors or tables between work stations. The rule, applied to the producing station: \"If all squares are full, stop. If not, fill them up.\"\n\nAn office cell applies the same ideas: clusters of broadly trained cell-team members that, in concert, quickly handle all of the processing for a family of services or customers.\n\nA virtual cell is a variation in which all cell resources are not brought together in a physical space. In a virtual cell, as in the standard model, team members and their equipment are dedicated to a family of products or services. Although people and equipment are physically dispersed, as in a job shop, their narrow product focus aims for and achieves quick throughput, with all its advantages, just as if the equipment were moved into a cellular cluster. Lacking the visibility of physical cells, virtual cells may employ the discipline of kanban rules in order to tightly link the flows from process to process.\n\nA simple but rather complete description of cell implementation comes from a 1985 booklet of 96 pages by Kone Corp. in Finland, producer of elevators, escalators, and the like. Excerpts follow: \nIn order to implement cellular manufacturing, a number of steps must be performed. First, the parts to be made must be grouped by similarity (in design or manufacturing requirements) into families. Then a systematic analysis of each family must be performed; typically in the form of production flow analysis (PFA) for manufacturing families, or in the examination of design/product data for design families. This analysis can be time consuming and costly, but is important because a cell needs to be created for each family of parts. Clustering of machines and parts is one of the most popular production flow analysis methods. The algorithms for machine part grouping include Rank Order Clustering, Modified Rank Order Clustering, and Similarity coefficients. \n\nThere are also a number of mathematical models and algorithms to aid in planning a cellular manufacturing center, which take into account a variety of important variables such as, \"multiple plant locations, multi-market allocations with production planning and various part mix.\" Once these variables are determined with a given level of uncertainty, optimizations can be performed to minimize factors such as, \"total cost of holding, inter-cell material handling, external transportation, fixed cost for producing each part in each plant, machine and labor salaries.\"\n\nThe key to creating flow is continuous improvement to production processes. Upon implementation of cellular manufacturing, management commonly \"encounters strong resistance from production workers\". It will be beneficial to allow the change to cellular manufacturing to happen gradually.\n\nIt is also difficult to fight the desire to have some inventory on hand. It is tempting, since it would be easier to recover from an employee suddenly having to take sick leave. Unfortunately, in cellular manufacturing, it is important to remember the main tenants: \"You sink or swim together as a unit\" and that \"Inventory hides problems and inefficiencies.\" If the problems are not identified and subsequently resolved, the process will not improve.\n\nAnother common set of problems stems from the need to transfer materials between operations. These problems include, \"exceptional elements, number of voids, machine distances, bottleneck machines and parts, machine location and relocation, part routing, cell load variation, inter and intracellular material transferring, cell reconfiguring, dynamic part demands, and operation and completion times.\" These difficulties need to be considered and addressed to create efficient flow in cellular manufacturing.\n\nCellular manufacturing brings scattered processes together to form short, focused paths in concentrated physical space. So constructed, by logic a cell reduces flow time, flow distance, floor space, inventory, handling, scheduling transactions, and scrap and rework (the latter because of quick discovery of nonconformities). Moreover, cells lead to simplified, higher validity costing, since the costs of producing items are contained within the cell rather than scattered in distance and the passage of reporting time.\n\nCellular manufacturing facilitates both production and quality control. Cells that are underperforming in either volume or quality can be easily isolated and targeted for improvement. The segmentation of the production process allows problems to be easily located and it is more clear which parts are affected by the problem.\n\nThere are also a number of benefits for employees working in cellular manufacturing. The small cell structure improves group cohesiveness and scales the manufacturing process down to a more manageable level for the workers. Workers can more easily see problems or possible improvements within their own cells and tend to be more self-motivated to propose changes. Additionally, these improvements that are instigated by the workers themselves cause less and less need for management, so over time overhead costs can be reduced. Furthermore, the workers often are able to rotate between tasks within their cell, which offers variety in their work. This can further increase efficiency because work monotony has been linked to absenteeism and reduced production quality.\n\nCase studies in just-in-time and lean manufacturing are replete with impressive quantitative measures along those lines. For example, BAE Systems, Platform Solutions (Fort Wayne, Ind.), producing aircraft engine monitors and controls, implemented cells for 80 percent of production, reducing customer lead time 90 percent, work-in-process inventory 70 percent, space for one product family from 6,000 square feet to 1,200 square feet, while increasing product reliability 300 percent, multi-skilling the union-shop work force, and being designated an \"Industry Week\" Best Plant for the year 2000. By five years later, rework and scrap had been cut 50 percent, new product introduction cycles 60 percent, and transactions 90 percent, while also increasing inventory turns three-fold and service turn times 30 percent, and being awarded a Shingo Prize for the year 2005.\n\nIt appears to be difficult to isolate how much of those benefits accrue from cellular organization itself; among many case studies researched for this article few include attempts at isolating the benefits. One exception is the contention, at Steward, Inc. (Chattanooga, Tenn.), producing nickel zinc ferrite parts for electromagnetic interference suppression. According to case study authors, cells resulted in reductions of cycle time from 14 to 2 days, work-in-process inventories by 80 percent, finished inventories by 60 percent, lateness by 96 percent, and space by 56 percent.\n\nAnother cellular case study includes quantitative estimates of the extent to which cells contributed to overall benefits. At Hughes Ground Systems Group (Fullerton, Calif.), producing circuit cards for defense equipment, the first cell, which began as a pilot project with 15 volunteers, was launched in 1987. One month later a second cell began, and by 1992 all production employees, numbering about 150, had been integrated into seven cells. Prior to cells, circuit card cycle time, from kit release to shipment to the customer, had been 38 weeks. After the cells had taken over the full production sequence (mechanical assembly, wave solder, thermal cycle, and conformal coat), cycle time had fallen to 30.5 weeks, of which production manager John Reiss attributed 20 weeks to use of a \"WIP chart system\" by the cell teams and the other 10.5 weeks to the cellular organization itself. Later, when it seemed that the cells were overly large and cumbersome, cell sizes were shrunk by two-thirds, resulting in “micro cells” that cut cycle time by another 1.5 weeks. Finally, by adopting certain other improvements, cycle times had decreased to four weeks. Other improvements included reducing work-in-process inventory from 6 or 7 days to one day and percent defective from 0.04 to 0.01 Switching from a functional (job-shop) layout to cells often costs has a minus net cost, inasmuch as the cell reduces costs of transport, work-in-process and finished inventory, transactions, and rework. When large, heavy, expensive pieces of equipment (sometimes called “monuments” in lean lingo) must be moved, however, the initial costs can be high to the point where cells are not feasible.\n\nThere are a number of possible limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing. Some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a decrease in production flexibility. Cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced. Should the demand or necessary quantity decrease, the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements, which is a costly operation, and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2332078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2332078", "title": "Cigar box guitar", "text": "Cigar box guitar\n\nThe cigar box guitar is a simple chordophone that uses an empty cigar box as a resonator. The earliest had one or two strings; modern models typically have three or more. Generally, the strings are connected to the end of a broomstick or a 1 x 3 inch wood slate and to the cigar box resonator.\n\nCigars were packed in boxes, crates, and barrels as early as 1800, but the small boxes that we are familiar with today did not exist prior to around 1840. Until then, cigars were shipped in larger crates containing 100 or more per case. After 1840, cigar manufacturers started using smaller, more portable boxes with 20–50 cigars per box.\n\nTrace evidence of cigar box instruments exists from 1840 to the 1860s. The earliest known illustration of a cigar box instrument is an etching copyrighted in 1876 of two American Civil War soldiers at a campsite, one of whom is playing a cigar box fiddle. The etching was created by illustrator and artist Edwin Forbes, who, under the banner of \"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\", worked for the Union Army. The etching was included in Forbes's work \"Life Stories of the Great Army\". In the etching, the fiddle clearly shows the brand \"Figaro\" on the cigar box.\n\nIn addition to the etching, plans for a cigar box banjo were published by Daniel Carter Beard, co-founder of the Boy Scouts of America, in 1884 as part of \"Christmas Eve with Uncle Enos\". The plans, retitled \"How to Build an Uncle Enos Banjo\", were included in the 1890 edition of Beard's \"American Boy's Handy Book\" as supplementary material at the back of the book. These plans omitted the story but still showed a step-by-step description of a playable five-string fretless banjo made from a cigar box.\n\nIt would seem that the earliest cigar box instruments would be crude and primitive, but this is not always the case. According to William Jehle, curator of The Cigar Box Guitar Museum and the author of \"\", the museum acquired two cigar box fiddles built in 1886 and 1889 that seem very playable and well built. The 1886 fiddle was made for an 8-year-old boy and is certainly playable, but the 1889 fiddle has a well-carved neck and slotted violin headstock. The latter instrument was made for serious playing.\n\nCigar box guitars and fiddles were also important in the rise of jug bands and blues. As most of these performers were black Americans living in poverty, many could not afford a \"real\" instrument. Using these, along with the washtub bass (similar to the cigar box guitar), jug, washboard, and harmonica, black musicians performed blues during socializations.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s saw a resurgence of homemade musical instruments. Times were hard in the American South, and sitting on the front porch singing away the blues was a popular pastime. Musical instruments were beyond the means of most people, but with an old cigar box, a piece of broom handle and a couple of wires from the screen door, a guitar was born.\n\nA modern revival of these instruments (also known as the Cigar Box Guitar Revolution) has been gathering momentum with an increase in the number of cigar box guitar builders and performers. A loose-knit group of underground musicians tour the East Coast of the United States each summer under the banner \"Masters of the Cigar Box Guitar Tour.\" These musicians include Doctor Oakroot, Johnny Lowebow, Tomi-O and many others. A growing number of primitive luthiers are adding cigar box guitars to their items for sale. The Top cigar box guitar builders of today are Shane Speal, Mike Snowden and Peter Lake of Heavy Fog Guitars.\n\nThe modern revival is sometimes due to interest in jug bands and the DIY culture, as a cigar box is inexpensive in comparison with other factors, such as strings and construction time. Many modern cigar box guitar makers can be seen as practitioners of a type of lutherie and implement various personal touches, such as the addition of pickups and resonator cones.\nThe modern revival of cigar box guitars is documented in the 2008 film \"Songs Inside the Box\", which was shot primarily at the Cigar Box Guitar Extravaganza, an annual event held in Huntsville, Alabama.\nThe Cigar Box Guitar Museum, a free display dedicated to cigar box guitars, is located in Speal's Tavern, a small blues club in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. It is curated by cigar box guitarist Shane Speal and contains over 60 antique and modern cigar box guitars.\n\nMany different tunings can be used for cigar box guitars. Common tunings are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "376845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=376845", "title": "Cooper pair", "text": "Cooper pair\n\nIn condensed matter physics, a Cooper pair or BCS pair is a pair of electrons (or other fermions) bound together at low temperatures in a certain manner first described in 1956 by American physicist Leon Cooper. Cooper showed that an arbitrarily small attraction between electrons in a metal can cause a paired state of electrons to have a lower energy than the Fermi energy, which implies that the pair is bound. In conventional superconductors, this attraction is due to the electron–phonon interaction. The Cooper pair state is responsible for superconductivity, as described in the BCS theory developed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer for which they shared the 1972 Nobel Prize.\n\nAlthough Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation. An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative charge, but it also attracts the positive ions that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to electron–phonon interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.\n\nThe energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of 10 eV, and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons in Cooper pairs.\n\nThe electrons in a pair are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, paired electrons may still be many hundreds of nanometers apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance so that many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space. Electrons have spin-, so they are fermions, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) so it is a composite boson. This means the wave functions are symmetric under particle interchange. Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state, which is responsible for the phenomena of superconductivity.\n\nThe BCS theory is also applicable to other fermion systems, such as helium-3. Indeed, Cooper pairing is responsible for the superfluidity of helium-3 at low temperatures. It has also been recently demonstrated that a Cooper pair can comprise two bosons. Here, the pairing is supported by entanglement in an optical lattice.\n\nThe tendency for all the Cooper pairs in a body to \"condense\" into the same ground quantum state is responsible for the peculiar properties of superconductivity.\n\nCooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This \"gap to excitations\" leads to superconductivity, since small excitations such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.\nThe gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.\n\nR. A. Ogg, Jr., was first to suggest that electrons might act as pairs coupled by lattice vibrations in the material.\n\nThe theory of Cooper pairs is quite general and does not depend on the specific electron-phonon interaction. Condensed matter theorists have proposed pairing mechanisms based on other attractive interactions such as electron–exciton interactions or electron–plasmon interactions. Currently, none of these other pairing interactions has been observed in any material.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Cooper pairing does not involve individual electrons pairing up to form \"quasi-bosons\". The paired states are energetically favored, and electrons go in and out of those states preferentially. This is a fine distinction that John Bardeen makes:\n\nThe mathematical description of the second-order coherence involved here is given by Yang.\n\n"}

It teaches the concept of gods, heavens and rebirths in its Saṃsāra doctrine, but it considers none of these gods as a creator. Buddhism posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misconstrued to be a creator. Buddhist ontology follows the doctrine of Dependent Origination, whereby all phenomena arise in dependence on other phenomena, hence no primal unmoved mover could be acknowledged or discerned.\n\nAccording to Buddhologist Richard Hayes, the early Buddhist Nikaya literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god \"primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view\". In these texts the Buddha is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.\n\nCiting the \"Devadaha Sutta\" (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, \"while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God.\"\n\nIn the Tittha sutta (A.N. 3.61), the Buddha while describing the three heretical doctrines, mentions Issaranimmāṇavada (doctrine of the divine creation) as one of those three: \nBuddha further explains this doctrine and refutes it as a false belief:\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, Buddhism assumes that the universe has no ultimate beginning to it, and thus sees no need for a creator God. In the early texts of Buddhism, the nearest term to this concept is \"Great Brahma\" (\"MahaBrahma\") such as in \"Digha Nikaya\" 1.18. However \"[w]hile being kind and compassionate, none of the \"brahmās\" are world-creators.\"\n\nAccording to Harvey, \"[a]fter a long period, the three lowest form heavens appear, and a Streaming Radiance god dies and is reborn there as a Great Brahmā.\" Then \"other Streaming Radiance gods die and happen to be reborn, due to their karma, as his ministers and retinue.\" The retinue erroneously believes Mahabrahma created them. When one of these ministers \"eventually dies and is reborn as a human, he develops the power to remember his previous life, and consequently teaches that Great Brahmā is the eternal creator of all beings.\"\n\nThe 5th-century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu argued that a creator's singular identity is incompatible with creating the world in his Abhidharmakosha.\n\nThe Chinese monk Xuanzang (fl. c. 602–664) studied Buddhism in India during the seventh century, staying at Nalanda. There, he studied the Yogacara teachings passed down from Asanga and Vasubandhu and taught to him by the abbot Śīlabhadra. In his work \"Cheng Weishi Lun\" (Skt. \"Vijñāptimātratāsiddhi śāstra\"), Xuanzang refutes a \"Great Lord\" or Great Brahmā doctrine:\nThe 7th-century Buddhist scholar Dharmakīrti advances a number of arguments against the existence of a creator god in his \"Pramāṇavārtika\", following in the footsteps of Vasubandhu. Later Mahayana scholars such as Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla continued this tradition.\n\nThe 11th-century Buddhist philosopher Ratnakīrti at the then university at Vikramashila (now Bhagalpur, Bihar) criticized the arguments for the existence of God-like being called Isvara, that emerged in the Navya-Nyaya sub-school of Hinduism, in his “Refutation of Arguments Establishing Īśvara” (Īśvara-sādhana-dūṣaṇa). These arguments are similar to those used by other sub-schools of Hinduism and Jainism that questioned the Navya-Nyaya theory of dualistic creator.\n\n"}

For instance, the proposition \"zero belongs to the set { 1 }\" is regarded as simply false; while the proposition \"one belongs to the set { 1 }\" is regarded as simply true. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be \"more or less\" true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider \"My coffee is hot\".\n\nIn mathematics, this idea can be developed in terms of fuzzy logic. In computer science, it has found application in artificial intelligence.

{"id": "40776948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40776948", "title": "Derived scheme", "text": "Derived scheme\n\nIn algebraic geometry, a derived scheme is a pair formula_1 consisting of a topological space \"X\" and a sheaf formula_2 of commutative ring spectra on \"X\" such that (1) the pair formula_3 is a scheme and (2) formula_4 is a quasi-coherent formula_5-module. The notion gives a homotopy-theoretic generalization of a scheme.\n\nA derived stack is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme.\n\nOver a field of characteristic zero, the theory is equivalent to that of a differential graded scheme. By definition, a differential graded scheme is obtained by gluing affine differential graded schemes, with respect to étale topology. It was introduced by Maxim Kontsevich \"as the first approach to derived algebraic geometry.\" and was developed further by Mikhail Kapranov and Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine.\n\nJust as affine algebraic geometry is equivalent (in categorical sense) to the theory of commutative rings (commonly called commutative algebra), affine derived algebraic geometry over characteristic zero is equivalent to the theory of commutative differential graded rings. One of the main example of derived schemes comes from the derived intersection of subschemes of a scheme, giving the Koszul complex. For example, let formula_6, then we can get a derived scheme formula_7 where\nis the étale spectrum. Since we can construct a resolution\nthe derived ring formula_10 is the koszul complex formula_11. The truncation of this derived scheme to amplitude formula_12 provides a classical model motivating derived algebraic geometry. Notice that if we have a projective scheme\nwhere formula_14 we can construct the derived scheme formula_15 where\nwith amplitude formula_12\n\nLet formula_18 be a fixed differential graded algebra defined over a field of characteristic formula_19. Then a formula_20-differential graded algebra formula_21 is called semi-free if the following conditions hold:\nIt turns out that every formula_20 differential graded algebra admits a surjective quasi-isomorphism from a semi-free formula_18 differential graded algebra, called a semi-free resolution. These are unique up to homotopy equivalence in a suitable model category. The (relative) cotangent complex of an formula_18-differential graded algebra formula_33 can be constructed using a semi-free resolution formula_34: it is defined as\nMany examples can be constructed by taking the algebra formula_36 representing a variety over a field of characteristic 0, finding a presentation of formula_37 as a quotient of a polynomial algebra and taking the Koszul complex associated to this presentation. The Koszul complex acts as a semi-free resolution of the differential graded algebra formula_38 where formula_39 is the graded algebra with the non-trivial graded piece in degree 0.\n\nThe cotangent complex of a hypersurface formula_40 can easily be computed: since we have the dga formula_41 representing the derived enhancement of formula_42, we can compute the cotangent complex as\nwhere formula_44 and formula_45 is the usual universal derivation. If we take a complete intersection, then the koszul complex\nis quasi-isomorphic to the complex\nThis implies we can construct the cotangent complex of the derived ring formula_48 as the tensor product of the cotangent complex above for each formula_49.\n\nPlease note that the cotangent complex in the context of derived geometry differs from the cotangent complex of classical schemes. Namely, if there was a singularity in the hypersurface defined by formula_50 then the cotangent complex would have infinite amplitude. These observations provide motivation for the hidden smoothness philosophy of derived geometry since we are now working with a complex of finite length.\n\nGiven a polynomial function formula_51, then consider the (homotopy) pullback diagram\nwhere the bottom arrow is the inclusion of a point at the origin. Then, the derived scheme formula_53 has tangent complex at formula_54 is given by the morphism\nwhere the complex is of amplitude formula_12. Notice that the tangent space can be recovered using formula_57 and the formula_58 measures how far away formula_59 is from being a smooth point.\nGiven a stack formula_60 there is a nice description for the tangent complex:\nIf the morphism is not injective, the formula_58 measures again how singular the space is. In addition, the euler characteristic of this complex yields the correct (virtual) dimension of the quotient stack.\n\nIn particular, if we look at the moduli stack of principal formula_63-bundles, then the tangent complex is just formula_64.\n\nDerived schemes can be used for analyzing topological properties of affine varieties. For example, consider a smooth affine variety formula_65. If we take a regular function formula_66 and consider the section of formula_67\nThen, we can take the derived pullback diagram\nwhere formula_19 is the zero section, constructing a derived critical locus of the regular function formula_50.\n\nConsider the affine variety\nand the regular function given by formula_74. Then,\nwhere we treat the last two coordinates as formula_76. The derived critical locus is then the derived scheme\nNote that since the left term in the derived intersection is a complete intersection, we can compute a complex representing the derived ring as\nwhere formula_79 is the koszul complex.\nConsider a smooth function formula_66 where formula_81 is smooth. The derived enhancement of formula_82, the derived critical locus, is given by the differential graded scheme formula_83 where the underlying graded ring are the polyvector fields\nand the differential formula_85 is defined by contraction by formula_86.\n\nFor example, if formula_87 is given by formula_74 we have the complex\nrepresenting the derived enhancement of formula_82.\n\n"}
{"id": "57979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57979", "title": "Disarmament", "text": "Disarmament\n\nDisarmament is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing weapons. Disarmament generally refers to a country's military or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear arms. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”\n\nBefore World War I at the Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907 government delegations debated about disarmament and the creation of an international court with binding powers. The court was considered necessary because it was understood that nation-states could not disarm into a vacuum. After the war revulsion at the futility and tremendous cost of the war was widespread. A commonly held belief was that the cause of the war had been the escalating buildup of armaments in the previous half century among the great powers (see Anglo-German naval arms race). Although the Treaty of Versailles effectively disarmed Germany, a clause was inserted that called on all the great powers to likewise progressively disarm over a period of time. The newly formed League of Nations made this an explicit goal in the covenant of the league, which committed its signatories to reduce armaments ‘to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations’.\n\nOne of the earliest successful achievements in disarmament was obtained with the Washington Naval Treaty. Signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, it prevented the continued construction of capital ships and limited ships of other classification to under 10,000 tons displacement. The size of the three country's navies (the Royal Navy, United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy) was set at the ratio 5-5-3.\n\nIn 1921 the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments was set up by the League of Nations to explore possibilities for disarmament. Proposals ranged from abolishing chemical warfare and strategic bombing to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks. A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the British, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police the empire.\nA further commission in 1926, set up to explore the possibilities for the reduction of army size, met similar difficulties, prompting the French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand and US Secretary of State Frank Kellogg to draft a treaty known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which denounced war of aggression. Although there were 65 signatories to the pact, it achieved nothing, as it set out no guidelines for action in the event of a war.\n\nA final attempt was made at the Geneva Disarmament Conference from 1932–37, chaired by former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. Germany demanded the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the granting of military parity with the other powers, while France was determined to keep Germany demilitarised for its own security. Meanwhile, the British and Americans were not willing to offer France security commitments in exchange for conciliation with Germany. The talks broke down in 1933, when Adolf Hitler withdrew Germany from the conference.\n\nNuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament held an inaugural public meeting at Central Hall, Westminster, on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at Downing Street.\n\nCND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention. The first Aldermaston March was organised by the CND and took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons. The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.\n\nIn 1961, US President John F. Kennedy gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US \"intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved.\" He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:\n\nMajor nuclear disarmament groups include Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Greenpeace and International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. There have been many large anti-nuclear demonstrations and protests. On June 12, 1982, one million people demonstrated in New York City's Central Park against nuclear weapons and for an end to the cold war arms race. It was the largest anti-nuclear protest and the largest political demonstration in American history.\n\n\n\nIn his definition of \"disarmament\", David Carlton writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, \"But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention.\" He also notes, \"Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control.\"\n\nThe book by Seymour Melman, \"Inspection for Disarmament\", addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. \n\nSpecific references:\n\nGeneral references:\n\n\n"}

Such benefits accrue to all living organisms, including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance to society that ecological goods and services provide for health, social, cultural, and economic needs. \n\nExamples of ecological goods include clean air, and abundant fresh water. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, seed dispersal, greenhouse gas mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of public goods.\n\nThe concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore land use managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.\n\nA market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners. Some believe that public lands alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the \"polluter pays\" to the \"beneficiary pays\". \n\nFinancial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, market-based instruments, and tax rebates.\n\nAccording to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment project, biodiversity is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services. Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as biological control and genetic resources. However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing. \n\nThe following policy tools can be used to ensure production of ecological goods and services: (in French)\n\n\n\n"}

Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the Medal of Honor have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.\n\nSuch an act can be survivable: In World War II, US Marine Jack Lucas, in the Battle of Iwo Jima, placed two grenades under his steel M1 Helmet and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near Sangin in Afghanistan British Royal Marine Matthew Croucher used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and that and his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, US Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim.\n\n\"Falling on a grenade\" is also used colloquially in non-military contexts to indicate individual acceptance of a personally harmful or sacrificial task in an effort to protect a larger group; during a scandal, corporate leaders or politicians who attempt to draw negative attention away from their company or party by pleading guilt, publicly admitting culpability and drawing condemnation on themselves (at the cost of their freedom or career) are often said to have \"fallen on a grenade\". \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11304983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11304983", "title": "Gliding flight", "text": "Gliding flight\n\nGliding flight is heavier-than-air flight without the use of thrust; the term volplaning also refers to this mode of flight in animals. It is employed by gliding animals and by aircraft such as gliders. This mode of flight involves flying a significant distance horizontally compared to its descent and therefore can be distinguished from a mostly straight downward descent like with a round parachute.\n\nAlthough the human application of gliding flight usually refers to aircraft designed for this purpose, most powered aircraft are capable of gliding without engine power. As with sustained flight, gliding generally requires the application of an airfoil, such as the wings on aircraft or birds, or the gliding membrane of a gliding possum. However, gliding can be achieved with a flat (uncambered) wing, as with a simple paper plane, or even with card-throwing. However, some aircraft with lifting bodies and animals such as the flying snake can achieve gliding flight without any wings by creating a flattened surface underneath.\n\nMost winged aircraft can glide to some extent, but there are several types of aircraft designed to glide:\n\nThe main human application is currently recreational, though during the Second World War military gliders were used for carrying troops and equipment into battle. The types of aircraft that are used for sport and recreation are classified as gliders (sailplanes), hang gliders and paragliders. These two latter types are often foot-launched. The design of all three types enables them to repeatedly climb using rising air and then to glide before finding the next source of lift. When done in gliders (sailplanes), the sport is known as gliding and sometimes as soaring. For foot-launched aircraft, it is known as hang gliding and paragliding. Radio-controlled gliders with fixed wings are also soared by enthusiasts.\n\nIn addition to motor gliders, some powered aircraft are designed for routine glides during part of their flight; usually when landing after a period of a powered flight. These include:\n\nSome aircraft are not designed to glide except in an emergency, such as engine failure. See list of airline flights that required gliding flight. Gliding in a helicopter is called autorotation.\n\nA number of animals have separately evolved gliding many times, without any single ancestor. Birds in particular use gliding flight to minimise their use of energy. Large birds are notably adept at gliding, including:\n\nLike recreational aircraft, birds can alternate periods of gliding with periods of soaring in rising air, and so spend a considerable time airborne with a minimal expenditure of energy. The great frigatebird in particular is capable of continuous flights up to several weeks.\n\nTo assist gliding, some mammals have evolved a structure called the patagium. This is a membranous structure found stretched between a range of body parts. It is most highly developed in bats. For similar reasons to birds, bats can glide efficiently. In bats, the skin forming the surface of the wing is an extension of the skin of the abdomen that runs to the tip of each digit, uniting the forelimb with the body. The patagium of a bat has four distinct parts:\n\nOther mammals such as gliding possums and flying squirrels also glide using a patagium, but with much poorer efficiency than bats. They cannot gain height. The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its limbs to expose the gliding membranes, usually to get from tree to tree in rainforests as an efficient means of both locating food and evading predators. This form of arboreal locomotion, is common in tropical regions such as Borneo and Australia, where the trees are tall and widely spaced.\n\nIn flying squirrels, the patagium stretches from the fore- to the hind-limbs along the length of each side of the torso. In the sugar glider, the patagia extend between the fifth finger of each hand to the first toe of each foot. This creates an aerofoil enabling them to glide 50 metres or more. This gliding flight is regulated by changing the curvature of the membrane or moving the legs and tail.\n\nIn addition to mammals and birds, other animals notably flying fish, flying snakes, flying frogs and flying squid also glide.\nThe flights of flying fish are typically around 50 meters (160 ft), though they can use updrafts at the leading edge of waves to cover distances of up to . To glide upward out of the water, a flying fish moves its tail up to 70 times per second. It then spreads its pectoral fins and tilts them slightly upward to provide lift. At the end of a glide, it folds its pectoral fins to re-enter the sea, or drops its tail into the water to push against the water to lift itself for another glide, possibly changing direction. The curved profile of the \"wing\" is comparable to the aerodynamic shape of a bird wing. The fish is able to increase its time in the air by flying straight into or at an angle to the direction of updrafts created by a combination of air and ocean currents.\n\nSnakes of the genus \"Chrysopelea\" are also known by the common name \"flying snake\". Before launching from a branch, the snake makes a J-shape bend. After thrusting its body up and away from the tree, it sucks in its abdomen and flaring out its ribs to turn its body into a \"pseudo concave wing\", all the while making a continual serpentine motion of lateral undulation parallel to the ground to stabilise its direction in mid-air in order to land safely. Flying snakes are able to glide better than flying squirrels and other gliding animals, despite the lack of limbs, wings, or any other wing-like projections, gliding through the forest and jungle it inhabits with the distance being as great as 100 m. Their destination is mostly predicted by ballistics; however, they can exercise some in-flight attitude control by \"slithering\" in the air.\n\nGliding flight has evolved independently among 3,400 species of frogs from both New World (Hylidae) and Old World (Rhacophoridae) families. This parallel evolution is seen as an adaptation to their life in trees, high above the ground. Characteristics of the Old World species include \"enlarged hands and feet, full webbing between all fingers and toes, lateral skin flaps on the arms and legs\n\nThree principal forces act on aircraft and animals when gliding:\n\nAs the aircraft or animal descends, the air moving over the wings generates lift. The lift force acts slightly forward of vertical because it is created at right angles to the airflow which comes from slightly below as the glider descends, see angle of attack. This horizontal component of lift is enough to overcome drag and allows the glider to accelerate forward. Even though the weight causes the aircraft to descend, if the air is rising faster than the sink rate, there will be a gain of altitude.\n\nThe lift-to-drag ratio, or \"L/D ratio\", is the amount of lift generated by a wing or vehicle, divided by the drag it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favourable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's needed lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better fuel economy and climb performance.\n\nThe effect of airspeed on the rate of descent can be depicted by a polar curve. These curves show the airspeed where minimum sink can be achieved and the airspeed with the best L/D ratio. The curve is an inverted U-shape. As speeds reduce the amount of lift falls rapidly around the stalling speed. The peak of the 'U' is at minimum drag.\n\nAs lift and drag are both proportional to the coefficient of Lift and Drag respectively multiplied by the same factor (1/2 ρ vS), the L/D ratio can be simplified to the Coefficient of lift divided by the coefficient of drag or Cl/Cd, and since both are proportional to the airspeed, the ratio of L/D or Cl/Cd is then typically plotted against angle of attack.\n\nInduced drag is caused by the generation of lift by the wing. Lift generated by a wing is perpendicular to the relative wind, but since wings typically fly at some small angle of attack, this means that a component of the force is directed to the rear. The rearward component of this force (parallel with the relative wind) is seen as drag. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the drag graph, the left side of the U.\n\nProfile drag is caused by air hitting the wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This form of drag, also known as wind resistance, varies with the square of speed (see drag equation). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the drag graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by reducing cross section and streamlining.\nAs lift increases steadily until the critical angle, it is normally the point where the combined drag is at its lowest, that the wing or aircraft is performing at its best L/D.\n\nDesigners will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen cruising speed for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in aeronautical engineering, the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high angle of attack and a gentle stall are also important.\n\nMinimising drag is of particular interest in the design and operation of high performance glider (sailplane)s, the largest of which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1, though many others have a lower performance; 25:1 being considered adequate for training use.\n\nWhen flown at a constant speed in still air a glider moves forwards a certain distance for a certain distance downwards. The ratio of the distance forwards to downwards is called the \"glide ratio\". The glide ratio (E) is numerically equal to the lift-to-drag ratio under these conditions; but is not necessarily equal during other manoeuvres, especially if speed is not constant. A glider's glide ratio varies with airspeed, but there is a maximum value which is frequently quoted. Glide ratio usually varies little with vehicle loading; a heavier vehicle glides faster, but nearly maintains its glide ratio.\nGlide ratio (or \"finesse\") is the cotangent of the downward angle, the \"glide angle\" (γ). Alternatively it is also the forward speed divided by sink speed (unpowered aircraft):\n\n\"Glide number\" (ε) is the reciprocal of glide ratio but sometime it's confused.\n\nAlthough the best glide ratio is important when measuring the performance of a gliding aircraft, its glide ratio at a range of speeds also determines its success (see article on gliding).\n\nPilots sometimes fly at the aircraft's best L/D by precisely controlling airspeed and smoothly operating the controls to reduce drag. However the strength of the likely next lift, minimising the time spent in strongly sinking air and the strength of the wind also affects the optimal speed to fly. Pilots fly faster to get quickly through sinking air, and when heading into wind to optimise the glide angle relative to the ground. To achieve higher speed across country, gliders (sailplanes) are often loaded with water ballast to increase the airspeed and so reach the next area of lift sooner. This has little effect on the glide angle since the increases in the rate of sink and in the airspeed remain in proportion and thus the heavier aircraft achieves optimal L/D at a higher airspeed. If the areas of lift are strong on the day, the benefits of ballast outweigh the slower rate of climb.\n\nIf the air is rising faster than the rate of sink, the aircraft will climb. At lower speeds an aircraft may have a worse glide ratio but it will also have a lower rate of sink. A low airspeed also improves its ability to turn tightly in centre of the rising air where the rate of ascent is greatest. A sink rate of approximately 1.0 m/s is the most that a practical hang glider or paraglider could have before it would limit the occasions that a climb was possible to only when there was strongly rising air. Gliders (sailplanes) have minimum sink rates of between 0.4 and 0.6 m/s depending on the class. Aircraft such as airliners may have a better glide ratio than a hang glider, but would rarely be able to thermal because of their much higher forward speed and their much higher sink rate. (Note that the Boeing 767 in the Gimli Glider incident achieved a glide ratio of only 12:1.)\n\nThe loss of height can be measured at several speeds and plotted on a \"polar curve\" to calculate the best speed to fly in various conditions, such as when flying into wind or when in sinking air. Other polar curves can be measured after loading the glider with water ballast. As mass increases, the best glide ratio is achieved at higher speeds. (The glide ratio is not increased.)\n\nSoaring animals and aircraft may alternate glides with periods of soaring in rising air. Five principal types of lift are used: thermals, ridge lift, lee waves, convergences and dynamic soaring. Dynamic soaring is used predominately by birds, and some model aircraft, though it has also been achieved on rare occasions by piloted aircraft.\n\nExamples of soaring flight by birds are the use of:\n\nFor humans, soaring is the basis for three air sports: gliding, hang gliding and paragliding.\n\n"}

His brothers include the writer Peter and composer Heinrich. His grandfather was the folklorist Otto Sutermeister. A minister's son, Hans Martin studied theology in Germany, changing to medicine at University of Basel just before completing his degree. After his promotion with his uncle Hans Hunziker in 1941, Sutermeister published, under the pseudonym “Hans Moehrlen” (following the surname of his great-grandfather Christophe Moehrlen), an autobiographical novella about his life as a bachelor. The novella describes his philosophical change of direction towards a monist view of love and happiness, inspired by natural science; remarkably is its heartedness in times of war. In the following years, Sutermeister published a series on neopositivist medical thought. He was especially interested in psychosomatic medicine and music psychology. For example, according to him, “swing music is restful” because the brain becomes fatigued when it is worked too hard, as in acquiring knowledge of new facts. Both students and business men can benefit by such music … the best way to rest the brain after such fatigue is to “regress” to more basic or primitive forms of thought and feeling.\n\nDuring World War II, he worked for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as a physician at the Swiss border. After the war he wrote for medical journals and was an instructor in psychophysiology at the Volkshochschule (Folk high school) in Bern. In 1945, he opened his first a family medical practice in Bern.\n\nIn order to get a venia legendi in History of Medicine and Medical Psychology (Psychosomatics), Sutermeister successively deposited, at the beginning of the 1950s, three post-doctoral theses at the Medical Faculty of the University of Berne:\n\n\nSutermeister was in contact with the medical historian Erich Hintzsche particularly because of his work \"Schiller as physician\", and he participated in a seminar on medical history 1953 in Lugano. In a letter to Hintzsche, Henry E. Sigerist described Sutermeister's review, published in 1955 as Volume 13 of the \"Berne contributions to the history of medicine and natural sciences\", as “a very nice work … that is interesting even to literary historians.” The assessor Jakob Klaesi recommended to the Dean of the Faculty Bernhard Walthard to allow Sutermeister's habilitation allow for the government to issue Sutermeister's habilitation as a lecturer in Medicine history and Psychosomatic medicine. Hintzsche, however, who decided jointly, rejected his habilitation.\n\nHe joined the Ring of Independents political party and began his political career in the legislature of the Canton of Bern. From 1967 to 1971 he served as a member of the municipal executive, as well as director of the city's schools. As school director, he promoted comprehensive schools. Although he had a reputation as a progressive within his party, he also stirred some concern both inside and outside the party by fiercely criticizing \"The Little Red Schoolbook\", an educational manifesto deriving from the 1968 student protest movement that urged students to reject societal norms. \"Der Spiegel\" quoted his warning to all educators: We will not permit our youth, who are today still healthy, and our freedom-based Western culture, to be undermined by such softening-up tactics, which are clearly controlled from the East, and made 'Ready for conquest' by Communism.\nand added that some schools banned the book; Radio Bern canceled a broadcast on it; and bookstores canceled orders; the city authorities determined that the book was not seditious, but with police assurance that they had the power to do so, banned it as posing a danger to minors. His actions revealed latent attitudinal and generational divisions within the party, and he was not re-elected in 1971.\n\nIn 1972, he opened his new family medical practice in Basel.\n\nIn the 1960s, Sutermeister became interested in forensic pathology, and began to involve himself in investigating and attempting to right miscarriages of justice. He traveled widely and wrote analyses on false recognition, intimidation by prison inmates, uncritical acceptance of expert testimony, suggestibility and emotionalism in jurors and psychological errors by judges. His book \"Summa Iniuria\", which treats hundreds of cases, is one of the most thorough German-language works in the field. He concerned himself particularly with the case of Pierre Jaccoud, whom he was convinced had been wrongly convicted of murdering Charles Zumbach based on faulty forensic work. At one point Pierre Hegg, the head of the police criminological laboratory, sued him for defamation. His efforts on behalf of Jaccoud made him a prominent and effective opponent of courtroom injustice, and he went so far as to assemble the funds to hire Horace Mastronardi and other lawyers to appeal Jaccoud's conviction. Despite his efforts, the case was never reopened.\n\nThe criminal law expert Karl Peters puts Sutermeister's \"Summa iniuria\" in the context of the earlier works of Erich Sello, Max Alsberg, Albert Hellwig, Max Hirschberg and Heinrich Jagusch and considers him as a \"committed fighters for a constitutionally protected Criminal Justice\".\n\nThe bibliography of Hans Martin Sutermeister includes a fictional novel and around 150 scientific articles, essays and books, some of them Investigative journalism written by the Swiss writer Hans Martin Sutermeister, pen name Hans Moehrlen (1907–1977). Sutermeister was a prolific writer on topics related to psychosomatic medicine, music psychology and history of medicine as well as contemporary Swiss society and cultural criticism, whom Karl Peters in 2008 declared \"a fierce fighter for justice.\"\n\nSutermeister is best remembered for his contradictory political as a both-left-and-rightwing libertarian-authoritarian presence in local media. Every line of work that he has written since 1942 seeming, directly or indirectly, in favour of a monist worldview. To that end, Sutermeister used his scientific writing to defend his political convictions, as shown in several book reviews. He first achieved acclaim with his non–fictional books from \"Psychologie und Weltanschauung\" (1944) to \"Schiller als Arzt\" (1955) and cemented his place in local history as one of the greatest Swiss pamphletists with the publication of \"\" shortly before his death.\n\nSutermeister wrote non-fiction—including book reviews, editorials, and investigative journalism—for a variety of Swiss periodicals, mainly medical journals. He particularly wrote a book-length investigation of comprehensive schools in Switzerland and another of miscarriages of justice in the form of \"\", a retrospective of criminal justice mainly in Switzerland and Germany.\n\nNo attempts have been made until now to comprehensively collect the entirety of his miscellany.\n\nSutermeister composed one novel, \"Zwischen zwei Welten\", which is autobiographical; it was inspired by his period working as a student during wartime; it records his experiences living and tramping in a town where he later finished his medical studies; the names are partially fictionalized:\n\n\nAmong his Non-fiction books are the writings of his Neopositivist period (1942–1945) which culminates in his article \"Der Neopositivismus als neue Einheitsweltanschauung\" (1945; see below): \n\nDoctoral dissertation:\n\nAt the University of Berne, Sutermeister presented subsequently three Habilitation theses, which were all rejected:\n\nSutermeister wrote dozens of essays and book reviews. His insights into history of medicine, literature, and politics (defending in particular anti-fascist, liberal socialist, freethought and somehow anti-communist ideas) during the following years. Since his death, many essays have disappeared, with the first attempt at a comprehensive collection being this list. Some of his essays, mainly during his time as member of the Ring of Independents political party, took the form of pamphlets and were published and distributed (by himself) independently.\n\nThe following list contains the articles which are both registered in PubMed and can be considered as outstanding because of their scope, theme range or length:\n\nVolume 40, Issue 6, 8 February 1951, Pages 121-122. \n\nAs a member of the so–called bernese nonconformists, Sutermeister spoke in the Junkere 37 (sometimes called Speakers' Corner of Bern). Some fragments of these manifestations are traceable in the \"Nonkonformismus Archiv Fredi Lerch\".\n\nWhile Sutermeister was not known for his aesthetic work, he did compose two “little waltz” and a poem:\n\n\nHans Martin married Ingeborg Marie Schulzke, with whom he had three daughters.\n\n"}

{"id": "4395648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4395648", "title": "Irenicism", "text": "Irenicism\n\nIrenicism in Christian theology refers to attempts to unify Christian apologetical systems by using reason as an essential attribute. The word is derived from the Greek word \"ειρήνη (eirene)\" meaning peace. It is a concept related to natural theology and opposed to polemicism (war-like argumentation) being rooted in the ideals of pacifism. Those who affiliate themselves with irenicism identify the importance of unity in the Christian church, and declare the common bond between all Christians under Christ.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus was a Christian humanist and reformer, in the sense of checking clerical abuses, honoring inner piety, considering reason as meaningful in theology as in other ways. He also promoted the notion that Christianity must remain under one church, both theologically and literally; under the body of the Catholic Church. Since his time, irenicism has postulated removing conflicts between different Christian creeds by way of mediation and gradual amalgamation of theological differences. Erasmus wrote extensively on topics related generally to peace, and an irenic approach is part of the texture of his thought, both on theology and in relation to politics:\n\nDespite the frequency and severity of polemics directed against him, Erasmus continued ... to practice a kind of discourse that is critical and ironic, yet modest and irenic. \n\nCertain important irenic contributions from Erasmus helped to further the humanist consideration of themes of peace and religious conciliation; these included the \"Inquisitio de fide\" (1524), arguing against the papal opinion that Martin Luther was a heretic, and \"De sarcienda ecclesiae concordia\" (1533). Erasmus had close associates sharing his views (Julius von Pflug, Christoph von Stadion, and Jakob Ziegler), and was followed on the Catholic side by George Cassander and Georg Witzel. \n\nThe influence of Erasmus was, however, limited, by the virtual exclusion of his works from countries such as France, from 1525, at least in the open; though they did appear in numerous forms and translations. James Hutton speaks of \"the surreptitious manner in which Erasmus' peace propaganda reached the French public.\"\n\nFranciscus Junius published in 1593 \"Le paisible Chrestien\" arguing for religious tolerance and Ecumenism. He addressed Philip II of Spain, using arguments taken from the French \"politique\" statesman Michel de l'Hôpital and reformer Sebastian Castellio.\n\nIrenic movements were influential in the 17th century, and irenicism, for example in the form of Gottfried Leibniz's efforts to reunite Catholics and Protestants, is in some ways a forerunner to the more modern ecumenical movements.\n\nThe 1589 \"Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots\" by Henry Constable proved influential, for example on Christopher Potter and William Forbes. Richard Montagu admired Cassander and Andreas Fricius. The 1628 \"Syllabus aliquot synodorum\" was a bibliography of the literature of religious concord, compiled by Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul decades earlier, and seen into print by Hugo Grotius using the pseudonym \"Theodosius Irenaeus,\" with a preface by Matthias Bernegger. \n\nIt was typical enough, however, for moderate and even irenical writers on the Catholic side to find in this period that their arguments were turned back against Catholicism. This style of arguing developed in England from Thomas Bell and particularly Thomas Morton. It led to Thomas James mining Marcantonio de Dominis and Paolo Sarpi, and making efforts to claim Witzel for the Protestant tradition; to the arguments of Gallicanism being welcomed but also treated as particularly insidious; and an irenist such as Francis a Sancta Clara being attacked strongly by firm Calvinists. The handful of Protestant writers who were convinced in their irenic approach to Catholics included William Covell and Thomas Dove.\n\nJames I of England thought that the Bible translation he commissioned might effect some reconciliation between the English Protestant religious factions, and prove an \"irenicon\". The Greek ἐιρηνικόν (\"eirenikon\") or peace proposal is also seen as \"irenicum\" in its Latin version.\n\nAn irenic literature developed, relating to divisions within Protestantism, particularly in the twenty years after the Peace of Westphalia. Examples marked out by title are:\n\n\nIsaac Newton wrote an \"Irenicum\" (unpublished manuscript); it supported a latitudinarian position in theology, derived from a review of church history.\n\nAnthony Milton writes:\n\n[Ecumenical historians] have tended to assume the existence of an irenical 'essentialism' in which the association of Christian unity with peace, toleration and ecumenism is presupposed. [...] In fact, most thinkers of this period accepted that religious unity was a good idea, in the same way that they believed that sin was a bad idea. The problem was that, of course, different people wanted irenicism on different terms. [...] Different interpretations of irenicism could have direct political implications, making the rhetoric of Christian unity an important tool in the political conflicts of the period.\n\nIt is in that light that he comments on the irenists' succession: Erasmus, Cassander, Jacob Acontius, Grotius, then John Dury, who spent much time on a proposed reconciliation of Lutherans and Calvinists.\n\n\"Irenical\" has become a commonly used adjective to design an idealist and pacific conception, such as the democratic peace theory. \n\n\"False irenicism\" or \"false eirenism\" is an expression used in certain 20th-century documents of the Catholic Church to criticize attempts at ecumenism that would allow Catholic doctrine to be distorted or clouded. Documents using the term include the encyclical \"Humani generis\", promulgated by Pope Pius XII in 1950, the Second Vatican Council's 1964 Decree on Ecumenism, \"Unitatis Redintegratio,\" and Pope John Paul II's 1984 post-synodal apostolic exhortation, \"Reconciliatio et paenitentia\".\n\n"}

This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing or saying a specific word out loud. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if \"there's no way it is an actual word\".\n\nThe phenomenon is often grouped with \"déjà vu\" and \"presque vu\", or \"tip of the tongue\".\n\nTheoretically, as seen below, a \"jamais vu\" feeling in a sufferer of a delirious disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in Capgras delusion, in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false double or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as depersonalisation; hence, \"jamais vus\" of oneself, or of the very \"reality of reality\", are termed depersonalization and derealization, respectively.\n\nA study by Chris Moulin of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out \"door\" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of \"jamais vu\", such as beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic \"jamais vu\".\n\n\"Jamais vu\" can be caused by epileptic seizures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11083126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11083126", "title": "Jungian archetypes", "text": "Jungian archetypes\n\nIn Jungian psychology, archetypes are highly developed elements of the collective unconscious. The existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by using story, art, myths, religions, or dreams. Carl Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the collective unconscious and are the psychic counterpart of instinct. They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world. They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.\n\nIn theory, Jungian archetypes refer to unclear underlying forms or the \"archetypes-as-such\" from which emerge images and motifs such as the mother, the child, the trickster, and the flood among others. History, culture and personal context shape these manifest representations thereby giving them their specific content. These images and motifs are more precisely called \"archetypal images\". However it is common for the term \"archetype\" to be used interchangeably to refer to both \"archetypes-as-such\" and \"archetypal images\".\n\nJung rejected the \"tabula rasa\" theory of human psychological development, believing instead that evolutionary pressures have individual predestinations manifested in archetypes. Jung first used the term \"primordial images\" to refer to what he would later term \"archetypes\". Jung's idea of archetypes was based on Immanuel Kant's categories, Plato's Ideas, and Arthur Schopenhauer's prototypes. For Jung, \"the archetype is the introspectively recognizable form of \"a priori\" psychic orderedness\". \"These images must be thought of as lacking in solid content, hence as unconscious. They only acquire solidity, influence, and eventual consciousness in the encounter with empirical facts.\"\n\nThe archetypes form a dynamic substratum common to all humanity, upon the foundation of which each individual builds his own experience of life, colouring them with his unique culture, personality and life events. Thus, while archetypes themselves may be conceived as a relative few innate nebulous forms, from these may arise innumerable images, symbols and patterns of behavior. While the emerging images and forms are apprehended consciously, the archetypes which inform them are elementary structures which are unconscious and impossible to apprehend.\n\nJung was fond of comparing the form of the archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given \"a priori\". The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.\n\nThe intuition that there was more to the psyche than individual experience possibly began in Jung's childhood. The very first dream he could remember was that of an underground phallic god. Later in life his research on psychotic patients in Burgholzli Hospital and his own self-analysis later supported his early intuition about the existence of universal psychic structures that underlie all human experience and behavior. Jung first referred to these as \"primordial images\" – a term he borrowed from Jacob Burckhardt. Later in 1917 Jung called them \"dominants of the collective unconscious.\"\n\nIt was not until 1919 that he first used the term \"archetypes\" in an essay titled \"Instinct and the Unconscious\". The first element in Greek `arche' signifies 'beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle', but it also signifies 'position of a leader, supreme rule and government' (in other words a kind of 'dominant'): the second element 'type' means 'blow and what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm', ...in the figurative, modern sense, 'pattern underlying form, primordial form'.\n\nIn later years Jung revised and broadened the concept of archetypes even further, conceiving of them as psycho-physical patterns existing in the universe, given specific expression by human consciousness and culture. Jung proposed that the archetype had a dual nature: it exists both in the psyche and in the world at large. He called this non-psychic aspect of the archetype the \"psychoid\" archetype.\n\nJung drew an analogy between the psyche and light on the electromagnetic spectrum. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, which grades into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red end of the spectrum corresponds to the influence of biological instinct, which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet. Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.\n\nThe archetype was not merely a psychic entity, but more fundamentally, a bridge to matter in general. Jung used the term \"unus mundus\" to describe the unitary reality which he believed underlay all manifest phenomena. He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the \"unus mundus\", organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.\n\nIt was this psychoid aspect of the archetype that so impressed Nobel laureate physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Embracing Jung's concept, Pauli believed that the archetype provided a link between physical events and the mind of the scientist who studied them. In doing so he echoed the position adopted by German astronomer Johannes Kepler. Thus the archetypes that ordered our perceptions and ideas are themselves the product of an objective order that transcends both the human mind and the external world.\n\nJung described archetypal events: birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites; archetypal figures: great mother, father, child, devil, god, wise old man, wise old woman, the trickster, the hero; and archetypal motifs: the apocalypse, the deluge, the creation. Although the number of archetypes is limitless, there are a few particularly notable, recurring archetypal images, \"the chief among them being\" (according to Jung) \"the \"shadow\", the \"wise old man\", the \"child\", the \"mother\" ... and her counterpart, the \"maiden\", and lastly the \"anima\" in man and the \"animus\" in woman\". Alternatively he would speak of \"the emergence of certain definite archetypes ... the shadow, the animal, the wise old man, the anima, the animus, the mother, the child\".\n\nThe Self designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole.\n\nThe shadow is a representation of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify.\n\nThe anima archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's sexual expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man's possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The animus archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women.\n\nAny attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.\n\nPopular and new-age uses have often condensed the concept of archetypes into an enumeration of archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess, the wise man and so on. Such enumeration falls short of apprehending the fluid core concept. Strictly speaking, archetypal figures such as the hero, the goddess and the wise man are not archetypes, but archetypal images which have crystallized out of the \"archetypes-as-such\": as Jung put it, \"definite mythological images of motifs ... are nothing more than conscious representations; it would be absurd to assume that such variable representations could be inherited\", as opposed to their deeper, instinctual sources – \"the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images'\".\n\nHowever, the precise relationships between images such as, for example, \"the fish\" and its archetype were not adequately explained by Jung. Here the image of the fish is not strictly speaking an archetype. The \"archetype of the fish\" points to the ubiquitous existence of an innate \"fish archetype\" which gives rise to the fish image. In clarifying the contentious statement that fish archetypes are universal, Anthony Stevens explains that the \"archetype-as-such\" is at once an innate predisposition to form such an image and a preparation to encounter and respond appropriately to the creature \"per se\". This would explain the existence of snake and spider phobias, for example, in people living in urban environments where they have never encountered either creature.\n\nThe confusion about the essential quality of archetypes can partly be attributed to Jung's own evolving ideas about them in his writings and his interchangeable use of the term \"archetype\" and \"primordial image\". Jung was also intent on retaining the raw and vital quality of archetypes as spontaneous outpourings of the unconscious and not to give their specific individual and cultural expressions a dry, rigorous, intellectually formulated meaning.\n\nArchetypes seek actualization within the context of an individual's environment and determine the degree of individuation. Jung also used the terms \"evocation\" and \"constellation\" to explain the process of actualization. Thus for example, the mother archetype is actualized in the mind of the child by the evoking of innate anticipations of the maternal archetype when the child is in the proximity of a maternal figure who corresponds closely enough to its archetypal template. This mother archetype is built into the personal unconscious of the child as a mother \"complex\". Complexes are functional units of the personal unconscious, in the same way that archetypes are units for the collective unconscious.\n\nArchetypes are innate universal pre-conscious psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of the collective unconscious and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.\n\nAs we mature the archetypal plan unfolds through a programmed sequence which Jung called the stages of life. Each stage of life is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.\n\n\"The archetype is a tendency to form such representations of a motif – representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern ... They are indeed an instinctive \"trend\"\". Thus, \"the archetype of initiation is strongly activated to provide a meaningful transition ... with a 'rite of passage' from one stage of life to the next\": such stages may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.\n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss was an advocate of structuralism in anthropology. In his approach to the structure and meaning of myth, Levi-Strauss concluded that present phenomena are transformations of earlier structures or infrastructures: 'the structure of primitive thoughts is present in our minds'.\n\nThe concept of \"social instincts\" proposed by Charles Darwin, the \"faculties\" of Henri Bergson and the isomorphs of gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler are also arguably related to archetypes.\n\nIn his work in psycholinguistics, Noam Chomsky describes an unvarying pattern of language acquisition in children and termed it the language acquisition device. He refers to 'universals' and a distinction is drawn between 'formal' and 'substantive' universals similar to that between archetype as such (structure) and archetypal image.\n\nJean Piaget writes of 'schemata' which are innate and underpin perceptuo-motor activity and the acquisition of knowledge, and are able to draw the perceived environment into their orbit. They resemble archetypes by virtue of their innateness, their activity and their need for environmental correspondence.\n\nIn \"Biological theory and the concept of archetypes\", Michael Fordham considered that innate release mechanisms in animals may be applicable to humans, especially in infancy. The stimuli which produce instinctive behaviour are selected from a wide field by an innate perceptual system and the behaviour is 'released'. Fordham drew a parallel between some of Lorenz's ethological observations on the hierarchical behaviour of wolves and the functioning of archetypes in infancy.\n\nStevens (1982) suggests that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology shows us that each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour is taking place in the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.\n\nStevens suggests that DNA itself can be inspected for the location and transmission of archetypes. As they are co-terminous with natural life they should be expected wherever life is found. He suggests that DNA is the replicable archetype of the species.\n\nStein points out that all the various terms used to delineate the messengers – 'templates, genes, enzymes, hormones, catalysts, pheromones, social hormones' – are concepts similar to archetypes. He mentions archetypal figures which represent messengers such as Hermes, Prometheus or Christ. Continuing to base his arguments on a consideration of biological defence systems he says that it must operate in a whole range of specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must not upset the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.\n\nMelanie Klein: Melanie Klein's idea of unconscious phantasy is closely related to Jung's archetype, as both are composed of image and affect and are \"a priori\" patternings of psyche whose contents are built from experience.\nJacques Lacan: Lacan went beyond the proposition that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary in the same way that archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. If we take the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them. Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.\n\nWilfred Bion: According to Bion, thoughts precede a thinking capacity. Thoughts in a small infant are indistinguishable from sensory data or unorganised emotion. Bion uses the term proto-thoughts for these early phenomena. Because of their connection to sensory data, proto-thoughts are concrete and self-contained (thoughts-in-themselves), not yet capable of symbolic representations or object relations. The thoughts then function as preconceptions – predisposing psychosomatic entities similar to archetypes. Support for this connection comes from the Kleinian analyst Money-Kyrle's observation that Bion's notion of preconceptions is the direct descendant of Plato's Ideas.\n\nSigmund Freud: In the Introductory \"Lectures on Psychoanalysis\" (1916-1917) Freud wrote: \"There can be no doubt that the source [of the fantasies] lie in the instincts; but it still has to be explained why the same fantasies with the same content are created on every occasion. I am prepared with an answer that I know will seem daring to you. I believe that...primal fantasies, and no doubt a few others as well, are a phylogenetic endowment\". His suggestion that primal fantasies are a residue of specific memories of prehistoric experiences have been construed as being aligned with the idea of archetypes. Laplanehe and Pontalis point out that all the so-called primal fantasies relate to the origins and that \"like collective myths they claim to provide a representation of and a 'solution' to whatever constitutes an enigma for the child\".\n\nRobert Langs: More recently, adaptive psychotherapist and psychoanalyst Robert Langs has used archetypal theory as a way of understanding the functioning of what he calls the \"deep unconscious system\". Langs' use of archetypes particularly pertains to issues associated with death anxiety, which Langs takes to be the root of psychic conflict. Like Jung, Langs thinks of archetypes as species-wide, deep unconscious factors.\n\nRossi (1977) suggests that the function and characteristic between left and right cerebral hemispheres may enable us to locate the archetypes in the right cerebral hemisphere. He cites research indicating that left hemispherical functioning is primarily verbal and associational, and that of the right primarily visuospatial and apperceptive. Thus the left hemisphere is equipped as a critical, analytical, information processor while the right hemisphere operates in a 'gestalt' mode. This means that the right hemisphere is better at getting a picture of a whole from a fragment, is better at working with confused material, is more irrational than the left, and more closely connected to bodily processes. Once expressed in the form of words, concepts and language of the ego's left hemispheric realm, however, they become only representations that 'take their colour' from the individual consciousness. Inner figures such as shadow, anima and animus would be archetypal processes having source in the right hemisphere.\n\nHenry (1977) alluded to Maclean's model of the tripartite brain suggesting that the reptilian brain is an older part of the brain and may contain not only drives but archetypal structures as well. The suggestion is that there was a time when emotional behaviour and cognition were less developed and the older brain predominated. There is an obvious parallel with Jung's idea of the archetypes 'crystallising out' over time.\n\nArchetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as the trickster or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden with meaning when employed in a particular work.\n\nArchetypal psychology was developed by James Hillman in the second half of the 20th century. Hillman trained at the Jung Institute and was its Director after graduation. Archetypal psychology is in the Jungian tradition and most directly related to analytical psychology and psychodynamic theory, yet departs radically. Archetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the ego and focuses on the psyche, or soul, itself and the \"archai\", the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, \"the fundamental fantasies that animate all life\". Archetypal psychology is a polytheistic psychology, in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and myths, gods, goddesses, demigods, mortals and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. The ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies.\n\nThe main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is Jung's analytical psychology. It is strongly influenced by Classical Greek, Renaissance, and Romantic ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers, alchemists, and psychologists include: Nietzsche, Henry Corbin, Keats, Shelley, Petrarch, and Paracelsus. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the psyche – the soul.\nMany archetypes have been used in treatment of psychological illnesses. Jung's first research was done with schizophrenics. A current example is teaching young men or boys archetypes through using picture books to help with the development. In addition nurses treat patients through the use of archetypes. Archetype therapy offers a wide range of uses if applied correctly, and it is still being expanded in Jungian schools today. With the list of archetypes being endless the healing possibilities are vast.\n\nArchetypal pedagogy was developed by Clifford Mayes. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. More recently the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), based on Jung's theories of both archetypes and personality types, has been used for pedagogical applications (not unlike the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator).\n\nArchetypes abound in contemporary films and literature as they have in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of the collective unconscious that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.\n\nA contemporary definition is given by O'Brien (2017) as follows: \"Archetypes are universal organizing themes or patterns that appear regardless of space, time, or person. Appearing in all existential realms and at all levels of systematic recursion, they are organized as themes in the unus mundus, which Jung (1970 Vol. 14. Mysterium coniunctionis. (1970), p. 505) described as “the potential world outside of time,” and are detectable through synchronicities\".\n\nContemporary cinema is a rich source of archetypal images, most commonly evidenced for instance in the hero archetype: the one who saves the day and is young and naive, like Luke Skywalker in \"Star Wars\", or older and cynical, like Rick Blaine in \"Casablanca\". The mentor archetype is a common character in all types of films. They can appear and disappear as needed, usually helping the hero in the beginning, and then letting them do the hard part on their own. The mentor helps train, prepare, encourage and guide the hero. They are obvious in some films: Mr. Miyagi in \"The Karate Kid\", Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Jiminy Cricket in \"Pinocchio\", Obi-Wan, and later Yoda in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy.\n\nThe Shadow, one's darker side, often associated with the villain of numerous films and books, but can be internal as in \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". The shapeshifter is the person who misleads the hero or who changes frequently and can be depicted quite literally e.g. The T-1000 robot in \"Terminator II\". The Trickster creates disruptions of the status quo, maybe childlike and help us see the absurdity in situations, provide comic relief; e.g. Yoda in \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Bugs Bunny and Brer Rabbit. The Child often innocent; could be someone childlike who needs protecting but may be imbued with special powers (e.g. E.T.). The Bad Father – often seen as a dictator type, or evil and cruel (e.g. Darth Vader in \"Star Wars\"). The Bad Mother (e.g. \"Mommie Dearest\"), along with evil stepmothers and wicked witches. The Bad Child; e.g., \"The Bad Seed\", \"The Omen\".\n\nJungian archetypes are heavily integrated into the personalities of the characters in the \"Persona\" series of games. In \"Persona 3\" and \"Persona 4\", the characters with whom you form relationships, (in the game called \"Social Links\") which are each based on a particular archetype. They are formally differentiated by different tarot arcana, however the primary basis of the game's characterization originates from archetypes.\n\nIn marketing, an archetype is a genre to a brand, based upon symbolism. The idea behind using brand archetypes in marketing is to anchor the brand against an icon already embedded within the conscience and subconscious of humanity. In the minds of both the brand owner and the public, aligning with a brand archetype makes the brand easier to identify. Twelve archetypes have been proposed for use with branding: Sage, Innocent, Explorer, Ruler, Creator, Caregiver, Magician, Hero, Outlaw, Lover, Jester, and Regular Guy/Girl.\n\nJung's staunchest critics have accused him of either mystical or metaphysical essentialism. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been observed by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific in a way that may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains of knowledge that seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.\n\nFeminist critiques have focused on aspects of archetypal theory that are seen as being reductionistic and providing a stereotyped view of femininity and masculinity.\n\nAnother criticism of archetypes is that seeing myths as universals tends to abstract them from the history of their actual creation, and their cultural context. Some modern critics state that archetypes reduce cultural expressions to generic decontextualized concepts, stripped bare of their unique cultural context, reducing a complex reality into something \"simple and easy to grasp\". Other critics respond that archetypes do nothing more than to solidify the cultural prejudices of the myths interpreter – namely modern Westerners. Modern scholarship with its emphasis on power and politics have seen archetypes as a colonial device to level the specifics of individual cultures and their stories in the service of grand abstraction.\n\nOthers have accused him of a romanticised and prejudicial promotion of 'primitivism' through the medium of archetypal theory. Archetypal theory has been posited as being scientifically unfalsifiable and even questioned as to being a suitable domain of psychological and scientific enquiry. Jung mentions the demarcation between experimental and descriptive psychological study, seeing archetypal psychology as rooted by necessity in the latter camp, grounded as it was (to a degree) in clinical case-work.\n\nBecause Jung's viewpoint was essentially subjectivist, he displayed a somewhat Neo-Kantian perspective of a skepticism for knowing things in themselves and a preference of inner experience over empirical data. This skepticism opened Jung up to the charge of countering materialism with another kind of reductionism, one that reduces everything to subjective psychological explanation and wooly quasi-mystical assertions.\n\nPost-Jungian criticism seeks to contextualise, expand and modify Jung's original discourse on archetypes. Michael Fordham is critical of tendencies to relate imagery produced by patients to historical parallels only, e.g. from alchemy, mythology or folklore. A patient who produces archetypal material with striking alchemical parallels runs the risk of becoming more divorced than before from his setting in contemporary life.\n\n\n"}

Robots of this degree of complexity do not yet exist, but they have been widely anticipated in science fiction, films and are a topic of active research and development in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe best known set of laws are those written by Isaac Asimov in the 1940s, or based upon them, but other sets of laws have been proposed by researchers in the decades since then.\n\nThe best known set of laws are Isaac Asimov's \"Three Laws of Robotics\". These were introduced in his 1942 short story \"Runaround\", although they were foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. The Three Laws are:\n\n\nNear the end of his book \"Foundation and Earth\", a zeroth law was introduced:\n\nAdaptations and extensions exist based upon this framework. As of 2011 they remain a \"fictional device\".\n\nIn 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of Great Britain jointly published a set of five ethical \"principles for designers, builders and users of robots\" in the real world, along with seven \"high-level messages\" intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop:\n\n\nThe messages intended to be conveyed were:\nThe EPSRC principles are broadly recognised as a useful starting point. In 2016 Tony Prescott organised workshop to revise these principles, e.g. to differentiate ethical from legal principles.\n\nAnother comprehensive terminological codification for the legal assessment of the technological developments in the robotics industry has already begun mainly in Asian countries. This progress represents a contemporary reinterpretation of the law (and ethics) in the field of robotics, an interpretation that assumes a rethinking of traditional legal constellations. These include primarily legal liability issues in civil and criminal law.\n\nIn June 2016, Satya Nadella, a CEO of Microsoft Corporation at the time, had an interview with the \"Slate\" magazine and roughly sketched five rules for artificial intelligences to be observed by their designers:\n\nMark W. Tilden is a robotics physicist who was a pioneer in developing simple robotics. His three guiding principles/rules for robots are:\n\n\nWhat is notable in these three rules is that these are basically rules for \"wild\" life, so in essence what Tilden stated is that what he wanted was \"proctoring a silicon species into sentience, but with full control over the specs. Not plant. Not animal. Something else.\"\n\n"}

The audio-files are normally in MP3 format and spliced with audio-editing software online. The new, edited song is called mashup. The expression mashup culture is also strongly connected to mashup in music. Even though it is originally not a political community, the producer of mash-up music are related to the issue of copyright. Mashup Culture is even regarded as \"a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts\".\n\nThe history of mashup culture in general can be dated back to the beginnings of dada and conceptual art. Artists such as Marcel Duchamp were the first to introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in collages, to the world of higher art. These artists believed that even though certain artifacts were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context. However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music. From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet. With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music. Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before. Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom when it came to the accessibility of audio files lead to the development of a new form of cult around the transformation of musical pieces. This \"reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet\" was turning into more than just a fashion just as \"the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a \"raison d’eˆtre\" for a culture based on audio data’’ states Alistair Riddell in 2001. During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term \"mashup\" but under the name of \"creative bootleg\" or \"bastard pop\". Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as Hip Hop before, it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such. Especially peer-to-peer sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.\n\nMashup culture is motivated by a number of different factors.\n\nMashup culture is sometimes regarded as a cultural movement against common, existing music that is published by the music industry. In 2002, a \"Newsweek\" article described the mashup of songs as a strategy of Londoner DJs to transform music they considered bad into something they could appreciate and were willing to listen to. Even though mashup culture has its origin in online communities, it entered a more art-related realm. It is art used as a statement against the content music industry provides.\n\nIt can even be considered as a political statement against copyright laws and restrictions imposed by the government as well. \"Reframing of the original narrative\" is regarded as a way to create a new and unique product which leads to a \"fresh perspective\" of the original.\nMurray states \"there’s the question of the kind of Internet we want moving forward – one increasingly controlled by corporate gatekeepers who get to sanction what creative expression looks like, or one in which the freedom of this expression is valued above share price\". Copyright issues have always been limiting the possibilities of mashup culture. Those implications by law have led to the problem of online piracy. Mashups are often created with illegally acquired content. This closeness to illegality has become part of this culture. \"In some cases, the illegality of piracy contributes to the appeal of unauthorized copies online\" states Shiga in her article Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture. Even though copyright laws were intentionally supposed to stop illegal downloads, they contributed to the appeal of mashup and to the culture existing around it.\n\nAnother important aspect of the success of mashup culture nowadays lies in the do-it-yourself or DIY trend. Consumers are turning into producers as well, especially due to the simplification of online tools that help creating personalized content.\n\nPaul D. Miller, also known as DJ Spooky, published a book about how mashup culture transforms our society. In \"Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture\", he investigates \"the nature of that transformation\" stating that \"rapid advances in technology [that] have transformed art and communication\". He describes sampling as an essential part of our society. The book was published by the MIT Press and highly recognized by scholars such as Lawrence Lessig.\n\n"}

It is assumed that the input stimuli of the drivers are restricted to their own velocity formula_2, the net distance (bumper-to-bumper distance) formula_4 to the leading vehicle formula_5 (where formula_6 denotes the vehicle length), and the velocity formula_7 of the leading vehicle. The equation of motion of each vehicle is characterized by an acceleration function that depends on those input stimuli:\n\nIn general, the driving behavior of a single driver-vehicle unit formula_9 might not merely depend on the immediate leader formula_5 but on the formula_11 vehicles in front. The equation of motion in this more generalized form reads:\n\n\nCellular automaton (CA) models use integer variables to describe the dynamical properties of the system. The road is divided into sections of a certain length formula_13 and the time is discretized to steps of formula_14. Each road section can either be occupied by a vehicle or empty and the dynamics are given by update rules of the form:\n\n(the simulation time formula_17 is measured in units of formula_14 and the vehicle positions formula_1 in units of formula_13).\n\nThe time scale is typically given by the reaction time of a human driver, formula_21. With formula_14 fixed, the length of the road sections determines the granularity of the model. At a complete standstill, the average road length occupied by one vehicle is approximately 7.5 meters. Setting formula_13 to this value leads to a model where one vehicle always occupies exactly one section of the road and a velocity of 5 corresponds to formula_24, which is then set to be the maximum velocity a driver wants to drive at. However, in such a model, the smallest possible acceleration would be formula_25 which is unrealistic. Therefore, many modern CA models use a finer spatial discretization, for example formula_26, leading to a smallest possible acceleration of formula_27.\n\nAlthough cellular automaton models lack the accuracy of the time-continuous car-following models, they still have the ability to reproduce a wide range of traffic phenomena. Due to the simplicity of the models, they are numerically very efficient and can be used to simulate large road networks in realtime or even faster.\n\n\n"}

It has strongly affected American and British culture, concerning private issues such as the family unit and sexuality, as well as issues that carry over into the public square, such as the temperance movement.\n\nIn tracing the origins of moralism, sociologist Malcolm Waters writes that \"Moralism emerged from a clash between the unrestrained character of frontier expansionism, a middle-class, Protestant emphasis on respectability cultivated in small-town America and an egalitarian and anti-intellectual evangelism among splinter Protestant groups.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the issues of abolition and temperance formed the \"twin pillars\" of moralism, becoming popular through Christian Churches in the United States, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Moralism as promoted by some Christian denominations, such as the Quakers, manifested in wide support for abolitionism and industrial unionism. \n\nThe rise of postmillennialism in the 19th century \"encouraged a general culture of Protestant moralism and pushed it toward a series of social reform movements, from antislavery and abolitionism (freedom for the slaves now), to protests against Indian Removal, to antiwar and peace efforts, to women's rights, to temperance work before and after the Civil War.\" As such, the campaign for women's suffrage, evidenced by the ethos of organisations such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), was highly driven by the moralism of that era.\n\nIn the latter part of 20th century, as well as the 21st century, moralists in the United States turned their attention to championing the pro-life movement. Moralists have also focused their efforts in maintaining blue laws, such as those that discourage Sunday shopping, in accordance with first-day Sabbatarian beliefs that resonate with the sensibilities of labourers and trade unions.\n\n"}

Due to its focus on the letter of the rules over the spirit of the rules, it is often seen as unsporting, un-fun, or unsociable. This behaviour is most often found in games with a wide range of game features, lengthy campaigns or prize tournaments such as massively multiplayer or collectible games. Those wishing to discuss the behavior without pejorative connotation may use the neutral term optimization.\n\nPowergaming in roleplaying games can take several forms. One form is the deliberate creation of optimal player characters (PCs), with the aim of maximising the power the player wields in the game world. This is known as min-maxing, due to the practice of maximising desirable or \"powerful\" traits while minimising underpowered or unuseful traits. Such characters often draw criticism for not fitting the theme and tone of the game world or for being difficult to challenge. Another form of powergaming involves a focus on acquiring power during game progression, often by acquiring powerful equipment or unusual abilities. This lends itself to gameplay which is materialistic (and often, in the context of the game world, arguably amoral) and can frustrate other players who are looking to interact with the game world, score points, and not merely acquire game resources. Another term for a powergamer is a munchkin, who may be differentiated from normal powergamers to describe players who seek to acquire power and loot at the expense their teammates.\n\nIn online text-based role-playing games that emphasize collaborative role-play over acquiring levels or skills, a player can be described as a powergamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own prerogative. They may also be a player who tries to force others to participate in unwanted role-playing. For instance, a player who unilaterally describes his character as doing something with (or to) another character that would usually require the other to play along — such as having a fight or a sexual encounter — is considered to be powergaming. In such games, in which a sense of community and rapport between players is seen as crucial and conducive to the game's overall well-being, powergaming is generally regarded as extremely offensive behaviour if it is not stated in the rules as being a bannable offense. It is often seen as synonymous with twinking or \"godmoding\".\n\nIn video games, powergamers enjoy being at the bleeding edge of progression of their selected game, taking part in every activity that yields the fastest progression, and bypassing the \"lesser\" activities or any other secondary job/trait/skill. This is a wide generalization however. A gamer that likes to maximise all aspects of the game and do so in an expedient manner is also classified as a powergamer, often seeing more of the world than the \"average\" player would.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2083759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083759", "title": "Reservation price", "text": "Reservation price\n\nReservation (or reserve) price is a limit on the price of a good or a service. On the demand side, it is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay; on the supply side, it is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a good or service. Reservation prices are commonly used in auctions, but the concept is extended beyond.\n\nIn microeconomics, consumers set their reservation price as the highest price that they are willing to pay for goods or a service, while seller set the smallest price at which they would sell. Similarly, in finance, the reservation price—also called the indifference price—is the value at which an investor would be willing to buy (or sell) a financial security given his or her particular utility function.\n\nReservation prices are commonly used in auctions, where the seller may or may not make it known what the lowest acceptable price is. Buyers—especially if by proxy—may have their own reservation price at which they are unwilling to further bid. This can be seen as the \"walk away\" point for either party, in negotiation where the reservation price is the point beyond which a negotiator is ready to walk away from a negotiated agreement. A seller may produce a reservation demand, which is a schedule of reservation prices at which a seller would be willing to sell different quantities of a particular good.\n\nReservation prices vary for the buyers and sellers according to their disposable income, their desire for—or to sell—the good, and knowledge of information about substitute goods. A reservation price can be used to help calculate the consumer surplus or the producer surplus with reference to the equilibrium price.\n\nIn the basic model of optimal auction design developed by Roger Myerson (1981), the optimal reservation price (i.e., the smallest admissible bid) is independent of the number of bidders. Myerson assumes that the bidders have private independent values (i.e., each bidder’s valuation of the object to be auctioned off is a realization of a random variable observed only by the bidder, and the random variables are stochastically independent). For example, if every bidder’s valuation is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,100], then the optimal reservation price is 50. According to traditional economic theory, the optimal reservation price results from balancing two opposing effects. First, a higher reservation price is desirable for the seller since it deters bidders from falsely claiming that they have only a small valuation. Second, a higher reservation price is undesirable for the seller since it deters bidders with truly small valuations from participating in the auction. According to behavioral economic theory, a reservation price may also have additional effects. In particular, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have argued that a reservation price can serve as a reference point when bidders have preferences as studied in prospect theory. \n\n\n"}

He was an active researcher in animal learning in the Skinnerian tradition. He was one of the founders of the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior.\n\nRichard Herrnstein was born on 20 May 1930, in New York City, to a family of Jewish Hungarian immigrants; the son of Flora Irene (née Friedman) and Rezso Herrnstein, a housepainter. He was educated at the High School of Music & Art and the City College of New York, receiving a B.A. from the latter in 1952. In 1955, Herrnstein obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard University, with a thesis titled \"Behavioral Consequences of the Removal of a Discriminative Stimulus Associated with Variable-Interval Reinforcement\".\n\nIn 1977, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nHis major research finding as an experimental psychologist is the matching law, the tendency of animals to allocate their choices in direct proportion to the rewards they provide. To illustrate the phenomenon, if there are two sources of reward, one of which is twice as rich as the other, Herrnstein found that animals often chose at twice the frequency the alternative that was seemingly twice as valuable. That is known as matching, both in quantitative analysis of behavior and mathematical psychology. He also developed melioration theory with William Vaughan, Jr.\n\nHe was the Edgar Pierce Professor of psychology at Harvard University and worked with Skinner in the Harvard pigeon lab, where he did research on choice behavior and behavioral economics. In 1965, and with Edwin Boring, Herrnstein wrote \"A Source Book in the History of Psychology\".\n\nHerrnstein's research focused first on natural concepts and human intelligence in the 1970s, and peaked in prolificacy with the publication of his and Charles Murray's controversial best-selling book, \"The Bell Curve\". Herrnstein died of cancer shortly before the book was released.\n\nFive levels of classification capacities: discrimination, rote, open-ended categorization, concepts, and abstract relations (Herrnstein, 1990).\n\nPerhaps his most notable accomplishment was the formulation of the matching law: choices are distributed according to rates of reinforcement for making the choices. An instance for two choices can be stated mathematically as\n\nwhere \"R\" and \"R\" are rates of response for two alternative responses, and \"r\" and \"r\" are rates of reinforcement for the same two responses. Behavior conforming to this law is matching, and explanations of matching and of departures from matching are a large and important part of the literature on behavioral choice.\n\nHerrnstein married his first wife, Barbara Brodo, on 28 May 1951. The couple had a daughter together, Julia, before their divorce in February 1961. Through his second marriage to Susan Chalk Gouinlock, on 11 November 1961, he fathered two sons named Max and James.\n\n"}
{"id": "234938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234938", "title": "Rolfing", "text": "Rolfing\n\nRolfing () is a form of alternative medicine originally developed by Ida Rolf (1896–1979) as Structural Integration. It is typically delivered as a series of ten hands-on physical manipulation sessions sometimes called \"the recipe\". It is based on Rolf's ideas about how the human body's \"energy field\" can benefit when aligned with the Earth's gravitational field. Practitioners combine superficial and deep manual therapy with movement prompts. The process is sometimes painful.\n\nThe principles of Rolfing contradict established medical knowledge, and there is no good evidence Rolfing is effective for the treatment of any health condition. It is recognized as a pseudoscience and has been characterized as quackery. It is not known whether Rolfing is safe or cost-effective.\n\nIda Rolf described the body as organized around an axis perpendicular to the earth, parallel to the pull of gravity, and she believed the function of the body was optimal when it was organized in that way. She saw the body as continually in a struggle with gravity; in her view, gravity tends to shorten fascia, leading to disorder of the body's arrangement around its axis and creating imbalance, inefficiency in movement, and pain. Rolfers aim to lengthen the fascia in order to restore the body's arrangement around its axis and facilitate improved movement. Rolf also discussed this in terms of \"energy\" and said:\n\nRolfers make a life study of relating bodies and their fields to the earth and its gravity field, and we so organize the body [so] that the gravity field can reinforce the body's energy field. This is our primary concept.\n\nOn its website as of August 2016, the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration described Rolfing as \"a form of bodywork that reorganizes the connective tissues, called fascia, that permeate the entire body.\"\n\nThe manipulation is sometimes referred to as a type of bodywork, or as a type of massage. Some osteopaths were influenced by Rolf, and some of her students became teachers of massage, including one of the founders of myofascial release.\n\nRolf claimed to have found an association between emotions and the soft tissue, writing \"although rolfing is not primarily a psychotherapeutic approach to the problems of humans\", it does constitute an \"approach to the personality through the myofascial collagen components of the physical body\". She claimed Rolfing could balance the mental and emotional aspects of subjects, and that \"the amazing psychological changes that appeared in Rolfed individuals were completely unexpected\". Rolfers suggest their manipulations can cause the release of painful repressed memories. Rolfers also hold that by manipulating the body they can bring about changes in personality so, for example, teaching somebody to walk with confidence will make them a more confident person. The connection between physical structure and psychology has not been proven by scientific studies.\n\nRolfers posit that they manipulate the body's fascial layers. Rolfing also uses a combination of active and passive movement retraining.\n\nRolfing is typically performed in a progression of 10 sessions, sometimes called \"the recipe\". The first three sessions of the protocol focus on superficial tissues, the next four focus on deeper tissues and specifically the pelvis, and the final sessions address the whole body.\n\nA session typically lasts between 60 and 90 minutes. The recipient wears undergarments. Positions for the work include lying on a table, sitting, and standing.\n\nRolfing treatments are sometimes painful. For adults, there may be moments of intense sensation during a treatment or soreness afterward. However, the technique can be done gently enough for children and the elderly. Rolf believed fascia tightens as a protective mechanism, and therefore thought an aggressive approach could be counter-productive.\n\nIn 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published a review of 17 alternative therapies including Rolfing which concluded no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Accordingly In 2017 the Australian government named Rolfing as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\".\n\nThe American Cancer Society says the deep soft tissue manipulations such as those used in Rolfing are a concern if practiced on people with cancer near tumor sites. \n\nProponents of Rolfing claim it can be used to alleviate pain. However Rolfing's focus on appropriate \"alignment\" of structures of the body does not reflect modern science about pain.\n\nIn 2010 \"The New York Times\" reported that Rolfing was enjoying a \"resurgence\" following an endorsement from Mehmet Oz on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". \n\nBecause of its dependence on vitalistic concepts and its unevidenced propositions about the connection between physical manipulation and psychology, Rolfing is classified as a pseudoscience. Medical historian Barbara Clow writes that, in common with many other types of alternative medicine, Rolfing takes a view of illness and of therapy which conflicts with mainstream medicine. Psychologist and attorney Christopher Barden has numbered Rolfing among \"dangerous and controversial\" methods that pose a risk to the public. Biologist Dan Agin has identified Rolfing as a popular kind of \"quack medicine\" in the \"raucous bazaar\" of the United States's alternative medicine scene, Health journalist Rose Shapiro lists Rolfing among the many popular \"quack treatments\" that rally today under the banner of integrative medicine, and skeptic Robert Todd Carroll has said the vague health claims made by Rolfers are characteristic of those made by \"quacks\".\n\nIda Rolf began working on clients in New York City in the 1940s with the premise that the human structure could be organized \"in relation to gravity\". She developed structural integration with one of her sons and by the 1950s she was teaching her work across the United States. In the mid-1960s she began teaching at Esalen Institute, where she gathered a loyal following of students and practitioners. Esalen was the epicenter of the Human Potential Movement, allowing Rolf to exchange ideas with many of their leaders, including Fritz Perls. Rolf incorporated a number of ideas from other areas including osteopathic manipulation, cranial osteopathy, hatha yoga, and the general semantics of Alfred Korzybski. In 1971 she founded the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration. The school has been based in Boulder, Colorado since 1972, and as of 2010 included five institutes worldwide.\n\nSince Rolf's death, the field of Structural Integration has fragmented into various schools as a result of legal disputes among her followers. Of these schools, the Rolf Institute is the only one with the use of the trademarked terms \"Rolfing\" and \"Certified Rolfer\". Other schools of Structural Integration certify \"Practitioners of the Rolf Method of Structural Integration\" including the Guild for Structural Integration, Hellerwork Structural Integration, Aston Patterning, SOMA, KMI, and a dozen other Structural Integration schools. A professional membership organization exists called the International Association of Structural Integration, which has certified practitioners by exam since 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

Fifty-four indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of well-being, and opportunity to progress show the relative performance of nations. The index is published by the nonprofit Social Progress Imperative, and is based on the writings of Amartya Sen, Douglass North, and Joseph Stiglitz. The SPI measures the well-being of a society by observing social and environmental outcomes directly rather than the economic factors. The social and environmental factors include wellness (including health, shelter and sanitation), equality, inclusion, sustainability and personal freedom and safety.\n\nThe index combines three dimensions\n\nEach dimension includes four components, which are each composed of between three and five specific outcome indicators. The included indicators are selected because they are measured appropriately, with a consistent methodology, by the same organization across all (or essentially all) of the countries in the sample. Together, this framework aims to capture a broad range of interrelated factors revealed by the scholarly literature and practitioner experience as underpinning social progress. \n\nTwo key features of the \"Social Progress Index\" are:\n\nSocial Progress Imperative evaluated hundreds of possible indicators while developing the \"Social Progress Index\", including engaging researchers at MIT to determine what indicators best differentiated the performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there are sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.\n\nIn 2010, a group of global leaders from the social sector sought to develop a better measure of a country's level of development and, by extension, better understand its development priorities. Funded by private foundations and under the technical guidance of Professors Michael Porter from Harvard Business School and Scott Stern from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the group formed Social Progress Imperative and launched a beta version of the \"Social Progress Index\" for 50 countries in 2013 to measure a comprehensive array of components of social and environmental performance and aggregate them into an overall framework.\n\nThis work was influenced by the contributions of Amartya Sen on social development, as well as by the recent call for action in the report \"Mismeasuring Our Lives\" by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. The \"Social Progress Index\" was released in 2014 for 133 countries with a second version in 2015.\n\nOn 11 July 2013, Social Progress Imperative's chairman and professor at Harvard Business School, Michael Porter, addressed the United Nations 6th Ministerial Forum for Development and discussed the Social Progress Index.\n\nIn addition to the global \"Social Progress Index\", the methodology used to create it has been adapted to measure social and environmental performance in smaller areas, such as the Amazon region of Brazil. Other projects include a \"Social Progress Index\" for the Municipality of Guatemala City. Fundacion Paraguaya has integrated elements of the \"Social Progress Index\" into its Poverty Stoplight tool. The national government of Paraguay is setting a target for \"Social Progress Index\" performance alongside GDP targets.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that the European Commission had agreed to partner with Social Progress Imperative to create a social progress index for the European Union.The EU Social Progress Index was published in October, 2016.\n\nA similar index, although with some differences compared to the nation list (and therefore not directly comparable), has been published for the individual U.S. states.\n\nColor key:\n\nColor key:\n\nFrom an econometric stand point, the Index appears to be similar to other efforts aimed at overcoming the limitation of traditional economic measure such as the gross domestic product (GDP). One major criticism is that although the Social Progress Index can be seen as a superset of indicators used by earlier econometric models such as Gross National Well-being Index 2005, Bhutan Gross National Happiness Index of 2012, and World Happiness Report of 2012, Yet, unlike them, it ignores measures of subjective life satisfaction and psychological well-being. Other critics point out that \"there remain certain dimensions that are currently not included in the SPI. These are the concentration of wealth in the top 1 percent of the population, efficiency of the judicial system, and quality of the transportation infrastructure.\"\n\nSome critics argue that \"we must be wary. Though words such as “inclusive capitalism” are bandied around increasingly these days to signal a new age, free from ideological battlegrounds between public and private, much of what the organization’s founders say about it confirms that the index is more about being “business inclusive” than “inclusive capitalism.”\n\n"}
{"id": "203510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203510", "title": "Social constructionism", "text": "Social constructionism\n\nSocial constructionism is a theory of knowledge in sociology and communication theory that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality. The theory centers on the notion that meanings are developed in coordination with others rather than separately within each individual.\n\nSocial constructionism questions what is defined by humans and society to be reality. Therefore, social constructs can be different based on the society and the events surrounding the time period in which they exist. An example of a social construct is money or the concept of currency, as people in society have agreed to give it importance/ value. Another example of a social construction is the concept of self/ self-identity. Charles Cooley stated based on his Looking-Glass-Self theory: \"I am not who you think I am; I am not who I think I am; I am who I think you think I am.\" This demonstrates how people in society construct ideas or concepts that may not exist without the existence of people or language to validate those concepts.\n\nThere are weak and strong social constructs. Weak social constructs rely on brute facts (which are fundamental facts that are difficult to explain or understand, such as quarks) or institutional facts (which are formed from social conventions). Strong social constructs rely on the human perspective and knowledge that doesn't just exist, but is rather constructed by society.\n\nA social construct or construction concerns the meaning, notion, or connotation placed on an object or event by a society, and adopted by the inhabitants of that society with respect to how they view or deal with the object or event. In that respect, a social construct as an idea would be widely accepted as natural by the society.\n\nA major focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the construction of their perceived social reality. It involves looking at the ways social phenomena are developed, institutionalized, known, and made into tradition by humans.\n\nIn terms of background, social constructionism is rooted in \"symbolic interactionism\" and \"phenomenology.\" With Berger and Luckmann's \"The Social Construction of Reality\" published in 1966, this concept found its hold. More than four decades later, a sizable number of theory and research pledged to the basic tenet that people \"make their social and cultural worlds at the same time these worlds make them.\" It is a viewpoint that uproots social processes \"simultaneously playful and serious, by which reality is both revealed and concealed, created and destroyed by our activities.\" It provides a substitute to the \"Western intellectual tradition\" where the researcher \"earnestly seeks certainty in a representation of reality by means of propositions.\"\n\nIn social constructionist terms, \"taken-for-granted realities\" are cultivated from \"interactions between and among social agents;\" furthermore, reality is not some objective truth \"waiting to be uncovered through positivist scientific inquiry.\" Rather, there can be \"multiple realities that compete for truth and legitimacy.\" Social constructionism understands the \"fundamental role of language and communication\" and this understanding has \"contributed to the linguistic turn\" and more recently the \"turn to discourse theory.\" The majority of social constructionists abide by the belief that \"language does not mirror reality; rather, it constitutes [creates] it.\"\n\nA broad definition of social constructionism has its supporters and critics in the organizational sciences. A constructionist approach to various organizational and managerial phenomena appear to be more commonplace and on the rise.\n\nAndy Lock and Tomj Strong trace some of the fundamental tenets of social constructionism back to the work of the 18th century Italian political philosopher, rhetorician, historian, and jurist Giambattista Vico.\n\nBerger and Luckmann give credit to Max Scheler as a large influence as he created the idea of Sociology of knowledge which influenced social construction theory.\n\nAccording to Lock and Strong, other influential thinkers whose work has affected the development of social constructionism are: Edmund Husserl, Alfred Schutz, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, Jürgen Habermas, Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, Valentin Volosinov, Lev Vygotsky, George Herbert Mead, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Gregory Bateson, Harold Garfinkel, Erving Goffman, Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, Ken Gergen, Mary Gergen, Rom Harre, and John Shotter.\n\nSince its appearance in the 1950s, personal construct psychology (PCP) has mainly developed as a constructivist theory of personality and a system of transforming individual meaning-making processes, largely in therapeutic contexts. It was based around the notion of persons as scientists who form and test theories about their worlds. Therefore, it represented one of the first attempts to appreciate the constructive nature of experience and the meaning persons give to their experience. Social constructionism (SC), on the other hand, mainly developed as a form of a critique, aimed to transform the oppressing effects of the social meaning-making processes. Over the years, it has grown into a cluster of different approaches, with no single SC position. However, different approaches under the generic term of SC are loosely linked by some shared assumptions about language, knowledge, and reality.\n\nA usual way of thinking about the relationship between PCP and SC is treating them as two separate entities that are similar in some aspects, but also very different in others. This way of conceptualizing this relationship is a logical result of the circumstantial differences of their emergence. In subsequent analyses these differences between PCP and SC were framed around several points of tension, formulated as binary oppositions: personal/social; individualist/relational; agency/structure; constructivist/constructionist. Although some of the most important issues in contemporary psychology are elaborated in these contributions, the polarized positioning also sustained the idea of a separation between PCP and SC, paving the way for only limited opportunities for dialogue between them.\n\nReframing the relationship between PCP and SC may be of use in both the PCP and the SC communities. On one hand, it extends and enriches SC theory and points to benefits of applying the PCP “toolkit” in constructionist therapy and research. On the other hand, the reframing contributes to PCP theory and points to new ways of addressing social construction in therapeutic conversations.\n\nLike social constructionism, social constructivism states that people work together to construct artifacts. While social constructionism focuses on the artifacts that are created through the social interactions of a group, social constructivism focuses on an individual's learning that takes place because of his or her interactions in a group.\n\nSocial constructivism has been studied by many educational psychologists, who are concerned with its implications for teaching and learning. For more on the psychological dimensions of social constructivism, see the work of Ernst von Glasersfeld and A. Sullivan Palincsar.\n\nSystemic therapy is a form of psychotherapy which seeks to address people as people in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups and their interactional patterns and dynamics.\n\nA bibliographic review of social constructionism as used within communication studies was published in 2016. It features a good overview of resources from that disciplinary perspective.\n\nThe concepts of \"weak\" and strong as applied to opposing philosophical positions, \"isms\", inform a teleologythe goal-oriented, meaningful or \"final end\" of an interpretation of reality. \"Isms\" are not personal opinions, but the extreme, modal, formulations that actual persons, individuals, can then consider, and take a position between. There are opposing philosophical positions concerning the feasibility of co-creating a common, shared, social reality, called \"weak\" and strong.\n\nJohn R. Searle does not elucidate the terms strong and \"weak\" in his book \"The Construction of Social Reality\", but he clearly uses them in his Chinese room argument, where he debates the feasibility of creating a computing machine with a sharable understanding of reality, and he adds \"We are precisely such machines.\" Strong artificial intelligence (Strong AI) is the bet that computer programmers will somehow eventually achieve a computing machine with a mind of its own, and that it will eventually be more powerful than a human mind. Weak AI bets they won't.\n\nDavid Deutsch in his book \"The Fabric of Reality\" uses a form of strong Turing principle to share Frank Tipler's view of the final state of the universe as an omnipotent (but not omniscient), Omega point, computer. \"But this computer is a society of creative thinkers, or people\" (albeit posthuman transhuman persons), having debates in order to generate information, in the never-ending attempt to attain omniscience of this physicsits evolutionary forms, its computational abilities, and the methods of its epistemologyhaving an eternity to do so. (p. 356)\n\nBecause both the Chinese room argument and the construction of social reality deal with Searle and his debates, and because they both use \"weak\" and strong to denote a philosophical position, and because both debate the programmability of \"the other\", it is worth noting the correspondence that \"strong AI\" is strong social constructionism, and \"weak AI\" is weak social constructivism.\n\nStrong social constructiv\"ism\" says \"none are able to \"communicate\" either a full reality or an accurate ontology, therefore my position must impose, by a sort of divine right, my observer-relative epistemology\", whereas weak social constructiv\"ism\" says \"none are able to \"know\" a full reality, therefore \"we must\" cooperate, informing and conveying an objective ontology as best we can.\"\n\n\"Weak social constructionism\" sees the underlying, objective, \"brute fact\" elements of the class of languages and functional assignments of human, metaphysical, reality. Brute facts are all facts that are not institutional facts (e.g., metaphysical, social agreement). The skeptic portrays the \"weak\" aspect of social constructivism, and wants to spend effort debating the institutional realities.\n\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes that \"some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, tenure, citizenship, decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Stanley Fish has suggested that baseball's \"balls and strikes\" are social constructions.\n\nBoth Fish and Pinker agree that the sorts of objects indicated here can be described as part of what John Searle calls \"social reality.\" In particular, they are, in Searle's terms, ontologically subjective but epistemologically objective. \"Social facts\" are temporally, ontologically, and logically dependent on \"brute facts.\" For example, \"money\" in the form of its raw materials (rag, pulp, ink) as constituted socially for barter (for example by a banking system) is a social fact of \"money\" by virtue of (i) collectively willing and intending (ii) to impose some particular function (purpose for which), (iii) by constitutive rules atop the \"brute facts.\" \"Social facts have the remarkable feature of having no analogue among physical brute facts\" (34). The existence of language is itself constitutive of the social fact (37), which natural or brute facts do not require. Natural or \"brute\" facts exist independently of language; thus a \"mountain\" is a mountain in every language and in no language; it simply is what it is.\n\nSearle illustrates the evolution of social facts from brute facts by the constitutive rule: X counts as Y in C. \"The Y terms has to assign a new \"status\" that the object does not already have just in virtue of satisfying the Y term; and there has to be collective agreement, or at least acceptance, both in the imposition of that status on the stuff referred to by the X term and about the function that goes with that status. Furthermore, because the physical features brute facts specified by the X term are insufficient by themselves to guarantee the fulfillment of the assigned function specified by the Y term, the new status and its attendant functions have to be the sort of things that can be constituted by collective agreement or acceptance.\"\n\nIt is true or false that language is not a \"brute fact,\" that it is an institutional fact, a human convention, a metaphysical reality (that happens to be physically uttered), but Searle points out that there are language-independent thoughts \"noninstitutional, primitive, biological inclinations and cognitions not requiring any linguistic devices,\" and that there are many \"brute facts\" amongst both humans and animals that are truths that should not be altered in the social constructs because language does not truly constitute them, despite the attempt to institute them for any group's gain: money and property are language dependent, but desires (thirst, hunger) and emotions (fear, rage) are not. (Descartes describes the difference between imagination as a sort of vision, or image, and intellect as conceptualizing things by symbolic manipulation.) Therefore, there is doubt that society or a computer can be completely programmed by language and images, (because there is a programmable, emotive effect of images that derives from the language of judgment towards images).\n\nFinally, against the strong theory and for the weak theory, Searle insists, \"it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] facts, that there are no brute facts, because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all facts are institutional [i.e., social] would produce an infinite regress or circularity in the account of institutional facts. In order that some facts are institutional, there must be other facts that are brute [i.e., physical, biological, natural]. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.\".\n\nIan Hacking, Canadian philosopher of science, insists, \"the notion that everything is socially constructed has been going the rounds. John Searle [1995] argues vehemently (and in my opinion cogently) against universal constructionism.\" \"Universal social constructionism is descended from the doctrine that I once named linguistic idealism and attributed, only half in jest, to Richard Nixon [Hacking, 1975, p. 182]. Linguistic idealism is the doctrine that only what is talked about exists, nothing has reality until it is spoken of, or written about. This extravagant notion is descended from Berkeley's idea-ism, which we call idealism: the doctrine that all that exists is mental.\" \"They are a part of what John Searle [1995] calls social reality. His book is titled the \"Construction of Social Reality,\" and as I explained elsewhere [Hacking, 1996], that is not a \"social\" construction book at all.\"\n\nHacking observes, \"the label 'social constructionism' is more code than description\" of every Leftist, Marxist, Freudian, and Feminist PostModernist to call into question every moral, sex, gender, power, and deviant claim as just another essentialist claim—including the claim that members of the male and female sex are inherently different, rather than historically and socially constructed. Hacking observes that his 1995 simplistic dismissal of the concept actually revealed to many readers the outrageous implications of the theorists: Is child abuse a real evil, or a social construct, asked Hacking? His dismissive attitude, \"gave some readers a way to see that there need be no clash between construction and reality,\" inasmuch as \"the metaphor of social construction once had excellent shock value, but now it has become tired.\"\n\nInformally, they require human practices to sustain their existence, but they have an effect that is (basically) universally agreed upon. The disagreement lies in whether this category should be called \"socially constructed.\" Ian Hacking argues that it should not. Furthermore, it is not clear that authors who write \"social construction\" analyses ever mean \"social construction\" in Pinker's sense. \". If they never do, then Pinker (probably among others) has misunderstood the point of a social constructionist argument.\n\nTo understand how weak social constructionism can conclude that metaphysics (a human affair) is not the entire \"reality,\" see the arguments against the study of metaphysics. This inability to accurately share the \"full\" reality, even given time for a rational conversation, is similarly proclaimed by \"weak artificial intelligence\".\n\nConstructionism became prominent in the U.S. with Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann's 1966 book, \"The Social Construction of Reality\". Berger and Luckmann argue that all knowledge, including the most basic, taken-for-granted common sense knowledge of everyday reality, is derived from and maintained by social interactions. When people interact, they do so with the understanding that their respective perceptions of reality are related, and as they act upon this understanding their common knowledge of reality becomes reinforced. Since this common sense knowledge is negotiated by people, human typifications, significations and institutions come to be presented as part of an objective reality, particularly for future generations who were not involved in the original process of negotiation. For example, as parents negotiate rules for their children to follow, those rules confront the children as externally produced \"givens\" that they cannot change. Berger and Luckmann's social constructionism has its roots in phenomenology. It links to Heidegger and Edmund Husserl through the teaching of Alfred Schutz, who was also Berger's PhD adviser.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, social constructionist theory underwent a transformation as constructionist sociologists engaged with the work of Michel Foucault and others as a narrative turn in the social sciences was worked out in practice. This particularly affected the emergent sociology of science and the growing field of science and technology studies. In particular, Karin Knorr-Cetina, Bruno Latour, Barry Barnes, Steve Woolgar, and others used social constructionism to relate what science has typically characterized as objective facts to the processes of social construction, with the goal of showing that human subjectivity imposes itself on those facts we take to be objective, not solely the other way around. A particularly provocative title in this line of thought is Andrew Pickering's \"Constructing Quarks: A Sociological History of Particle Physics\". At the same time, Social Constructionism shaped studies of technology – the Sofield, especially on the Social construction of technology, or SCOT, and authors as Wiebe Bijker, Trevor Pinch, Maarten van Wesel, etc. Despite its common perception as objective, mathematics is not immune to social constructionist accounts. Sociologists such as Sal Restivo and Randall Collins, mathematicians including Reuben Hersh and Philip J. Davis, and philosophers including Paul Ernest have published social constructionist treatments of mathematics.\n\nSocial constructionism can be seen as a source of the postmodern movement, and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to social constructionism. Within the social constructionist strand of postmodernism, the concept of socially constructed reality stresses the ongoing mass-building of worldviews by individuals in dialectical interaction with society at a time. The numerous realities so formed comprise, according to this view, the imagined worlds of human social existence and activity, gradually crystallized by habit into institutions propped up by language conventions, given ongoing legitimacy by mythology, religion and philosophy, maintained by therapies and socialization, and subjectively internalized by upbringing and education to become part of the identity of social citizens.\n\nIn the book \"The Reality of Social Construction\", the British sociologist Dave Elder-Vass places the development of social constructionism as one outcome of the legacy of postmodernism. He writes \"Perhaps the most widespread and influential product of this process [coming to terms with the legacy of postmodernism] is social constructionism, which has been booming [within the domain of social theory] since the 1980s.\"\n\nSocial constructionism falls toward the nurture end of the spectrum of the larger nature and nurture debate. Consequently, critics have argued that it generally ignores biological influences on behaviour or culture, or suggests that they are unimportant to achieve an understanding of human behaviour. The view of most psychologists and social scientists is that behaviour is a complex outcome of both biological and cultural influences. Other disciplines, such as evolutionary psychology, behaviour genetics, behavioural neuroscience, epigenetics, etc., take a nature–nurture interactionism approach to understand behaviour or cultural phenomena.\n\nIn 1996, to illustrate what he believed to be the intellectual weaknesses of social constructionism and postmodernism, physics professor Alan Sokal submitted an article to the academic journal \"Social Text\" deliberately written to be incomprehensible but including phrases and jargon typical of the articles published by the journal. The submission, which was published, was an experiment to see if the journal would \"publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions.\" The Postmodernism Generator is a computer program that is designed to produce similarly incomprehensible text. In 1999, Sokal, with coauthor Jean Bricmont published the book \"Fashionable Nonsense\", which criticized postmodernism and social constructionism.\n\nPhilosopher Paul Boghossian has also written against social constructionism. He follows Ian Hacking's argument that many adopt social constructionism because of its potentially liberating stance: if things are the way that they are only because of our social conventions, as opposed to being so naturally, then it should be possible to change them into how we would rather have them be. He then states that social constructionists argue that we should refrain from making absolute judgements about what is true and instead state that something is true in the light of this or that theory. Countering this, he states:\nLater in the same work, Boghossian severely constrains the requirements of relativism. He states that instead of believing that any world view is just as true as any other (cultural relativism), we should believe that:\nWoolgar and Pawluch argue that constructionists tend to 'ontological gerrymander' social conditions in and out of their analysis. Following this point, Thibodeaux argued that constructionism can both separate and combine a subject and their effective environment. To resolve this he argued that objective conditions should be used when analyzing how perspectives are motivated.\n\nSocial constructionism has been criticized by psychologists such as University of Toronto Professor Jordan Peterson and evolutionary psychologists, including Steven Pinker in his book \"The Blank Slate\". John Tooby and Leda Cosmides used the term \"standard social science model\" to refer to social-science philosophies that they argue fail to take into account the evolved properties of the brain.\n\n\n\n"}

Recy Taylor and Rosa Parks founded the committee in 1944 after six white men kidnapped and raped Taylor, an African-American woman, as she left her Abbeville, Alabama church. Taylor's case garnered heavy media coverage. With this attention came national support, which led to what the \"Chicago Defender\" called the \"strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.\" Committee members formed eighteen chapters across the United States, and included such figures as WEB DuBois, Mary Church Terrell, Oscar Hammerstein II, John Sengstacke and Langston Hughes, among others.\n\nClose to midnight on September 3, 1944, six white male assailants stopped Recy Taylor, Fannie Daniels, and West Daniels as they returned home from church in Abbeville, Alabama. The assailants claimed that they recognized Taylor, and that she was wanted for a crime. Taylor had been with the Daniels all day, and thus could not have been involved in the crime as they claimed. At gun and knife point, they kidnapped Taylor, drove her to a secluded area and raped her. Following the assault, they left Taylor to stumble home blindfolded. Taylor’s father and a deputy sheriff found her; she then described the car to the deputy. The Sheriff’s Department identified Hugo Wilson as the driver, and took him into custody. Wilson named the other men involved in the assault, and the Department released him. Taylor and her husband filed charges, but the all-white grand jury dismissed the case on October 4, 1944.\n\nIn 1944, Rosa Parks traveled to Abbeville, Alabama after hearing about Taylor’s assault. The threat of police intervention prompted Parks to meet Recy Taylor, her husband, and her daughter in a secluded cabin. After Deputy Sheriff Lewey Corbitt ended their secret meeting, Parks recorded Taylor’s notes of the assault and brought them to African-American activists in Montgomery. Drawing on years of activism in which she defended the Scottsboro Boys, fought against the Ku Klux Klan, and joined the NAACP, Rosa Parks allied with the Southern Negro Youth Congress to publicize Taylor’s case.\nRosa Parks gathered the support of E.D. Nixon (the Head of the Alabama Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters), Rufus A. Lewis (funeral home director and Alabama State football coach), and E.G. Jackson (editor of Alabama Tribune) and formed the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs. Recy Taylor. By 1945, the case had gained national attention, and the Committee established branches established in New York, and expanded to Denver, Chicago and Detroit.\n\nIn her role as secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, Rosa Parks traveled throughout Alabama collecting testimonies and documenting racially motivated crimes, such as police brutality, unsolved murders, voter intimidation, and rape. Upon coming across Taylor’s story, Parks and other prominent activists, supported by national labor unions, African-American organizations and women’s groups launched a defense team, initially called the Alabama Committee for Equal Justice for Mrs. Recy Taylor. Many well-known activists at the time signed on to the committee, including E.D. Nixon, E.G. Jackson, W.E.B. DuBois, Mary Church Terrell, Charlotte Hawkins Brown, Ira De A. Reid, John Sengstacke, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Lillian Smith, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Henrietta Buckmaster.\n\nThe Committee for Equal Justice spearheaded the campaign for securing justice for Recy Taylor. The Committee sent delegates to Abbeville, Alabama to investigate the crime. The Committee led a publicity campaign to illuminate the prevalence of white attacks on black women. This campaign targeted Alabama Governor Chauncey Sparks, who previously supported laws that hindered Blacks’ from registering to vote. Letters and petitions poured into Sparks’ office demanding that he take action against Taylor’s assailants. Newspapers across the country covered the story of Recy Taylor’s assault. After a considerable amount of public pressure, Governor Sparks reluctantly agreed to launch a special grand jury investigation. The grand jury acquitted all of the assailants.\n\nJ.B. Matthews, a staffer for the House Un-American Activities Committee vilified The Committee for Equal Justice. Matthews claimed that communists led the committee, who were using the campaign to exploit the rape of Taylor. While some members of the committee were communists, the Committee was a platform for civil rights and included many non-communists too. Additionally, some local whites claimed that Taylor was a prostitute whose true intent was to start a race war. Consequently, she received death threats and her house was firebombed.\n\nAlthough there were no indictments in Recy Taylor’s case, the Committee for Equal Justice’s nonviolent activism created a foundation for the formal civil rights movement. Sikivu Hutchinson, author of “White Nights, Black Paradise” assessed the significance of the Committee for Equal Justice and Recy Taylor by saying, “Her case became a major catalyst for black women’s civil rights resistance and the intersectional connection between sexual violence and state violence.” Feminist scholars assert that this case illuminates the important roles African American women played during the civil rights movement, which is often eclipsed in history books by the contributions of male figures such as Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nThe Committee for Equal Justice successfully brought national attention to sexual assault of black women that was widespread in the South. The Committee for Equal Justice empowered women to report acts of sexual violence directly to the NAACP, in addition to writing letters to the Justice Department.\n\nLeaders of the Committee for Equal Justice like Rosa Parks and E. D. Nixon later went on to form the Montgomery Improvement Association. The activists who comprised the committee were responsible for the Montgomery Bus Boycotts. During the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Rosa Parks described her activism in Montgomery as being inspired by her work with the Committee for Equal Justice.\n\nIn 2011, Alabama governor Robert Bentley signed a resolution passed by the Alabama state legislature apologizing to Taylor.\n\n"}

Packer on October 2, 1976, at the priesthood session of the 146th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The sermon is addressed to young men of the Aaronic priesthood (ages 12 to 18) and discusses issues of human sexuality, puberty, and morality. From 1980 to 2016, the sermon was published as a pamphlet by the LDS Church. It has been criticized on various grounds, such as that it encourages violence against homosexuals. In 2016, the church discontinued the pamphlet.\n\nPacker described his remarks as matters that \"fathers should discuss with their sons.\" Packer stated that \"because some young men do not have fathers and because some fathers (and some bishops) do not know how to proceed\", he would be addressing sensitive subjects. The sermon compares the male reproductive system to a \"little factory\" and teaches that masturbation, use of pornography, and homosexual activities are immoral and forbidden by God. It encourages young male Latter-day Saints to \"vigorously resist\" homosexual advances, even with violence, if necessary. Packer teaches that nocturnal emission is natural and designed by God and that young men \"should not feel guilty\" when it happens. The sermon also offers suggestions on how to control one's thoughts and resist temptation.\n\nUnlike most general conference sermons, \"Message to Young Men\" was not published in the church's official magazine, \"The Ensign.\" Instead, the sermon was published in 1980 as a 14-page pamphlet, entitled \"To Young Men Only\", that was available for church leaders to distribute to members.\n\nIn 2016, the pamphlet was discontinued and it was removed from the LDS Church's website. The video of the sermon remains available on the LDS Church's website.\n\nOne controversial part of the sermon states that some men entice others to join them in sexual behaviors and gives an example of a missionary who punched his companion to the floor for making sexual advances to which Packer responded, \"Somebody had to do it\". The audience is heard laughing after this statement in the original broadcast. \n\nIn 2001, gay Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn described the sermon as \"[t]he low point in the Mormon hierarchy's homophobia since the 1950s\"; Quinn argued that Packer's words constituted an endorsement of gay bashing and that the church itself endorsed such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech. \n\nIn 2000 and 2001, David E. Hardy, a Salt Lake City lawyer who is the father of a gay son, criticized the sermon for \"demoniz[ing]\" gays and implying that \"homosexuality is a matter of choice\". \n\nIn 2014, Samantha Allen, a columnist for \"The Daily Beast\", wrote that the sermon \"typifies organized religion’s approach to curtailing male masturbation\", calling it \"deeply paternalistic\" and criticizing it for employing \"a noxious mixture of condescension and euphemism\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19678111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19678111", "title": "Ultimate attribution error", "text": "Ultimate attribution error\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is a group-level attribution error that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in ingroup and outgroup members. \nUltimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their personality, and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication \"The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice\". As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of Gordon Allport's work in attribution theory.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly genetically determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) \"exceptional case\", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.\n\nIn general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and stereotypes toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other races, religions, cultures, or even social class as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted.\n\nThe attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived locus of control of act (internal vs external).\n\nThe \"exceptional case\" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the \"good\" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as \"bad\".\n\nThe \"luck or special advantage\" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. \"Special advantage\" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance.\n\nThe \"highly motivated\" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member.\n\nSimilar to the \"exceptional case\" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.\n\nThe \"situational\" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.\n\nThe ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members. In a 2x2 between-group design, Hindu or Muslim participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups.\n\nPrior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that White participants viewed Black individuals as more violent than White individuals in an \"ambiguous shove\" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person. In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).\n\nMorris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant. In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.\n\nTogether, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.\n\nSupporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990. The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:\n\n"}

The situation imagined is that several individuals go out to eat, and prior to ordering, they agree to split the check equally between all of them. Each individual must now choose whether to order the expensive or inexpensive dish. It is presupposed that the expensive dish is better than the cheaper, but not by enough to warrant paying the difference when eating alone. Each individual reasons that the expense s/he adds to their bill by ordering the more expensive item is very small, and thus the improved dining experience is worth the money. However, having all reasoned thus, they all end up paying for the cost of the more expensive meal, which by assumption, is worse for everyone than having ordered and paid for the cheaper meal.\n\nLet \"a\" represent the joy of eating the expensive meal, \"b\" the joy of eating the cheap meal, \"k\" is the cost of the expensive meal, \"l\" the cost of the cheap meal, and \"n\" the number of players. From the description above we have the following ordering formula_1. Also, in order to make the game sufficiently similar to the Prisoner's dilemma we presume that one would prefer to order the expensive meal given others will help defray the cost, formula_2\n\nConsider an arbitrary set of strategies by a player's opponent. Let the total cost of the other players' meals be \"x\". The cost of ordering the cheap meal is formula_3 and the cost of ordering the expensive meal is formula_4. So the utilities for each meal are formula_5 for the expensive meal and formula_6 for the cheaper meal. By assumption, the utility of ordering the expensive meal is higher. Remember that the choice of opponents' strategies was arbitrary and that the situation is symmetric. This proves that the expensive meal is strictly dominant and thus the unique Nash equilibrium.\n\nIf everyone orders the expensive meal all of the diners pay \"k\" and their total utility is formula_7. On the other hand, if all the individuals had ordered the cheap meal, their utility would have been formula_8. Since by assumption formula_9, everyone would be better off. This demonstrates the similarity between the diner's dilemma and the prisoner's dilemma. Like the prisoner's dilemma, everyone is worse off by playing the unique equilibrium than they would have been if they collectively pursued another strategy.\n\nGneezy, Haruvy, and Yafe (2004) tested these results in a field experiment. Groups of six diners faced different billing arrangements. In one arrangement the diners pay individually, in the second they split the bill evenly between themselves and in the third the meal is paid entirely by the experimenter. As predicted, the consumption is the smallest when the payment is individually made, the largest when the meal is free and in-between for the even split. In a fourth arrangement, each participant pays only one sixth of their individual meal and the experimenter pay the rest, to account for possible unselfishness and social considerations. There was no difference between the amount consumed by these groups and those splitting the total cost of the meal equally. As the private cost of increased consumption is the same for both treatments but splitting the cost imposes a burden on other group members, this indicates that participants did not take the welfare of others into account when making their choices. This contrasts to a large number of laboratory experiments where subjects face analytically similar choices but the context is more abstract.\n\n\n"}

For Plato and Aristotle, the notion of \"doxa\" meant \"opinion\".\n\nThe term grew in popular usage in the work of Edmund Husserl whose phenomenological project was indexed on attempting, via the descriptive method, to ground the notion of a proto-doxa or \"urdoxa\" of experience. The term has since paled in poststructuralist discourse, and usually carries a negative connotation insofar as it assumes a transcendental subjectivity which overly privileges a humanistic conception of Being (see Michel Foucault, \"The Order of Things\"). Against such anthropocentricity, the term has fallen into relative disuse.\n\nTwo other notable uses of the term have appeared insince the year 2000: a progressive musical ensemble by the name of Thork produced an album entitled \"Urdoxa\" (2000), and a novel by the Canadian author Kane X. Faucher also has this term as its title (2004).\n"}

The founder of graphical methods of statistics, Playfair invented several types of diagrams: in 1786 the line, area and bar chart of economic data, and in 1801 the pie chart and circle graph, used to show part-whole relations. As secret agent, Playfair reported on the French Revolution and organized a clandestine counterfeiting operation in 1793 to collapse the French currency.\n\nPlayfair was born in 1759 in Scotland. He was the fourth son (named after his grandfather) of the Reverend James Playfair of the parish of Liff & Benvie near the city of Dundee in Scotland; his notable brothers were architect James Playfair and mathematician John Playfair. His father died in 1772 when William was 13, leaving the eldest brother John to care for the family and his education. After his apprenticeship with Andrew Meikle, the inventor of the threshing machine, Playfair became draftsman and personal assistant to James Watt at the Boulton and Watt steam engine manufactory in Soho, Birmingham.\n\nPlayfair had a variety of careers. He was in turn a millwright, engineer, draftsman, accountant, inventor, silversmith, merchant, investment broker, economist, statistician, pamphleteer, translator, publicist, land speculator, convict, banker, ardent royalist, editor, blackmailer and journalist. On leaving Watt's company in 1782, he set up a silversmithing business and shop in London, which failed. In 1787 he moved to Paris, taking part in the storming of the Bastille two years later. After the French revolution, Playfair played a role in the Scioto Land sale to French settlers in the Ohio River Valley. He returned to London in 1793, where he opened a \"security bank\", which also failed. From 1775 he worked as a writer and pamphleteer and did some engineering work. In the 1790s, Playfair informed the British government on events in France and proposed various clandestine operations to bring down the French government.\n\nIan Spence and Howard Wainer in 2001 describe Playfair as \"engineer, political economist and scoundrel\" while \"Eminent Scotsmen\" calls him an \"ingenious mechanic and miscellaneous writer\". It compares his career with the glorious one of his older brother John Playfair, the distinguished Edinburgh mathematics professor, and draws a moral about the importance of \"steadiness and consistency of plan\" as well as of \"genius\". Bruce Berkowitz in 2018 provides a detailed portrait of Playfair as an \"ambitious, audacious, and woefully imperfect British patriot\" who undertook the \"most complex covert operation anyone had ever conceived\".\n\nTwo decades before Playfair's first achievements, in 1765 Joseph Priestley had created the innovation of the first timeline charts, in which individual bars were used to visualise the life span of a person, and the whole can be used to compare the life spans of multiple persons. According to James R. Beniger and Robyn (1978) \"Priestley's timelines proved a commercial success and a popular sensation, and went through dozens of editions\".\n\nThese timelines directly inspired Wiliam Playfair's invention of the bar chart, which first appeared in his \"Commercial and Political Atlas\", published in 1786. According to Beniger and Robyn (1978) \"Playfair was driven to this invention by a lack of data. In his Atlas he had collected a series of 34 plates about the import and export from different countries over the years, which he presented as line graphs or surface charts: line graphs shaded or tinted between abscissa and function. Because Playfair lacked the necessary series data for Scotland, he graphed its trade data for a single year as a series of 34 bars, one for each of 17 trading partners\".\n\nIn this bar chart Scotland's imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. \"This bar chart was the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates and tables, or time, as had Priestley's timelines. It constitutes a pure solution to the problem of discrete quantitative comparison\".\n\nThe idea of representing data as a series of bars had earlier (14th century) been published by Jacobus de Sancto Martino and attributed to Nicole Oresme. Oresme used the bars to generate a graph of velocity against continuously varying time. Playfair's use of bars was to generate a chart of discrete measurements.\n\nPlayfair, who argued that charts communicated better than tables of data, has been credited with inventing the line, bar, area, and pie charts. His time-series plots are still presented as models of clarity.\n\nPlayfair first published \"The Commercial and Political Atlas\" in London in 1786. It contained 43 time-series plots and one bar chart, a form apparently introduced in this work. It has been described as the first major work to contain statistical graphs.\n\nPlayfair's \"Statistical Breviary,\" published in London in 1801, contains what is generally credited as the first pie chart.\n\nIn 1793 Playfair as secret agent devised a clandestine plan that he presented to Henry Dundas, who was Home Secretary soon to become Britain's Secretary of State for War. Playfair proposed to \"fabricate one hundred millions of assignats (the French currency) and spread them in France by every means in my power.\" He saw the counterfeiting plan as the lessor of two evils: \"That there are two ways of combatting the French nation the forces of which are measured by men and money. Their assignats are their money and it is better to destroy this paper founded upon an iniquitous extortion and a villainous deception than to shed the blood of men.\" Playfair forged the assignats at Haughton Castle in Northumberland and distributed them according to an elaborate plan. The plan apparently worked: by 1795 the French assignat had became worthless and the ensuing chaos undermined the French government. Playfair never told anyone about the operation.\n\nThe following quotation, known as the \"Playfair cycle,\" has achieved notoriety as it pertains to the \"Tytler cycle\":\n\n"}
