{"id": "4463070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4463070", "title": "Abstractionism", "text": "Abstractionism\n\nAbstractionism is the theory that the mind obtains some or all of its concepts by abstracting them from concepts it already has, or from experience. One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other properties. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by George Berkeley and Peter Geach.\n\nAbstractionism has its roots in Aristotle's writings, particularly those rejecting the Platonic theory of Forms. They were adopted and developed further by the Scholastics so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century. John Locke also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences. For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things. His theory contradicts the empiricist standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.\n\nThere are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor, who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts. Chomsky, for instance, explained the \"deep structure\" of the Internet or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that \"linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction.\" \n\nBerkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word \"triangle\" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.\n"}
{"id": "301496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301496", "title": "Advaita Vedanta", "text": "Advaita Vedanta\n\nAdvaita Vedanta (; , IAST: ', literally, \"not-two\"), originally known as Puruṣavāda\"', is a school of Hindu philosophy and religious practice, and one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization. The term \"Advaita\" refers to its idea that the soul (true Self, Atman) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality (Brahman). The followers of this school are known as \"Advaita Vedantins\", or just \"Advaitins\", and they seek spiritual liberation through acquiring \"vidyā\", meaning knowledge, of one's true identity as \"Atman\", and the identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta traces its roots in the oldest Upanishads. It relies on three textual sources called the Prasthanatrayi. It gives \"a unifying interpretation of the whole body of Upanishads\", the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita. Advaita Vedanta is the oldest extant sub-school of Vedanta, which is one of the six orthodox (\"āstika\") Hindu philosophies (). Although its roots trace back to the 1st millennium BCE, the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedanta is considered by the tradition to be 8th century scholar Adi Shankara.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta emphasizes \"Jivanmukti\", the idea that \"moksha\" (freedom, liberation) is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize \"videhamukti\", or \"moksha\" after death. The school uses concepts such as Brahman, Atman, Maya, Avidya, meditation and others that are found in major Indian religious traditions, but interprets them in its own way for its theories of moksha. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Many scholars describe it as a form of monism, others describe the \"Advaita\" philosophy as non-dualistic.\n\nAdvaita influenced and was influenced by various traditions and texts of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, other sub-schools of Vedanta, Vaishnavism, Shaivism, the Puranas, the Agamas, as well as social movements such as the Bhakti movement. Beyond Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta interacted and developed with the other traditions of India such as Jainism and Buddhism. Advaita Vedanta texts espouse a spectrum of views from idealism, including illusionism, to realist or nearly realist positions expressed in the early works of Shankara. In modern times, its views appear in various Neo-Vedanta movements. It has been termed as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta school has been historically referred to by various names, such as \"Advaita-vada\" (speaker of Advaita), \"Abheda-darshana\" (view of non-difference), \"Dvaita-vada-pratisedha\" (denial of dual distinctions), and \"Kevala-dvaita\" (non-dualism of the isolated).\n\nAccording to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term \"Advaita\" first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of Mandukya Upanishad. In contrast, according to Frits Staal, a professor of Philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word \"Advaita\" is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya (8th or 7th-century BCE) is credited to be the one who coined it. Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the \"Advaita\" containing verse excerpt in \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\", as follows:\nAdvaita is a subschool of Vedanta, the latter being one of the six classical Hindu \"darśanas\". It, like nearly all these philosophies, has an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices for what Hinduism considers four proper aims of life: virtue (\"dharma\"), material prosperity (\"artha\"), desire (\"kama\") and the fourth and final aim being \"moksha\", the spiritual liberation or release from cycles of rebirth (samsara). Traditional Advaita Vedanta centers on the study of the \"sruti\" especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nWithin the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism are many sub-schools, of which Advaita is one. Unlike Buddhism, but like Jainism, all Vedanta schools consider the existence of Atman (real self, soul) as self-evident. The Vedanta tradition also posits the concept of Brahman as the eternal, unchanging metaphysical reality. The sub-schools of Vedanta disagree on the relation between \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\". The Advaita \"darsana\" considers them to be identical.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta believes that the knowledge of one's true self or Atman is liberating. Along with self-knowledge, it teaches that \"moksha\" can be achieved by the correct understanding of one's true identity as Ātman, the dispassionate and unmoveable observer, and the identity of Ātman and Brahman.\n\nThe process of acquiring this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, is essentially the same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as \"anubhava\", immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self-knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness \"of Brahman\", but instead an awareness that \"is Brahman\", since one will transcend any form of duality in this state of consciousness.\n\nCorrect knowledge, which destroys \"avidya\", psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained through three stages of practice, \"sravana\" (hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation).\n\nThe Vedanta tradition of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the efficient cause of all existence while Prakriti is its material cause. Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause, \"that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed.\" What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always. This Brahman it postulates is \"sat-cit-ananda\" (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for: first, how did \"sat\" Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did \"cit\" Brahman create material world? third, if \"ananda\" Brahman is pure bliss, why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.\n\nAdvaita establishes its truths, in part, from the oldest Principal Upanishads (\"sruti\"), the Brahma Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita and numerous other Hindu texts. Reason is used to support revelation, the \"sruti\", the ultimate source of truth. Reason clarifies the truth and removes objections, according to the Advaita school, however it believes that pure logic cannot lead to philosophical truths and only experience and meditative insights do. The \"Sruti\", it believes is a collection of experience and meditative insights about liberating knowledge. The Advaita literature also provide a criticism of opposing systems, including the dualistic school of Hinduism, as well as non-Hindu philosophies such as Buddhism.\n\nAdvaita, like other schools, accepts Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life as natural and proper:\n\nOf these, much of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy focuses on the last, gaining liberation in one's current life. The first three are discussed and encouraged by Advaitins, but usually in the context of knowing Brahman and Self-realization.\n\nThe soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of Atman and Brahman. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to liberation, Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is stated by Shankara as follows:\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called \"Jivanmukti\". The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought. Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman.\n\nAccording to Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\"\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta, the interest is not in liberation in after life, but in one's current life. This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves this is called a \"Jivanmukta\".\n\nThe concept of \"Jivanmukti\" of Advaita Vedanta contrasts with \"Videhamukti\" (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta. Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, after which the liberated individual shows attributes such as:\n\n\"Sruti\" (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (\"vidya\") for the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by \"svādhyāya\", study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: \"sravana\" (perception, hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation), a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\".\n\n\"Sravana\" literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher (guru), wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers. \"Manana\" refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on \"svadhyaya\" and \"sravana\". \"Nididhyāsana\" refers to meditation, realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being. Bilimoria states that these three stages of Advaita practice can be viewed as \"sadhana\" practice that unifies \"Yoga\" and \"Karma\" ideas, and was most likely derived from these older traditions.\n\nAdi Shankara uses \"anubhava\" interchangeably with \"pratipatta\", \"understanding\". Dalal and others state that \"anubhava\" does not center around some sort of \"mystical experience,\" but around the correct knowledge of Brahman. Nikhalananda states that (knowledge of) \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\" can only be reached by \"buddhi\", \"reason,\" stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while \"buddhi\" is the highest means of attaining knowledge.\n\nSeveral \"Mahavakyas\", or \"the great sentences\", have Advaitic theme, that is \"the inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are one and the same\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature, but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's Upadesasahasri and the Vivekachudamani, which is also attributed to Shankara.\n\nClassical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of fourfold qualities, or behavioral qualifications (\"Samanyasa\", \"Sampattis\", \"sādhana-catustaya\"):\n\nCorrect knowledge, which destroys \"avidya\", psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman, is obtained in \"jnanayoga\" through three stages of practice, \"sravana\" (hearing), \"manana\" (thinking) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation). This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\":\n\nWhile Shankara emphasized sravana (\"hearing\"), manana (\"reflection\") and nididhyasana (\"repeated meditation\"), later texts like the \"Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka\" (14th century) and \"Vedantasara (of Sadananda)\" (15th century) added samadhi as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta school has traditionally had a high reverence for Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality. However, the Guru is not mandatory in Advaita school, states Clooney, but reading of Vedic literature and followed by reflection is. Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words \"such as \"Sastracaryopadesa\" (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and \"Vedantacaryopadesa\" (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru\". This reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization.\n\nA guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the \"guru\" serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student. The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a \"counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life.\"\n\nThe classical Advaita Vedanta explains all reality and everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, and there is no dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its theory of errors (\"anirvacaniya khyati\").\n\nShankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion:\n\nAdvaita Vedanta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This \"absolute and relative truths\" explanation, Advaitins call as the \"two truths\" doctrine. John Grimes, a professor of Indian Religions specializing on Vedanta, explains this Advaita doctrine with the example of light and darkness. From sun's perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and \"all is light\". From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not \"all is light\", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedanta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives.\n\nAs they developed these theories, Advaita Vedanta scholars were influenced by some ideas from the Nyaya, Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy. These theories have not enjoyed universal consensus among Advaitins, and various competing ontological interpretations have flowered within the Advaita tradition.\n\nAdvaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings, and correspond to the Three Bodies Doctrine:\n\nAdvaita also posits the fourth state of Turiya, which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (\"ananta\") and non-different (\"advaita/abheda\"), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the \"Jivanmukta\".\n\nAdvaita traces the foundation of this ontological theory in more ancient Sanskrit texts. For example, chapters 8.7 through 8.12 of Chandogya Upanishad discuss the \"four states of consciousness\" as awake, dream-filled sleep, deep sleep, and beyond deep sleep. One of the earliest mentions of \"Turiya\", in the Hindu scriptures, occurs in verse 5.14.3 of the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\". The idea is also discussed in other early Upanishads.\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the highest Reality, That which is unborn and unchanging, and \"not sublatable\", and cannot be superseded by a still higher reality. Other than \"Brahman\", everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is \"Paramarthika Satyam\", \"Absolute Truth\", and\nIn Advaita, Brahman is the substrate and cause of all changes. Brahman is considered to be the material cause and the efficient cause of all that exists. Brahman is the \"primordial reality that creates, maintains and withdraws within it the universe.\" It is the \"creative principle which lies realized in the whole world\".\n\nAdvaita's Upanishadic roots state Brahman's qualities to be \"Sat-cit-ānanda\" (being-consciousness-bliss) It means \"true being-consciousness-bliss,\" or \"Eternal Bliss Consciousness\". Adi Shankara held that \"satcitananda\" is identical with Brahman and Atman. The Advaitin scholar Madhusudana Sarasvati explained Brahman as the Reality that is simultaneously an absence of falsity (sat), absence of ignorance (cit), and absence of sorrow/self-limitation (ananda). According to Adi Shankara, the knowledge of Brahman that Shruti provides cannot be obtained in any other means besides self inquiry.\n\nĀtman (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is a central idea in Hindu philosophy and a foundational premise of Advaita Vedanta. It is a Sanskrit word that means \"real self\" of the individual, \"essence\", and soul.\n\nĀtman is the first principle in Advaita Vedanta, along with its concept of Brahman, with Atman being the perceptible personal particular and Brahman the inferred unlimited universal, both synonymous and interchangeable. It is, to an Advaitin, the unchanging, enduring, eternal absolute. It is the \"true self\" of an individual, a consciousness, states Sthaneshwar Timalsina, that is \"self-revealed, self-evident and self-aware (\"svaprakashata\")\". Atman, states Eliot Deutsch, is the \"pure, undifferentiated, supreme power of awareness\", it is more than thought, it is a state of being, that which is conscious and transcends subject-object divisions and momentariness.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual. It asserts that there is \"spirit, soul, self\" (Atman) within each living entity, which are same as each other and identical to the universal eternal Brahman. It is an experience of \"oneness\" which unifies all beings, in which there is the divine in every being, in which all existence is a single Reality, and in which there is no \"divine\" distinct from the individual Atman.\n\nAtman is not the constantly changing body, not the desires, not the emotions, not the ego, nor the dualistic mind in Advaita Vedanta. It is the introspective, inwardly self-conscious \"on-looker\" (\"saksi\"). To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Atman is identical to Brahman. This is expressed in the \"mahavakya\" \"tat tvam asi\", \"thou are that.\" There is \"a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman.\" Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite. According to Shankara, Atman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical.\n\nMoksha is attained by realizing the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life. This is frequently stated by Advaita scholars, such as Shankara, as:\n\nAccording to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the sole reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an important question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by \"maya\" (constantly changing reality) and \"avidya\" (\"ignorance\"). Other than \"Brahman\", everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore maya. Brahman is \"Paramarthika Satyam\", \"Absolute Truth\", and \"the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (\"sat\"), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable\".\n\nAll schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of \"Satkāryavāda\", which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The \"Brahma Sutras\", the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, support \"Parinamavada\", the idea that the world is a real transformation (\"parinama\") of Brahman.\n\nScholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita system explained causality through \"vivarta\". According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of \"parinama-vada\", the competing causality theory is \"Vivartavada\", which says \"the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (\"vivarta\") of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts\". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. \"Although the world can be described as conventionally real\", adds Nicholson, \"the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated\".\n\nHowever, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate \"Vivartavada\", and his explanations are \"remote from any connotation of illusion\". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to \"Vivarta\", and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position. Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the \"vivarta-vada\" isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to \"parinama-vada\", and the \"vivarta\" explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.\n\nAccording to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from \"the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation\" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.\n\nThe doctrine of Maya is used to explain the empirical reality in Advaita. Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is not what it appears to be\". It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false duality or divisional plurality. The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical reality) and \"Paramarthika\" (absolute, spiritual Reality). Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as Brahman. This theory of māyā was expounded and explained by Adi Shankara. Competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory, and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā. A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, \"Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world.\"\n\nBrahman is the sole metaphysical truth in Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical) and \"Paramarthika\" (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality.\n\nDue to ignorance (), Brahman is perceived as the material world and its objects (nama rupa vikara). According to Shankara, Brahman is in reality attributeless and formless. Brahman, the highest truth and all (Reality), does not really change; it is only our ignorance that gives the appearance of change. Also due to , the true identity is forgotten, and material reality, which manifests at various levels, is mistaken as the only and true reality.\n\nThe notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedanta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness? Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of Adi Shankara's Upadesasahasri:\nTo Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance of this Universal Self, see their \"I-ness\" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.\n\nSubsequent Advaitins gave somewhat various explanations, from which various Advaita schools arose.\n\nThe ancient and medieval texts of Advaita Vedanta and other schools of Hindu philosophy discuss \" Pramana\" (epistemology). The theory of Pramana discusses questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Advaita Vedānta, accepts the following six kinds of :\n\n\"Pratyakṣa\" (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception, is of two types: external - that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal - perception of inner sense, the mind. Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) \"Indriyarthasannikarsa\" (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) \"Avyapadesya\" (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) \"Avyabhicara\" (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) \"Vyavasayatmaka\" (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe). The internal perception concepts included \"pratibha\" (intuition), \"samanyalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and \"jnanalaksanapratyaksa\" (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).\n\n\"Anumāṇa\" (अनुमान), inference, is defined as applying reason to reach a new conclusion about truth from one or more observations and previous understanding of truths. Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of \"Anumana\". This epistemological method for gaining knowledge consists of three parts: 1) \"Pratijna\" (hypothesis), 2) \"Hetu\" (a reason), and 3) \"drshtanta\" (examples). The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts: 1) \"Sadhya\" (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and 2) \"Paksha\" (the object on which the \"Sadhya\" is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if \"Sapaksha\" (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if \"Vipaksha\" (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies further demand \"Vyapti\" - the requirement that the \"hetu\" (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both \"sapaksha\" and \"vipaksha\". A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a \"nigamana\" (conclusion).\n\n\"Upamāṇa\" (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge. \"Upamana\", states Lochtefeld, may be explained with the example of a traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called \"upameyam\", the object of comparison is called \"upamanam\", while the attribute(s) are identified as \"samanya\".\n\n\"Arthāpatti\" (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances. In contemporary logic, this \"pramana\" is similar to circumstantial implication. As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this \"Pramana\" as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted. However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.\n\n\"Anupalabdi\" (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof. \"Anupalabdhi pramana\" suggests that knowing a negative, such as \"there is no jug in this room\" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means. In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either \"sadrupa\" (positive) or \"asadrupa\" (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other \"pramana\", Indian scholars refined \"Anupalabdi\" to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept \"non-perception\" as a \"pramana\". Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five \"pramanas\" fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth. A variation of \"Anupaladbi\", called Abhava (अभाव) has also been posited as an epistemic method. It means non-existence. Some scholars consider \"Anupalabdi\" to be same as \"Abhava\", while others consider \"Anupalabdi\" and \"Abhava\" as different. \"Abhava-pramana\" has been discussed in Advaita in the context of \"Padārtha\" (पदार्थ, referent of a term). A \"Padartha\" is defined as that which is simultaneously \"Astitva\" (existent), \"Jneyatva\" (knowable) and \"Abhidheyatva\" (nameable). \"Abhava\" was further refined in four types, by the schools of Hinduism that accepted it as a useful method of epistemology: \"dhvamsa\" (termination of what existed), \"atyanta-abhava\" (impossibility, absolute non-existence, contradiction), \"anyonya-abhava\" (mutual negation, reciprocal absence) and \"pragavasa\" (prior, antecedent non-existence).\n\n\"Śabda\" (शब्द), relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts. Hiriyanna explains \"Sabda-pramana\" as a concept which means reliable expert testimony. The schools of Hinduism which consider it epistemically valid suggest that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn only a fraction of those facts and truths directly. He must rely on others, his parent, family, friends, teachers, ancestors and kindred members of society to rapidly acquire and share knowledge and thereby enrich each other's lives. This means of gaining proper knowledge is either spoken or written, but through \"Sabda\" (words). The reliability of the source is important, and legitimate knowledge can only come from the \"Sabda\" of reliable sources. The disagreement between Advaita and other schools of Hinduism has been on how to establish reliability.\n\nSome claim, states Deutsch, \"that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character\". However, adds Deutsch, ethics \"does\" have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers \"an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary\". According to Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, there cannot be \"any absolute moral laws, principles or duties\", instead in its axiological view Atman is \"beyond good and evil\", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of \"distinctionless Oneness\" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman. Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own soul and another being's, good and just Karma.\n\nThe values and ethics in Advaita Vedanta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that \"the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self.\" Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to \"a deeper identity and affinity with all\". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens \"the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness\". These ideas are exemplified in the Isha Upanishad – a \"sruti\" for Advaita, as follows:\n\nAdi Shankara, a leading proponent of Advaita, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his \"Upadeśasāhasrī\", asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of Yamas (ethical precepts) such as Ahimsa (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), Satya (truth, abstinence from falsehood), Asteya (abstinence from theft), Aparigraha (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection. Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge, however, Shankara discourages ritual worship and oblations to \"Deva\" (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The \"doctrine of difference\" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, \"he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman\".\n\nElsewhere, in verses 1.26-1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any \"Bheda\" (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge. This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference.\n\nThe Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\" and their changeless nature.\n\nAdi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. Adi Shankara's \"Bhashya\" (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition. The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries.\n\nThe \"Vedanta\" tradition provides exegeses of the \"Upanishads\", the \"Brahma Sutras\", and the \"Bhagavadgita\", collectively called the \"Prasthanatrayi\", literally, \"three sources\".\n\nThe identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\", and their unchanging, eternal nature, are basic truths in Advaita Vedanta. The school considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its \"karma-kanda\" (ritual injunctions). The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman and Brahman are found in the Upanishads, which Advaita Vedanta has regarded as \"errorless revealed truth.\" Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an epistemic premise that Śruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge. The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.\n\nThe possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars. The Brahmasutra (also called Vedanta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining pramanas. This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the Brahmasutra as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta existed prior to Adi Shankara but found in him its most influential expounder.\n\nOf the Vedanta-school before the composition of the Brahma Sutras (400–450 CE), wrote Nakamura in 1950, almost nothing is known. The two Advaita writings of pre-Shankara period, known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, were the \"Vākyapadīya\", written by Bhartṛhari (second half 5th century), and the \"Māndūkya-kārikā\" written by Gaudapada (7th century CE).\n\nScholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook. Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.\n\nThe strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient texts may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early 1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.\n\nThe Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedanta gives an interpretation. The Upanishads do not contain \"a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments\". This philosophical inquiry was performed by the darsanas, the various philosophical schools.\n\nThe Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the \"Vedanta Sutra\", were compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE, but \"the great part of the \"Sutra\" must have been in existence much earlier than that\". Estimates of the date of Bādarāyana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE.\n\nThe Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads. It was and is a guide-book for the great teachers of the Vedantic systems. Bādarāyana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads. He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him:\nAccording to Nakamura, \"there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period, but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today\". In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya. In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya. Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Vedanta philosophy.\n\nThe names of various important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the \"Siddhitraya\" by Yamunācārya (c.1050), the \"Vedārthasamgraha\" by Rāmānuja (c.1050–1157), and the \"Yatīndramatadīpikā\" by Śrīnivāsa-dāsa. Combined together, at least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahman Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.\n\nAlthough Shankara is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedanta school, according to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of these early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought \"were advocated by someone before Śankara\". Shankara \"was the person who synthesized the \"Advaita-vāda\" which had previously existed before him\". In this synthesis, he was the rejuvenator and defender of ancient learning. He was an unequalled commentator, due to whose efforts and contributions the Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.\n\nGaudapada (6th century) was the teacher of Govinda Bhagavatpada and the grandteacher of Shankara. Gaudapada uses the concepts of Ajativada and Maya to establish \"that from the level of ultimate truth the world is a cosmic illusion,\" and \"suggests that the whole of our waking experience is exactly the same as an illusory and insubstantial dream.\" In contrast, Adi Shankara insists upon a distinction between waking experience and dreams.\n\nGaudapada wrote or compiled the ', also known as the ' or the '. The ' is a commentary in verse form on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", one of the shortest Upanishads consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedanta, the oldest surviving complete text is the \"Māṇḍukya Kārikā\". Many other texts with same type of teachings and which were older than \"Māṇḍukya Kārikā\" existed and this is unquestionable because other scholars and their views are cited by Gaudapada, Shankara and Anandagiri, according to Hajime Nakamura. Gaudapada relied particularly on \"Mandukya Upanishad\", as well as \"Brihadaranyaka\" and \"Chandogya Upanishads\".\n\nThe \"Mandukya Upanishad\" was considered to be a Śruti before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important. In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire \"Karika\" became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era.\n\nAround 740 AD Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa, and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.\n\nAdi Shankara (788–820), also known as and , represents a turning point in the development of Vedanta. After the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedanta, culminating in the works of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works, synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita. Using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita Vedanta in the 8th century CE, though the school was founded many centuries earlier by Badarayana. His thematic focus extended beyond metaphysics and soteriology, and he laid a strong emphasis on \"Pramanas\", that is epistemology or \"means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge\". Rambachan, for example, summarizes the widely held view on one aspect of Shankara's epistemology before critiquing it as follows,\nSengaku Mayeda concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (\"vastutantra\"), and considered subjective opinions (\"purushatantra\") and injunctions in Śruti (\"codanatantra\") as secondary. Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (\"pramana-janya\") in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.\n\nAdi Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarked that the \"Anvaya\" (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the \"Samanvayat Tatparya Linga\", that is six characteristics of the text under consideration: \n\nWhile this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of Nyaya school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called \"Anvaya-Vyatireka\", which states that for proper understanding one must \"accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics\" and \"exclude meanings that are incompatible with any\".\n\nHacker and Phillips note that this insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is \"doubtlessly the suggestion\" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada. Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using \"pranamas\" (epistemology), reason and experience.\n\nShankara lived in the time of the so-called \"Late classical Hinduism\", which lasted from 650 to 1100CE. This era was one of political instability that followed Gupta dynasty and King Harsha of the 7thcenturyCE. It was a time of social and cultural change as the ideas of Buddhism, Jainism, and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members. Buddhism in particular influenced India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE. Shankara and his contemporaries made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions; they then transformed the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important tradition for more than a thousand years.\n\nAdi Shankara is best known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (\"Bhasyas\") on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the \"Brahmasutrabhasya\" (literally, commentary on Brahma Sutra), a fundamental text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism. His commentaries on ten Mukhya (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars. Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita (part of his Prasthana Trayi Bhasya).\n\nShankara's \"Vivarana\" (tertiary notes) on the commentary by Vedavyasa on Yogasutras as well as those on Apastamba Dharma-sũtras (\"Adhyatama-patala-bhasya\") are accepted by scholars as authentic works of Adi Shankara. Among the \"Stotra\" (poetic works), the Daksinamurti Stotra, Bhajagovinda Stotra, Sivanandalahari, Carpata-panjarika, Visnu-satpadi, Harimide, Dasa-shloki, and Krishna-staka are likely to be authentic. He also authored Upadesasahasri, his most important original philosophical work. Of other original \"Prakaranas\" (प्रकरण, monographs, treatise), 76 works are attributed to Adi Shankara. Modern era Indian scholars Belvalkar and Upadhyaya accept five and thirty nine works, respectively, as authentic.\n\nSeveral commentaries on Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads have been attributed to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful. Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholars as his works, and are likely works of later Advaita Vedanta scholars; these include the Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, and Gopalatapaniya Upanishad.\n\nThe authenticity of Shankara being the author of has been questioned, and \"modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara.\" The authorship of Shankara of his Mandukya Upanishad \"Bhasya\" and his supplementary commentary on Gaudapada's \"\" has been disputed by Nakamura. However, other scholars state that the commentary on Mandukya, which is actually a commentary on Madukya-Karikas by Gaudapada, may be authentic.\n\nShankara's status in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta is unparallelled. He travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas. His teachings and tradition form the basis of Smartism and have influenced Sant Mat lineages. He introduced the form of worship, the simultaneous worship of five deitiesGanesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi. Shankara explained that all deities were but different forms of the one Brahman, the invisible Supreme Being.\n\nBenedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely Atman and Brahman. Isaeva states that Shankara's influence extended to reforming Hinduism, founding monasteries, edifying disciples, disputing opponents, and engaging in philosophic activity that, in the eyes of Indian tradition, helped revive \"the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings\" and Vedanta thought.\n\nSome scholars doubt Shankara's early influence in India. According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Mandana-Misra, who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita. Other scholars state that the historical records for this period are unclear, and little reliable information is known about the various contemporaries and disciples of Shankara.\n\nSeveral scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of the Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India. Many of Shankara's biographies were created and published in and after the 14th century, such as the widely cited Vidyaranya's Śankara-vijaya. Vidyaranya, also known as Madhava, who was the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380 to 1386, inspired the re-creation of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire of South India in response to the devastation caused by the Islamic Delhi Sultanate. He and his brothers, suggest Paul Hacker and other scholars, wrote about Śankara as well as extensive Advaitic commentaries on the Vedas and Dharma. Vidyaranya was a minister in the Vijayanagara Empire and enjoyed royal support, and his sponsorship and methodical efforts helped establish Shankara as a rallying symbol of values, spread historical and cultural influence of Shankara's Vedanta philosophies, and establish monasteries (\"mathas\") to expand the cultural influence of Shankara and Advaita Vedanta.\n\nSureśvara (fl. 800-900 CE) and Maṇḍana Miśra were contemporaries of Shankara, Sureśvara often (incorrectly) being identified with Maṇḍana Miśra. Both explained Sankara \"on the basis of their personal convictions\". Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nMaṇḍana Miśra was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of Kumarila, but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the \"Brahma-siddhi\". According to tradition, Maṇḍana Miśra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate, after which he became a follower of Shankara. Yet, his attitude toward Shankara was that of a \"self-confident rival teacher of Advaita\", and his influence was such that some regard the \"Brahma-siddhi\" to have \"set forth a non-Shankaran brand of Advaita\"\" The \"theory of error\" set forth in this work became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error. It was Vachaspati Misra's commentary on this work that linked it to Shankara's teaching. His influential thesis in the Advaita tradition has been that errors are opportunities because they \"lead to truth\", and full correct knowledge requires that not only should one understand the truth but also examine and understand errors as well as what is not truth.\n\nHiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra had different views on various doctrinal points:\n\nAfter Shankara's death, several sub-schools developed. Two of them still exist today, the Bhāmatī and the Vivarana. Two defunct schools are the \"Pancapadika\" and \"Istasiddhi\", which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.\n\nThese schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of māyā and avidya.\n\nPadmapada (c. 800 CE) was a direct disciple of Shankara who wrote the \"Pancapadika\", a commentary on the \"Sankara-bhaya\". Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of \"avidya\", designating \"prakrti\" as \"avidya\" or \"ajnana\".\n\nVachaspati Misra (800–900 CE) wrote the \"Brahmatattva-samiksa\", a commentary on Maṇḍana Miśra's \"Brahma-siddhi\", which provides the link between Mandana Misra and Shankara and attempts to harmonise Shankara's thought with that of Mandana Misra. According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Misra \"to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati\". Only two works are known of Vachaspati Misra, the \"Brahmatattva-samiksa\" on Maṇḍana Miśra's \"Brahma-siddhi\", and his \"Bhamati\" on the \"Sankara-bhasya\", Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-sutras. The name of the Bhamati sub-school is derived from this \"Bhamati\".\n\nThe Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the Jiva as the source of avidya. It sees meditation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.\n\nPrakasatman (c. 1200–1300) wrote the \"Pancapadika-Vivarana\", a commentary on the \"Pancapadika\" by Padmapadacharya. The \"Vivarana\" lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmum, \"[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition.\"\n\nThe Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of \"mulavidya\" or \"maya\" as being of \"positive beginningless nature\", and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.\n\nVimuktatman (c. 1200 CE) wrote the \"Ista-siddhi\". It is one of the four traditional \"siddhi\", together with Mandana's \"Brahma-siddhi\", Suresvara's \"Naiskarmya-siddhi\", and Madusudana's \"Advaita-siddhi\". According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is \"pure intuitive consciousness\". His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.\n\nMichael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but \"scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedanta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period.\"\n\nAccording to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in the later Advaita tradition are:\n\nWhile Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an \"orthodox\" Advaita Vedanta, the living Advaita Vedanta tradition in medieaval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the \"Yoga Vasistha\" and the \"Bhagavata Purana\". The \"Yoga Vasistha\" became an authoritative surce text in the Advaita vedanta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidyāraņya's \"Jivanmuktiviveka\" (14th century) was influenced by the \"(Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha\", which in turn was influenced by Kashmir Shaivism. Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on \"nirvikalpa samadhi\" was preceded by medieaval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In thee 16th and 17th centuries, some Nath and hatha yoga texts also came within the scope of the Advaita vedanta tradition.\n\nAlready in medieval times, Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as the highest of the Indian religious philosophies, a development which was reinforced in modern times due to western interest in Advaita Vedanta, and the subsequent influence on western perceptions on Indian perceptions of Hinduism.\n\nIn contrast, King states that its present position was a response of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing \"Hindu inferiority complex\" during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent. The \"humanistic, inclusivist\" formulation, now called Neo-Vedanta, attempted to respond to this colonial stereotyping of \"Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West\", states King. Advaita Vedanta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Vedanta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the Buddha a part of the Vedanta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo-Vedanta developed as a reaction to western Orientalism and Perennialism. With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulation of Advaita Vedanta has \"become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought\", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta came to occupy a central position in the classification of various Hindu traditions. To some scholars, it is with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate thereafter the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity. Between the twelfth and the fourteen century, according to Andrew Nicholson, this effort emerged with a classification of astika and nastika systems of Indian philosophies. Certain thinkers, according to Nicholson thesis, began to retrospectively classify ancient thought into \"six systems\" (\"saddarsana\") of mainstream Hindu philosophy.\n\nOther scholars, acknowledges Nicholson, present an alternate thesis. The scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, texts such as Dharmasutras and Puranas, and various ideas that are considered to be paradigmatic Hinduism are traceable to being thousands of years old. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Hinduism as a religion does not have a single founder, rather it is a fusion of diverse scholarship where a galaxy of thinkers openly challenged each other's teachings and offered their own ideas. The term \"Hindu\" too, states Arvind Sharma, appears in much older texts such as those in Arabic that record the Islamic invasion or regional rule of Indian subcontinent. Some of these texts have been dated to between the 8th and the 11th century. Within these \"doxologies\" and records, Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.\n\nAccording to Sangeetha Menon, Sadaśiva Brahmendra was a prominent 18th century Advaita Vedantin.\n\nAccording to King, along with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule came orientalism wherein the new rulers viewed Indians through \"colonially crafted lenses\". In response, emerged Hindu nationalism for collective action against the colonial rule, against the caricature by Christian and Muslim communities, and for socio-political independence. In this colonial era search of identity, Vedanta came to be regarded as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as \"then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion\" and umbrella of \"inclusivism\". This umbrella of Advaita Vedanta, according to King, \"provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression\".\n\nAmong the colonial era intelligentsia, according to Anshuman Mondal, a professor of Literature specializing in post-colonial studies, the monistic Advaita Vedanta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism. Mahatma Gandhi professed monism of Advaita Vedanta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism. Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedanta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the Muslim League, to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions.\n\nA major proponent in the popularisation of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was Vivekananda, who played a major role in the revival of Hinduism, and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the Ramakrishna Mission. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called \"Neo-Vedanta\". Vivekananda discerned a universal religion, regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth. He presented karma, bhakti, jnana and raja yoga as equal means to attain moksha, to present Vedanta as a liberal and universal religion, in contrast to the exclusivism of other religions.\n\nVivekananda emphasised \"nirvikalpa\" samadhi as the spiritual goal of Vedanta, he equated it to the liberation in Yoga and encouraged Yoga practice he called \"Raja yoga\". This approach, however, is missing in historic Advaita texts. In 1896, Vivekananda claimed that Advaita appeals to modern scientists:\nAccording to Rambachan, Vivekananda interprets \"anubhava\" as to mean \"personal experience\", akin to religious experience, whereas Shankara used the term to denote liberating understanding of the \"sruti\".\n\nVivekananda's claims about spirituality as \"science\" and modern, according to David Miller, may be questioned by well informed scientists, but it drew attention for being very different than how Christianity and Islam were being viewed by scientists and sociologists of his era.\n\nSarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedanta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism. According to Michael Hawley, a professor of Religious Studies, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as \"what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism,\" as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby \"in a sense Hindusizing all religions\". To him, the world faces a religious problem, where there is unreflective dogmatism and exclusivism, creating a need for \"experiential religion\" and \"inclusivism\". Advaita Vedanta, claimed Radhakrishnan, best exemplifies a Hindu philosophical, theological, and literary tradition that fulfills this need. Radhakrishnan did not emphasize the differences between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism versus Hinduism that he defined in terms of Advaita Vedanta, rather he tended to minimize their differences. This is apparent, for example, in his discussions of Buddhist \"Madhyamika and Yogacara\" traditions versus the Advaita Vedanta tradition.\n\nRadhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for contemporary needs and context. He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the transcendent metaphysical absolute concept (\"nirguna\" Brahman). Radhakrishnan also reinterpreted Shankara's notion of \"maya\". According to Radhakrishnan, \"maya\" is not a strict absolute idealism, but \"a subjective misperception of the world as ultimately real.\"\n\nGandhi declared his allegiance to Advaita Vedanta, and was another popularizing force for its ideas. According to Nicholas Gier, this to Gandhi meant the unity of God and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that \"atman\" exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this \"atman\". Gandhi called himself advaitist many times, including his letters, but he believed that others have a right to a viewpoint different than his own because they come from a different background and perspective. According to Gier, Gandhi did not interpret \"maya\" as illusion, but accepted that \"personal theism\" leading to \"impersonal monism\" as two tiers of religiosity.\n\nContemporary teachers are the orthodox Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham; the more traditional teachers Sivananda Saraswati (1887–1963), Chinmayananda Saraswati, and Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya); and less traditional teachers such as Narayana Guru. According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in 20th century Advaita tradition are Shri Chandrashekhara Bharati Mahaswami, Chandrasekharendra Saraswati Swamigal, Sacchidānandendra Saraswati.\n\n\"Neo-Advaita\" is a New Religious Movement based on a popularised, western interpretation of Advaita Vedanta and the teachings of Ramana Maharshi. Neo-Advaita is being criticised for discarding the traditional prerequisites of knowledge of the scriptures and \"renunciation as necessary preparation for the path of \"jnana\"-yoga\". Notable neo-advaita teachers are H. W. L. Poonja, his students Gangaji Andrew Cohen, and Eckhart Tolle.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta has gained attention in western spirituality and New Age, where various traditions are seen as driven by the same non-dual experience. Nonduality points to \"a primordial, natural awareness without subject or object\". It is also used to refer to interconnectedness, \"the sense that all things are interconnected and not separate, while at the same time all things retain their individuality\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is not just a philosophical system, but also a tradition of renunciation. Philosophy and renunciation are closely related:\n\nShankara organized monks under 10 names and established mathas for them. These mathas contributed to the influence of Shankara, which was \"due to institutional factors\". The mathas which he built exist until today, and preserve the teachings and influence of Shankara, \"while the writings of other scholars before him came to be forgotten with the passage of time\".\n\nAround 740 CE, Gaudapada founded Shri Gaudapadacharya Math, also known as . It is located in Kavale, Ponda, Goa, and is the oldest matha of the South Indian Saraswat Brahmins.\n\nShankara, himself considered to be an incarnation of Shiva, established the Dashanami Sampradaya, organizing a section of the Ekadandi monks under an umbrella grouping of ten names.\nSeveral Hindu monastic and Ekadandi traditions, however, remained outside the organisation of the Dasanāmis.\n\nSankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four (Sanskrit: ) (monasteries), called the \"Amnaya Mathas\", with the headquarters at Dvārakā in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrikashrama in the North. Each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then. According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's samadhi at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely Naduvil Madhom, Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the four \"Amnaya Mathas\" founded by Adi Shankara, and their details.\nMonks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures enumerated by Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a Saiva sect, despite the historical links with Shaivism. Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedanta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism) of Ramanuja, and the 14th-century Dvaita (theistic dualism) of Madhvacharya.\n\nRamanuja's Vishishtadvaita school and Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are premised on the assumption that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedanta believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (soul) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the \"nirguna\" Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and \"saguna\" Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and all of the world of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (\"saguna\" Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with \"nirguna\" Brahman.\n\nVallabhacharya (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of Shuddhadvaita Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world. That is why shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss).\n\nMadhvacharya was also a critic of Advaita Vedanta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are identical, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities. Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only Vishnu is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities. Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism were a nihilistic school of thought. Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including \"Upadhikhandana\" and \"Tattvadyota\", primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.\n\nScholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Vedanta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita Vedanta, states Eliot Deutsch, \"has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West\".\n\nThe Smarta tradition of Hinduism is an ancient tradition, particularly found in south and west India, that revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit. Their worship practice is called \"Panchayatana puja\". The worship symbolically consists of five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Devi or Durga, Surya and an Ishta Devata or any personal god of devotee's preference.\n\nIn the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedanta ideas combined with bhakti are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smarta. According to Alf Hiltebeitel, Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the \"smarta\" tradition.\n\nPhilosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues (murti), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality \"saguna Brahman\". The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as \"That art Thou\".\n\nWithin the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, the ideas of Advaita Vedanta have had a major influence. Advaita Vedanta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India. One of its most popular text, the \"Bhagavata Purana\", adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedanta philosophy. The \"Bhagavata Purana\" is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE.\n\nIn the ancient and medieval literature of Shaivism, called the \"Āgamas\", the influence of Advaita Vedanta is once again prominent. Of the 92 \"Āgamas\", ten are \"Dvaita\" texts, eighteen are \"Bhedabheda\", and sixty-four are \"Advaita\" texts. According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada's Advaita Vedanta ideas and Kashmir Shaivism.\n\nShaktism, the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Vedanta and dualism premises of Samkhya–Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as \"Shaktadavaitavada\" (literally, the path of nondualistic \"Shakti\").\n\nOther influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the \"Yoga Yajnavalkya\", \"Yoga Vashishta\", \"Avadhuta Gita\", \"Markandeya Purana\" and \"Sannyasa Upanishads\" predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism share similarities and have differences, their relationship a subject of dispute among scholars. The similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention, and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, while others deny such influences, or see them as variant expressions. According to Daniel Ingalls, the Japanese Buddhist scholarship has argued that Adi Shankara did not understand Buddhism.\n\nSome Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its \"Maya\" and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism. Ramanuja, the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a \"Prachanna Bauddha\", that is, a \"crypto-Buddhist\", and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda Vedanta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.\n\nA few Buddhist scholars made the opposite criticism in the medieval era toward their Buddhist opponents. In the sixth century CE, for example, the Mahayana Buddhist scholar Bhaviveka redefined Vedantic concepts to show how they fit into Madhyamaka concepts, and \"equate[d] the Buddha's Dharma body with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the Upanishads.\" In his \"Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ\", Bhaviveka stages a Hinayana (Theravada) interlocutor, who accuses Mahayana Buddhists of being \"crypto-Vedantins\". Medieval era Tibetan Gelugpa scholars accused the Jonang school of being \"crypto-Vedantist.\" Contemporary scholar David Kalupahana called the seventh century Buddhist scholar Chandrakirti a \"crypto-Vedantist\", a view rejected by scholars of Madhayamika Buddhism.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta tradition has historically rejected accusations of crypto-Buddhism highlighting their respective views on \"Atman\", \"Anatta\" and \"Brahman\".\n\nAccording to scholars, the influence of Mahayana Buddhism on Advaita Vedanta has been significant. Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism. According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, \"a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw.\"\n\nBoth traditions hold that \"the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances\", and both admit \"degrees of truth or existence\". Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions. Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated \"into his own system a Buddhist notion of \"maya\" which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads\". Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's Vijnanavada and Shankara's Advaita.\n\nAccording to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.\n\nDasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent \"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\" The influence of Mahayana Buddhism on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the Visuddhimagga of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains \"some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins\". According to John Plott,\nThe influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question.\n\nOne school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (\"vijñapti-mātra\") and \"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā\".\n\nOf particular interest is Chapter Four of Gaudapada's text \"Karika\", in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the Buddha and the term \"Asparsayoga\" is borrowed from Buddhism. According to Murti, \"the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an Advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them.\" However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. According to Sarma, \"to mistake him [Gaudapada] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd\". The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:\n\nAdvaitins have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis. Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist. Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta holds the premise, \"Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or \"Anatta\", non-self) is self evident\".\n\nIn Buddhism, \"Anatta\" (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An-atman) is the concept that in human beings and living creatures, there is no \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhist philosophy rejects the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (\"maya\"), asserting instead the theory of \"no-self\" and \"no-soul\". Most schools of Buddhism, from its earliest days, have denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to \"nirvana\", in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nSome Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\" suggest self-like concepts, variously called \"Tathagatagarbha\" or \"Buddha nature\". These have been controversial idea in Buddhism, and \"eternal self\" concepts have been generally rejected. In modern era studies, scholars such as Wayman and Wayman state that these \"self-like\" concepts are neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality. Some scholars posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nThe epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article). However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's \"Śabda\" pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta posits a substance ontology, an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman-Brahman. In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes.\n\nIn contrast, Buddhism posits a process ontology, also called as \"event ontology\". According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process. There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena (\"pratitya samutpada\") in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Vedanta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer.\n\nThe Pali Abdhidhamma and Theravada Buddhism considered all existence as \"dhamma\", and left the ontological questions about reality and the nature of \"dhamma\" unexplained.\n\nAccording to Renard, Advaita's theory of three levels of reality is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.\n\nA central concern for Shankara, in his objections against Buddhism, is what he perceives as nihilism of the Buddhists. Shankara states that there \"must be something beyond cognition, namely a cognizer,\" which he asserts is the self-evident \"Atman\" or witness. Buddhism, according to Shankara, denies the cognizer. He also considers the notion of Brahman as pure knowledge and \"the quintessence of positive reality.\"\n\nThe teachings in Brahma Sutras, states Shankara, differ from both the Buddhist realists and the Buddhist idealists. Shankara elaborates on these arguments against various schools of Buddhism, partly presenting refutations which were already standard in his time, and partly offering his own objections. Shankara's original contribution in explaining the difference between Advaita and Buddhism was his \"argument for identity\" and the \"argument for the witness\". In Shankara's view, the Buddhist are internally inconsistent in their theories, because \"the reservoir-consciousness that [they] set up, being momentary, is no better than ordinary consciousness. Or, if [they] allow the reservoir-consciousness to be lasting, [they] destroy [their] theory of momentariness.\" In response to the idealists, he notes that their \"alaya-vijnana\", or store-house consciousness, runs counter to the Buddhist theory of momentariness. With regard to the \"Sunyavada\" (Madhyamaka), Shankara states that \"being contradictory to all valid means of knowledge, we have not thought worth while to refute\" and \"common sense (\"loka-vyavahara\") cannot be denied without the discovery of some other truth\".\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is most often regarded as an idealist monism. According to King, Advaita Vedanta developed \"to its ultimate extreme\" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads. In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedanta \"monistic,\" since this confuses the \"negation of difference\" with \"conflation into one.\" \"Advaita\" is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the \"negation of a difference,\" between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. \n\nAccording to Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories. According to Jacqueline Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes \"oneness\" premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.\n\nNicholson states Advaita Vedanta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings.\n\nBhramara-kita-nyaya is based on the analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar, which states how the caterpillar gets transformed into a wasp by intense thinking of the latter. Similarly, the Jiva becomes Brahman itself by meditating intensely on Brahman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3151382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3151382", "title": "Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge", "text": "Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge\n\nThe prehistoric monument of Stonehenge has long been studied for its possible connections with ancient astronomy. The site is aligned in the direction of the sunrise of the summer solstice and the sunset of the winter solstice. Archaeoastronomers have made a range of further claims about the site’s connection to astronomy, its meaning, and its use.\n\nStonehenge has an opening in the henge earthwork facing northeast, and suggestions that particular significance was placed by its builders on the solstice and equinox points have followed. For example, the summer solstice sun rose close to the Heel Stone, and the sun’s first rays shone into the centre of the monument between the horseshoe arrangement. While it is possible that such an alignment could be coincidental, this astronomical orientation had been acknowledged since William Stukeley drew the site and first identified its axis along the midsummer sunrise in 1720.\n\nStukeley noticed that the Heel Stone was not precisely aligned on the sunrise. The drifting of the position of the sunrise due to the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic since the monument’s erection does not account for this imprecision. Recently, evidence has been found for a neighbour to the Heel Stone, no longer extant. The second stone may have instead been one side of a ‘solar corridor’ used to frame the sunrise.\n\nStukeley and the renowned astronomer Edmund Halley attempted what amounted to the first scientific attempt to date a prehistoric monument. Stukeley concluded the Stonehenge had been set up “by the use of a magnetic compass to lay out the works, the needle varying so much, at that time, from true north.” He attempted to calculate the change in magnetic variation between the observed and theoretical (ideal) Stonehenge sunrise, which he imagined would relate to the date of construction. Their calculations returned three dates, the earliest of which, 460 BC, was accepted by Stukeley. That was incorrect, but this early exercise in dating is a landmark in field archaeology.\n\nEarly efforts to date Stonehenge exploited changes in astronomical declinations and led to efforts such as H. Broome’s 1864 theory that the monument was built in 977 BC, when the star Sirius would have risen over Stonehenge’s Avenue. Sir Norman Lockyer proposed a date of 1680 BC based entirely on an incorrect sunrise azimuth for the Avenue, aligning it on a nearby Ordnance Survey trig point, a modern feature. Petrie preferred a later date of 730 AD. The relevant stones were leaning considerably during his survey, and it was not considered accurate.\n\nAn archaeoastronomy debate was triggered by the 1963 publication of \"Stonehenge Decoded\", by Gerald Hawkins an American astronomer. Hawkins claimed to observe numerous alignments, both lunar and solar. He argued that Stonehenge could have been used to predict eclipses. Hawkins’ book received wide publicity, in part because he used a computer in his calculations, then a novelty. Archaeologists were suspicious in the face of further contributions to the debate coming from British astronomer C. A. ‘Peter’ Newham and Sir Fred Hoyle, the famous Cambridge cosmologist, as well as by Alexander Thom, a retired professor of engineering, who had been studying stone circles for more than 20 years. Their theories have faced criticism in recent decades from Richard J. C. Atkinson and others who have suggested impracticalities in the ‘Stone Age calculator’ interpretation.\n\nGerald Hawkins’ work on Stonehenge was first published in \"Nature\" in 1963 following analyses he had carried out using the Harvard-Smithsonian IBM computer. Hawkins found not one or two alignments but dozens. He had studied 165 significant features at the monument and used the computer to check every alignment between them against every rising and setting point for the sun, moon, planets, and bright stars in the positions they would have been in 1500 BCE. Thirteen solar and eleven lunar correlations were very precise in relation to the early features at the site but precision was less for later features of the monument. Hawkins also proposed a method for using the Aubrey holes to predict lunar eclipses by moving markers from hole to hole. In 1965 Hawkins and J.B. White wrote \"Stonehenge Decoded\", which detailed his findings and proposed that the monument was a ‘Neolithic computer’.\n\nAtkinson replied with his article “Moonshine on Stonehenge” in \"Antiquity\" in 1966, pointing out that some of the pits which Hawkins had used for his sight lines were more likely to have been natural depressions, and that he had allowed a margin of error of up to 2 degrees in his alignments. Atkinson found that the probability of so many alignments being visible from 165 points to be close to 0.5 (or rather 50:50) rather that the “one in a million” possibility which Hawkins had claimed. That the Station Stones stood on top of the earlier Aubrey Holes meant that many of Hawkins’ alignments between the two features were illusory. The same article by Atkinson contains further criticisms of the interpretation of Aubrey Holes as astronomical markers, and of Fred Hoyle’s work.\n\nA question exists over whether the English climate would have permitted accurate observation of astronomical events. Modern researchers were looking for alignments with phenomena they already knew existed; the prehistoric users of the site did not have this advantage.\n\nIn 1966, C. A. ‘Peter’ Newham described an alignment for the equinoxes by drawing a line between one of the Station Stones with a posthole next to the Heel Stone. He also identified a lunar alignment; the long sides of the rectangle created by the four station stones matched the moon rise and moonset at the major standstill. Newham also suggested that the postholes near the entrance were used for observing the saros cycle.\n\nTwo of the Station Stones are damaged and although their positions would create an approximate rectangle, their date and thus their relationship with the other features at the site is uncertain. Stonehenge’s latitude ( 51° 10′ 44″ N ) is unusual in that only at this approximate latitude (within about 50 km) do the lunar and solar alignments mentioned above occur at right angles to one another. More than 50 km north or south of the latitude of Stonehenge, the station stones could not be set out as a rectangle.\n\nAlexander Thom had been examining stone circles since the 1950s in search of astronomical alignments and the megalithic yard. It was not until 1973 that he turned his attention to Stonehenge. Thom chose to ignore alignments between features within the monument, considering them to be too close together to be reliable. He looked for landscape features that could have marked lunar and solar events. However, one of Thom’s key sites – Peter’s Mound – turned out to be a twentieth-century rubbish dump.\n\nAlthough Stonehenge has become an increasingly popular destination during the summer solstice, with 20,000 people visiting in 2005, scholars have developed growing evidence that indicates prehistoric people visited the site only during the winter solstice. The only megalithic monuments in the British Isles to contain a clear, compelling solar alignment are Newgrange and Maeshowe, which both famously face the winter solstice sunrise.\n\nThe most recent evidence supporting the theory of winter visits includes bones and teeth from pigs which were slaughtered at nearby Durrington Walls. Their age at death indicating that they were slaughtered either in December or January every year. Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield has said, “We have no evidence that anyone was in the landscape in summer.”\n\n\n"}

However, the intersection of infinitely many infinite arithmetic progressions might be a single number rather than itself being an infinite progression.\n\nIf\n\nthen \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1343423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343423", "title": "Collective security", "text": "Collective security\n\nCollective security can be understood as a security arrangement, political, regional, or global, in which each state in the system accepts that the security of one is the concern of all, and therefore commits to a collective response to threats to, and breaches to peace. Collective security is more ambitious than systems of alliance security or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally, and to address a wide range of possible threats. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic. Several prerequisites have to be met for it to have a chance of working. It is the theory or practice of states pledging to defend one another in order to deter aggression or to exterminate transgressor if international order has been breached.\n\nCollective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for power management on an international scale. Cardinal Richelieu proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe.\n\nThe concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in Immanuel Kant's \"\". Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states. However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a global government but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.\n\nInternational co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the \"status quo\" between European states and so avoid war. This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n\nThe forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Frédéric Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European Great Powers. It was these alliances that came into effect at the start of the First World War in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between industrialized countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of industrialization (for example mass production) had been dedicated to war. The result of this industrial warfare was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of armed services dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths.\n\nBy the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent. Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"the war to end all wars\", and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.\n\nCollective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. This contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites have to be met for it to work.\n\nCollective Security also contrasts with alliances in term of different forms. In Ph.D dissertation of Andreatta, collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any one rather than on unilateral idea of some against specific others. Alliance has the form of two groups against each other as like states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security system takes form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any one of them. Moreover, it is also different from alliance since collective security is built to focus on internal regulation required universal membership while alliance is built to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. For alliance, states would see their allies as absolute gain and their enemies as relative gains without legal obligation. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality as the whole group would be required to punish the aggressor with the hope for it not to violate general norms, in which are beyond the states' control rather than by their self-interests. Opposite with short term interest of allies fighting for a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for global peace. \n\nSovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo, willingly cooperate, accepting a degree of vulnerability and in some cases of minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. Collective Security is achieved by setting up an international cooperative organisation, under the auspices of international law and this gives rise to a form of international collective governance, albeit limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, balance of power and exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the Collective Security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible and needing remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security, but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without the need of joining the camp of the nations balancing their neighbours.\n\nThe concept of \"collective security\" forwarded by men such as Michael Joseph Savage, Martin Wight, Immanuel Kant, and Woodrow Wilson, are deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner, to \"avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out.\" The term \"collective security\" has also been cited as a principle of the United Nations, and the League of Nations before that. By employing a system of collective security, the UN hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace, thereby avoiding any conflict.\n\nCollective security selectively incorporates the concept of both balance of power and global government. However, the term \"Collective Security\" is not the same as Balance of power, mentioned in Realism theory. According to Adreatta, balance of power focuses on state's unilateral interests stoping aggression. Since states look at the world as having security dilemma due to the fear of relative gain, state does not want any state to become predominant causing a mutually restraining equilibrium. In other word, Balance of power between states opts for decentralization of power. States are separate actors who do not subordinate their autonomy or sovereignty to a central. \"Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern.\" The expectation of order and peace comes from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby cancel each other out to produce “deterrence through equilibration.” In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in Balance of Power theories. Balance of power fails to maintain stability led to break down of war as in the case of Napoleonic Wars and World Wars when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight. \n\nAt the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well established sovereign nation state. This concept strips states of their \"standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned,\" and superimposing on them \"an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community.\" Despite some different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective Collective security selectively incorporates both of the concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can broil down to a phrase: \"order without government.\" Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under anarchy. \n\nOrganski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:\n\n\nMorgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war:\n\n\nAfter World War I, the first large scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the League of Nations in 1919–20. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decision-making and for collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of United States in joining League of Nations and the rise of USSR outside the League as one of major reasons why it was failed under enforcement of collective security. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations' collective security is the Manchurian Crisis, when Japan occupied part of China (which was a League member). After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution calling for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Given that every nation on the League of Nations council had veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the LN's ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing the League's members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League.\n\nA similar process occurred in 1935, when Italy invaded Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Sanctions were passed, but Italy would have vetoed any stronger resolution. Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's government as a potential deterrent to Hitler, given that Mussolini was not yet in what would become the Axis alliance of World War II. Thus, neither enforced any serious sanctions against the Italian government. Additionally, in this case and with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the absence of the United States from the League of Nations deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues (most leading members were European), and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but in its covenantors' commitment to honor its tenets.\n\nOne active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate pre-war years was the Soviet foreign minister, Maxim Litvinov. However, there are grounds for doubt about the depth of Soviet commitment to the principle as well as that of Western powers. After the Munich Agreement in September 1938 and the passivity of outside powers in the face of German occupation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, it was shown that the Western powers were not prepared to engage in collective security against aggression by the Axis powers together with the Soviet Union, Soviet foreign policy was revised and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany, signed by Litvinov's successor, Vyacheslav Molotov, on August 23 of that year. The war in Europe broke out a week later, with the invasion of Poland, starting on September 1, 1939. Thus, this could be seen that collective security does not always work due to the lack of commitment and unwillingness of states or International Community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).\n\nThe 1945 United Nations Charter, although containing stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, does not represent a complete system of collective security, but rather a balance between collective action on the one hand and continued operation of the states system (including the continued special roles of great powers) on the other. States in UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts based on their self-interests. United Nations can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council due to their Veto power and excessive assistance or aid. This has made those states to act unilaterally ignoring the approval, or flout orders of Security Council not to act unilaterally. The Iraq crisis is a clearer example as “Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme.” (Eke, 2007) In addition, lack of geographical spread of members in Security Council causes unbalancing on the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be only heard, but not all policies were adopted in response to them unless they serves the great powers' interests. \n\nHowever, this does not mean collective security in the UN is completely fail. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving, given the rise of internal state conflicts. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of these have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The remainder have either been internal civil wars or civil wars where other nations intervened in some manner. This means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether this will involve more powerful peacekeeping forces, or a larger role for the UN diplomatically, will likely be judged on a case-by-case basis. \n\nCollective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. NATO is the best known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked after the September 11 attacks on the United States, after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US War on Terror in Afghanistan.\n\nCollective defense has its roots in multiparty alliances and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state's cost of providing fully for its security. Smaller members of NATO, for example, have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on non-military priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense, if needed.\n\nOn the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In World War I, countries in the collective defense arrangement known as the Triple Entente (France, Britain, Russia) were pulled into war quickly when Russia started full mobilization against Austria-Hungary, whose ally Germany subsequently declared war on Russia.\n\n\n\n"}

The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of Kermack and McKendrick in 1927.\n\nThe models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyse.\n\nCompartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.\n\nThe SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments– S for the number susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number recovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella.\nThese variables (S, I, and R) represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of \"t\" (time): S(\"t\"), I(\"t\") and R(\"t\"). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.\n\nAs implied by the variable function of \"t\", the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an endemic disease with a short infectious period, such as measles in the UK prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(\"t\")) over time. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.\n\nEach member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. This can be shown as a flow diagram in which the boxes represent the different compartments and the arrows the transition between compartments, i.e.\n\nFor the full specification of the model, the arrows should be labeled with the transition rates between compartments. Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.\n\nBetween I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or death). If the duration of the infection is denoted \"D\", then γ = 1/\"D\", since an individual experiences one recovery in \"D\" units of time.\n\nIt's assumed that the permanence of each single subject in the epidemic states is a random variable with exponential distribution. More complex and realistic distributions (such as Erlang distribution) can be equally used with few modifications.\n\nThe dynamics of an epidemic, for example the flu, are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models. The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary differential equations:\n\nThis model was for the first time proposed by O. Kermack and Anderson Gray McKendrick as a special case of what we now call Kermack-McKendrick theory, and followed work McKendrick had done with Ronald Ross.\n\nThis system is non-linear, and does not admit a generic analytic solution. Nevertheless, significant results can be derived analytically, and with Monte Carlo methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm.\n\nFirstly note that from:\n\nit follows that:\n\nexpressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population formula_6. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.\n\nSecondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:\nthe so-called basic reproduction number (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible. This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is formula_8, and the typical time until recovery is formula_9. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others \"before\" the infected has recovered is: formula_10\n\nBy dividing the first differential equation by the third, separating the variables and integrating we get\n(where formula_12 and formula_13 are the initial numbers of, respectively, susceptible and removed subjects). Thus, in the limit formula_14, the proportion of recovered individuals obeys the following transcendental equation\nThis equation shows that at the end of an epidemic, unless formula_16, not all individuals of the population have recovered, so some must remain susceptible. This means that the end of an epidemic is caused by the decline in the number of infected individuals rather than an absolute lack of susceptible subjects.\nThe role of the basic reproduction number is extremely important. In fact, upon rewriting the equation for infectious individuals as follows:\nit yields that if:\nthen:\ni.e., there will be a proper epidemic outbreak with an increase of the number of the infectious (which can reach a considerable fraction of the population). On the contrary, if\nthen\ni.e., independently from the initial size of the susceptible population the disease can never cause a proper epidemic outbreak. As a consequence, it is clear that the basic reproduction number is extremely important.\n\nNote that in the above model the function:\n\nmodels the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population formula_23):\n\nCapasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.\n\nIn 2014, Harko T. et al. derived an exact analytical solution to the SIR model. In the without vital dynamics setup, for formula_25, etc., it corresponds to the following time parametrization\n\nfor formula_29, formula_30, with initial conditions formula_31 formula_32 satisfies formula_33. By the transcendental equation for formula_34 above, it follows that formula_35, if formula_36 and formula_37.\n\nAn equivalent analytical solution was found by Miller yields\n\nHere formula_42 can be interpreted as the expected number of transmissions an individual has received by time formula_43. The two solutions are related by formula_44.\n\nEffectively the same result can be found in the original work by Kermack and McKendrick .\nConsidering a population characterized by a death rate formula_45 and birth rate formula_46, and where a communicable disease is spreading. The model with mass-action transmission is:\n\nfor which the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is:\n\nIn this case, we can derive a basic reproduction number :\nwhich has threshold properties. In fact, independently from biologically meaningful initial values, one can show that:\n\nThe point EE is called the Endemic Equilibrium. With heuristic arguments, one may show that formula_54 may be read as the average number of infections caused by a single infectious subject in a wholly susceptible population, the above relationship biologically means that if this number is less or equal than one the disease goes extinct, whereas if this number is greater than one the disease will remain permanently endemic in the population.\n\nSome infections, for example those from the common cold and influenza, do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, and individuals become susceptible again.\n\nWe have the model:\n\nNote that denoting with N the total population it holds that:\nformula_57\nit follows that:\ni.e. the dynamics of infectious is ruled by a logistic equation, so that formula_59:\n\nFortunately, it is possible to find an analytical solution to this model (by making a transformation of variables: formula_62 and substituting this into the mean-field equations), such that the basic reproduction rate is greater than unity. The solution is given as\nwhere formula_64 is the endemic infected population, formula_65, and formula_66. As the system is assumed to be closed, the susceptible population is then formula_67.\n\nFor many infections, including measles, babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies (passed across the placenta and additionally through colostrum). This is called passive immunity. This added detail can be shown by including an M class (for maternally derived immunity) at the beginning of the model\n\nTo indicate this mathematically, an additional compartment is added, M(t), which results in the following differential equations:\n\nSome people who have had an infectious disease such as tuberculosis never completely recover and continue to carry the infection, whilst not suffering the disease themselves. They may then move back into the infectious compartment and suffer symptoms (as in tuberculosis) or they may continue to infect others in their carrier state, while not suffering symptoms. The most famous example of this is probably Mary Mallon, who infected 22 people with typhoid fever. The carrier compartment is labelled C.\n\nFor many important infections there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed).\n\nAssuming that the incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with\nparameter a (i.e. the average incubation period is formula_72), and also assuming the presence of vital dynamics with birth rate equal to death rate, we have the model:\n\nWe have formula_77, but this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal; in general formula_23 is a variable.\n\nFor this model, the basic reproduction number is:\n\nformula_79\n\nSimilarly to the SIR model, also in this case we have a Disease-Free-Equilibrium (N,0,0,0) and an Endemic Equilibrium EE, and one can show that, independently form biologically meaningful initial conditions\n\nit holds that:\n\nIn case of periodically varying contact rate formula_83 the condition for the global attractiveness of DFE is that the following linear system with periodic coefficients:\n\nis stable (i.e. it has its Floquet's eigenvalues inside the unit circle in the complex plane).\n\nThe SEIS model takes into consideration the exposed or latent period of the disease, giving an additional compartment, E(t).\nIn this model an infection does not leave any immunity thus individuals that have recovered return to being susceptible again, moving back into the \"S\"(\"t\") compartment. The following differential equations describe this model:\n\nFor the case of a disease, with the factors of passive immunity, and a latency period there is the MSEIR model.\n\nAn MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.\n\nIt is well known that the probability of getting a disease is not constant in the time. Some diseases are seasonal, such as the common cold viruses, which are more prevalent during winter. With childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, there is a strong correlation with the school calendar, so that during the school holidays the probability of getting such a disease dramatically decreases.\n\nAs a consequence, for many classes of diseases one should consider a force of infection with periodically ('seasonal') varying contact rate\nwith period T equal to one year.\n\nThus, our model becomes\n\n(the dynamics of recovered easily follows from formula_100), i.e. a nonlinear set of differential equations with periodically varying parameters. It is well known that this class of dynamical systems may undergo very interesting and complex phenomena of nonlinear parametric resonance. It is easy to see that if:\n\nwhereas if the integral is greater than one the disease will not die out and there may be such resonances. For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.\nThis allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the pseudo-period of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.\nRemarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.\n\nThe SIR model can be modified to model vaccination. Typically these introduce an additional compartment to the SIR model, formula_102, for vaccinated individuals. Below are some examples.\n\nIn presence of a communicable diseases, one of main tasks is that of eradicating it via prevention measures and, if possible, via the establishment of a mass vaccination program. Let us consider a disease for which the newborn are vaccinated (with a vaccine giving lifelong immunity) at a rate formula_103:\n\nwhere formula_102 is the class of vaccinated subjects. It is immediate to show that:\n\nthus we shall deal with the long term behavior of formula_109 and formula_110, for which it holds that:\n\nIn other words, if\nthe vaccination program is not successful in eradicating the disease, on the contrary it will remain endemic, although at lower levels than the case of absence of vaccinations. This means that the mathematical model suggests that for a disease whose basic reproduction number may be as high as 18 one should have to vaccinate 94.4% of newborns in order to eradicate the disease.\n\nModern societies are facing the challenge of \"rational\" exemption, i.e. the family's decision to not vaccinate children as a consequence of a \"rational\" comparison between the perceived risk from infection and that from getting damages from the vaccine. In order to assess whether this behavior is really rational, i.e. if it can equally lead to the eradication of the disease, one may simply assume that the vaccination rate is an increasing function of the number of infectious subjects:\nIn such a case the eradication condition becomes:\ni.e. the baseline vaccination rate should be greater than the \"mandatory vaccination\" threshold, which, in case of exemption, cannot hold. Thus, \"rational\" exemption might be myopic since it is based only on the current low incidence due to high vaccine coverage, instead taking into account future resurgence of infection due to coverage decline.\n\nIn case there also are vaccinations of non newborn at a rate ρ the equation for the susceptible and vaccinated subject has to be modified as follows:\n\nleading to the following eradication condition:\n\nThis strategy repeatedly vaccinates a defined age-cohort (such as young children or the elderly) in a susceptible population over time. Using this strategy, the block of susceptible individuals is then immediately removed, making it possible to eliminate an infectious disease, (such as measles), from the entire population. Every T time units a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects is vaccinated in a relatively short (with respect to the dynamics of the disease) time. This leads to the following impulsive differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects:\n\nIt is easy to see that by setting one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:\n\nand that the eradication condition is:\n\nAge has a deep influence on the disease spread rate in a population, especially the contact rate. This rate summarizes the effectiveness of contacts between susceptible and infectious subjects. Taking into account the ages of the epidemic classes formula_123 (to limit ourselves to the susceptible-infectious-removed scheme) such that:\n\n(where formula_127 is the maximum admissible age)and their dynamics is not described, as one might think, by \"simple\" partial differential equations, but by integro-differential equations:\n\nwhere:\n\nis the force of infection, which, of course, will depend, though the contact kernel formula_132 on the interactions between the ages.\n\nComplexity is added by the initial conditions for newborns (i.e. for a=0), that are straightforward for infectious and removed:\n\nbut that are nonlocal for the density of susceptible newborns:\n\nwhere formula_135 are the fertilities of the adults.\n\nMoreover, defining now the density of the total population formula_136 one obtains:\n\nIn the simplest case of equal fertilities in the three epidemic classes, we have that in oder to have demographic equilibrium the following necessary and sufficient condition linking the fertility formula_138 with the mortality formula_139 must hold:\n\nand the demographic equilibrium is\n\nautomatically ensuring the existence of the disease-free solution:\n\nA basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of an appropriate functional operator.\n\nIn the case of some diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B, it is possible for the offspring of infected parents to be born infected. This transmission of the disease down from the mother is called Vertical Transmission. The influx of additional members into the infected category can be considered within the model by including a fraction of the newborn members in the infected compartment.\n\nDiseases transmitted from human to human indirectly, i.e. malaria spread by way of mosquitoes, are transmitted through a vector. In these cases, the infection transfers from human to insect and an epidemic model must include both species, generally requiring many more compartments than a model for direct transmission. For more information on this type of model see the reference \"Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases: Theory and Applications\", by R. M. Anderson.\n\nOther occurrences which may need to be considered when modeling an epidemic include things such as the following:\n\nIt is important to stress that the deterministic models presented here are valid only in case of sufficiently large populations, and as such should be used cautiously.\n\nTo be more precise, these models are only valid in the thermodynamic limit, where the population is effectively infinite. In stochastic models, the long-time endemic equilibrium derived above, does not hold, as there is a finite probability that the number of infected individuals drops below one in a system. In a true system then, the pathogen may not propagate, as no host will be infected. But, in deterministic mean-field models, the number of infecteds can take on real, namely, non-integer values of infected hosts, and the pathogen may still persist in the system with a finite number of infected hosts, less than one but greater than zero.\n\n\n\n"}

Composition relates to narrative works of literature, but also relates to essays, biographies, and other works established in the field of rhetoric.\nIn narratives (primarily fiction), composition includes, but is not limited to,\n\n\nIn rhetoric (primarily non-fiction), composition is the arrangement and strategic use of written, oral, visual and/or digital in order to inform, persuade, or motivate an audience in a given situation.\n\nTraditionally, oratory, or classical rhetoric, is composed of five stages, or canons:\nTypically, in any speech classroom, these stages are still prevalent in the composing process. Other such qualities to be included, especially when considering ones' audience and methods of persuasion, would be the rhetorical appeals:\n\nAs oral discourse shifted to more written discourse, the stage of memory and delivery began to fade, yet the first three stages hold its rank in the writing process of most composition classrooms. The rhetorical appeals also prove important in written texts, as the strategies of using these appeals become more complex as writers understand their audience's needs when not in physical view.\n\nComposition, which includes the language of visuals is a recent development in composition studies. Sonja K. Foss argues that visuals are a valued component of rhetorical study, and to only focus on verbal discourse, limits the opportunity to engage in multiple symbols that create meaning and speak rhetorically. In thinking about how visuals are used to communicate, and how they are composed or analyzed in a rhetorical work, she argues that one considers the focus:\nFoss, who acknowledges visual rhetoric, demonstrates that composition studies has to consider other definitions and incorporations of language.\n\nThis composition refers to work produced in digital spaces. The writer or speaker must not only consider all the composing processes of the above-mentioned discourse (like purpose, arrangement, etc.), but the relationship medium plays in the composing and decision process of that work. In digital discourse, the fifth canon of delivery takes on new meaning, and digital spaces change how traditional views of authority, circulation, and context are understood, like composing in a Wikipedia. Thus digital rhetoric, or eRhetoric offers new ways of composing.\n\n"}

What I mean by \"everything that can be removed from the predicate\" is best explained by giving an example of something not so removable.\n\nBut first take something removable. \"Cain kills Abel.\" Here the predicate appears as \"— kills —.\" But we can remove killing from the predicate and make the latter \"— stands in the relation — to —.\" Suppose we attempt to remove more from the predicate and put the last into the form \"— exercises the function of relate of the relation — to —\" and then putting \"the function of relate to the relation\" into another subject leave as predicate \"— exercises — in respect to — to —.\" But this \"exercises\" expresses \"exercises the function\". Nay more, it expresses \"exercises the function of relate\", so that we find that though we may put this into a separate subject, it continues in the predicate just the same.\n\nStating this in another form, to say that \"A is in the relation R to B\" is to say that A is in a certain relation to R. Let us separate this out thus: \"A is in the relation R¹ (where R¹ is the relation of a relate to the relation of which it is the relate) to R to B\". But A is here said to be in a certain relation to the relation R¹. So that we can express the same fact by saying, \"A is in the relation R¹ to the relation R¹ to the relation R to B\", and so on \"ad infinitum\".\n\nA predicate which can thus be analyzed into parts all homogeneous with the whole I call a \"continuous predicate\". It is very important in logical analysis, because a continuous predicate obviously cannot be a \"compound\" except of continuous predicates, and thus when we have carried analysis so far as to leave only a continuous predicate, we have carried it to its ultimate elements. (C.S. Peirce, \"Letters to Lady Welby\" (14 December 1908), \"Selected Writings\", pp. 396–397).\n\n"}

These are:\n\nThese exact words were first used in the English Bill of Rights 1689. They were later also adopted in the United States by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution (ratified 1791) and in the British Leeward Islands (1798). Very similar words, \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\", appear in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948. The right under a different formulation is also found in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) also contains this fundamental right in section 12 and it is to be found in Article 4 (quoting the European Convention verbatim) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000). It is also found in Article 16 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984), and in Article 40 of the Constitution of Poland (1997). The Constitution of the Marshall Islands, in the sixth section of its Bill of Rights (Article 2), prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishment\", which it defines as: the death penalty; torture; \"inhuman and degrading treatment\"; and \"excessive fines or deprivations\".\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \"cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted.\" The general principles the United States Supreme Court relied on to decide whether or not a particular punishment was cruel and unusual were determined by Justice William Brennan. In \"Furman v. Georgia\", , Justice Brennan wrote, \"There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide means by which a court can determine whether a challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is \"cruel and unusual.\" The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes.\"\n\nContinuing, he wrote that he expected that no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a \"cumulative\" analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way the United States Supreme Court \"set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [,if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty.\"\n\nThere is great discussion as to whether capital punishment is cruel and unusual. Common arguments are that capital punishment is more expensive when factoring in appeals versus life in prison, and that the government has been wrong before on death penalty cases (therefore, the government could be wrong again, and the government ought not have the authority to end a life). These two arguments alone may or may not qualify under the tests the government puts forth, which could also be considered arbitrary itself, especially if society is not informed enough on these considerable facts. For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often deliberately cruel and painful. Severe historical execution methods include the breaking wheel, hanged, drawn and quartered, mazzatello, boiling to death, death by burning, execution by drowning, death by starvation, immurement, flaying, disembowelment, crucifixion, impalement, crushing, execution by elephant, keelhauling, stoning, dismemberment, sawing, scaphism, slow slicing, blood eagle, bamboo torture and necklacing.\n\nIn 2008, Michael Portillo on the show \"Horizon\" argued that in ensuring an execution is not of a cruel and unusual nature, the following criteria must be met:\n\nThe show argued that hypoxia appears to meet the criteria, by way of applying a combination of the gases argon and nitrogen, as the person being executed would not feel any physical pain but would experience a euphoric state. It was further argued that these gases could be applied cheaply and efficiently by restraining the prisoner by way of physical restraints and mask.\n\n"}
{"id": "13775689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13775689", "title": "Cultural emphasis", "text": "Cultural emphasis\n\nCultural emphasis is an important aspect of a culture which is often reflected though language and, more specifically, vocabulary (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 266). This means that the vocabulary people use in a culture indicates what is important to that group of people. If there are a lot of words to describe a certain topic in a specific culture, then there is a good chance that that topic is considered important to that culture.\n\nThe idea of cultural emphasis is rooted form the work of Franz Boas, who is considered to be one of the founders of American Anthropology (Ottenheimer, 2006, p. 15). Franz Boas developed and taught concepts such as cultural relativism and the \"cultural unconscious\", which allowed anthropologists who studied under him, like Edward Sapir and Ruth Benedict, to further study and develop ideas on language and culture (Hart, 2005, p. 179).\n\nOne way in which cultural emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather. For example, in a place where it is cold and it snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.\n\nIn a place where it is hot, a cornucopia of associated terms would be expected.\n\nA concentration of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them. Furthermore, if you are not from the area, or that culture, you might not have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "456252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=456252", "title": "David Duke", "text": "David Duke\n\nDavid Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is an American white supremacist, white nationalist politician, white separatist, antisemitic conspiracy theorist, Holocaust denier, convicted felon, and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nA former Republican Louisiana State Representative, Duke was a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries in 1988 and the Republican presidential primaries in 1992. Duke also ran unsuccessfully for the Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, and for Governor of Louisiana.\n\nIn 2002, Duke pled guilty to felony fraud. Specifically, he defrauded his political supporters by pretending to be in dire financial straits, and asking them for money to help him pay for basic necessities. At the time, Duke was financially secure, and he used his supporters' money for recreational gambling. He subsequently served a 15-month sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring in Texas.\n\nDuke speaks against what he alleges as Jewish control of the Federal Reserve Bank, the U.S. federal government, and the media. Duke supports the preservation of what he considers to be Western culture and traditionalist Christian family values, as well as abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, voluntary racial segregation, anti-communism, and white separatism.\n\nDuke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Alice Maxine (Crick) and David Hedger Duke. As the son of an engineer for Shell Oil Company, Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. They lived a short time in the Netherlands before settling in Louisiana. In the late 1960s, Duke met William Luther Pierce, the leader of the white nationalist, neo-Nazi, Holocaust denial and antisemitic National Alliance, who would remain a lifelong influence on him. Duke joined the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in 1967.\n\nIn 1968, Duke enrolled at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, and in 1970, he formed a white student group called the \"White Youth Alliance\" that was affiliated with the National Socialist White People's Party. The same year, to protest lawyer William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University in New Orleans, Duke appeared at a demonstration in Nazi uniform. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of Hitler's birth, he became known on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform.\n\nDuke says that he spent nine months in Laos, calling it a \"normal tour of duty.\" He actually went to Laos in order to join his father, who was working there and had asked him to visit during the summer of 1971. His father helped him gain a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a Molotov cocktail on the blackboard. He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines 20 times at night to drop rice to anti-communist insurgents in planes flying off the ground, narrowly avoiding receiving a shrapnel wound. Two Air America pilots who were in Laos at that time said that the planes only flew during the day and that they also flew no less than from the ground. One pilot suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe \"milk run\" once or twice but no more than that. Duke was also unable to recall the name of the airfield that he had used.\n\nDuke graduated from LSU in 1974. Shortly after graduation, Duke founded the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKKK).\n\nIn January 1972, Duke was arrested in New Orleans for \"inciting a riot\". Several racial confrontations broke out that month in the Crescent City, including one at the Robert E. Lee Monument involving Duke, Addison Roswell Thompson—a perennial segregationist candidate for governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans—and his 89-year-old friend and mentor, Rene LaCoste (not to be confused with the French tennis player René Lacoste). Thompson and LaCoste dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a Confederate flag at the monument. The Black Panthers began throwing bricks at the pair, but police arrived in time to prevent serious injury.\n\nDuke first ran for the Louisiana Senate as a Democrat from a Baton Rouge district in 1975. During his campaign, he was allowed to speak on the college campuses of Vanderbilt University, Indiana University, the University of Southern California, Stanford University, and Tulane University. He received 11,079 votes, one-third of those cast.\n\nIn October 1979, he ran as a Democrat for the 10th District Senate seat and finished second in a three-candidate race with 9,897 votes (26%).\n\nIn the late 1970s, Duke was accused by several Klan officials of stealing the organization's money. \"Duke is nothing but a con artist\", Jack Gregory, Duke's Florida state leader, told the \"Clearwater Sun\" after Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in Metairie. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan.\n\nIn 1979, after his first, abortive run for president (as a Democrat) and a series of highly publicized violent Klan incidents, Duke quietly incorporated the nonprofit National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP) in an attempt to leave the baggage of the Klan behind.\n\nDuke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the Georgia Forsyth County Defense League without permission. League officials described it as a fundraising scam.\n\nIn 1988, Duke ran initially in the Democratic presidential primaries. His campaign had limited impact, with the only exception—winning the little-known New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary. Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then sought and gained the Presidential nomination of the Populist Party. He appeared on the ballot for president in 11 states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of Arkansas for vice president, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker, a physician from New Mexico, for vice president. He received just 47,047 votes, for 0.04% of the national popular vote.\n\nIn December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.\n\nIn 1988, Republican State Representative Charles Cusimano of Metairie resigned his District 81 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a special election was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans John Spier Treen, a brother of former Governor David C. Treen; Delton Charles, a school board member; and Roger F. Villere, Jr., who operates Villere's Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%). As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a runoff election was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. Treen's candidacy was endorsed by U.S. President George H. W. Bush, former President Ronald Reagan, and other notable Republicans, as well as Democrats Victor Bussie (president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO) and Edward J. Steimel (president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and former director of the \"good government\" think tank, the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke, however, hammered Treen on a statement the latter had made indicating a willingness to entertain higher property taxes, anathema in that suburban district. Duke, with 8,459 votes (50.7%), defeated Treen, who polled 8,232 votes (49.3%). He served in the House from 1989 until 1992.\n\nFreshman legislator Odon Bacqué of Lafayette, a No Party member of the House, stood alone in 1989 when he attempted to deny seating to Duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election. When Treen failed in a court challenge in regard to Duke's residency, Duke was seated. Lawmakers who opposed Duke said that they had to defer to his constituents, who narrowly chose Duke as representative.\n\nDuke took his seat on the same day as Jerry Luke LeBlanc of Lafayette Parish (who won another special election, held on the same day as the Duke-Treen runoff, to choose a successor to Kathleen Blanco), the future governor who was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.\n\nColleague Ron Gomez of Lafayette stated that Duke, as a short-term legislator, was \"so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking.\"\n\nOne legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that welfare recipients be tested for the use of narcotics. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal.\n\nGomez, a longtime journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke in the mid-1970s when Duke was a state senate candidate:He was still in his mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.\n\nGomez, in his 2000 autobiography, wrote about Duke:He once presented a bill on the floor, one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times. Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.\n\nGomez added that Duke's \"tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome.\"\n\nGomez continued: [Duke's] new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of \"European-Americans.\" He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the \"growing underclass.\" He used the tried and true demagoguery of class envy to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, affirmative action... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject near and dear to every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the homestead exemption.Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the Republican organization.\n\nDuke has often criticized federal policies that he believes discriminate against white people in favor of racial minorities. To that end he formed the controversial group the National Association for the Advancement of White People, a play on the African American civil rights group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nThough Duke had first hesitated about entering the Senate race, he made his announcement of candidacy for the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 6, 1990. Duke was the only Republican in competition against three Democrats, including incumbent U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport, whom Duke derided as \"J. Benedict Johnston\".\n\nFormer Governor David Treen, whose brother, John Treen, Duke had defeated for state representative in 1989, called Duke's senatorial platform \"garbage. ... I think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of Nazism and racial superiority.\"\n\nThe Republican Party officially endorsed state Senator Ben Bagert of New Orleans in a state convention on January 13, 1990, but national GOP officials in October, just days before the primary election, concluded that Bagert could not win. To avoid a runoff between Duke and Bagert, the GOP decided to surrender the primary to Johnston. Funding for Bagert's campaign was halted, and after initial protest, Bagert dropped out two days before the election. With such a late withdrawal, Bagert's name remained on the ballot, but his votes, most of which were presumably cast as absentee ballots, were not counted. Duke received 43.51 percent (607,391 votes) of the primary vote to Johnston's 53.93 percent (752,902 votes).\n\nDuke's views prompted some of his critics, including Republicans such as journalist Quin Hillyer, to form the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which directed media attention to Duke's statements of hostility to blacks and Jews.\n\nIn a 2006 \"Financial Times\" editorial, Gideon Rachman recalled interviewing Duke's 1990 campaign manager, who said, \"The Jews just aren't a big issue in Louisiana. We keep telling David, stick to attacking the blacks. There's no point in going after the Jews, you just piss them off and nobody here cares about them anyway.\"\n\nDespite repudiation by the Republican Party, Duke ran for governor of Louisiana in 1991. In the primary, Duke finished second to former governor Edwin W. Edwards in votes; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32% of the vote. Incumbent Governor Buddy Roemer, who had switched from the Democratic to Republican parties during his term, came in third with 27% of the vote. Duke effectively killed Roemer's bid for re-election. While Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a \"protest vote\" to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana's establishment politicians. In response to criticism for his past white supremacist activities, Duke's stock response was to apologize for his past and declare that he was a born-again Christian. During the campaign, Duke said he was the spokesman for the \"white majority\" and, according to \"The New York Times\", \"equated the extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany with affirmative action programs in the United States.\"\n\nThe Christian Coalition of America, which exerted considerable impact on the Republican State Central Committee, was led in Louisiana by its national director and vice president, Billy McCormack, then the pastor of University Worship Center in Shreveport. The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. By the time of the 1991 gubernatorial election, however, its leadership had withdrawn support from Duke. Despite Duke's status as the only Republican in the runoff, incumbent President George H. W. Bush (a Republican) opposed his candidacy and denounced him as a charlatan and a racist. White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu stated that \"The President is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past.\"\n\nThe Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism rallied against Duke's gubernatorial campaign. Beth Rickey, a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a PhD student at Tulane University, began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her of his worldview: the Holocaust was a myth, notorious Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele was a medical genius, and that blacks and Jews were responsible for various social ills. Rickey released transcripts of their conversations to the press and also provided evidence establishing that Duke sold Nazi literature (including \"Mein Kampf\") from his legislative office and attended neo-Nazi political gatherings while he held elective office.\n\nBetween the primary and the runoff, called the \"general election\" under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), white supremacist organizations from around the country contributed to Duke's campaign fund.\n\nDuke's rise garnered national media attention. While he gained the backing of the quixotic former Alexandria Mayor John K. Snyder, Duke won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands of dollars to former Governor Edwin Edwards' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: \"Vote for the Crook. It's Important\", and \"Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard.\" When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: \"Stay alive.\"\n\nThe runoff debate, held on November 6, 1991, received significant attention when journalist Norman Robinson questioned Duke. Robinson, who is African-American, told Duke that he was \"scared\" at the prospect of Duke winning the election because of his history of \"diabolical, evil, vile\" racist and antisemitic comments, some of which he read to Duke. He then pressed Duke for an apology and when Duke protested that Robinson was not being fair to him, Robinson replied that he didn't think Duke was being honest. Jason Berry of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"startling TV\" and the \"catalyst\" for the \"overwhelming\" turnout of black voters who helped Edwards defeat Duke.\n\nEdwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%), while Duke's 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke nevertheless claimed victory, saying, \"I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote\", a statistic confirmed by exit polls.\n\nDuke ran as a Republican in the 1992 presidential primaries, although Republican Party officials tried to block his participation. He received 119,115 (0.94%) votes in the primaries, but no delegates to the national convention.\n\nA 1992 film, \"Backlash: Race and the American Dream\", investigated Duke's appeal among some white voters. \"Backlash\" explored the demagogic issues of Duke's platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy and tied Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as Lester G. Maddox and George Wallace, and the use in the successful 1988 presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush of these same racially themed hot buttons.\n\nWhen Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the U.S. Senate. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge and Democrat Mary Landrieu of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, jungle primary race.\n\nA special election was held in Louisiana's First Congressional District following the sudden resignation of powerful Republican incumbent Bob Livingston in 1999. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans. Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson remarked: \"There is no room in the party of Lincoln for a Klansman like David Duke.\" Republican state representative David Vitter (later a U.S. Senator) went on to defeat former governor Treen. Also in the race was the New Orleans Republican leader Rob Couhig.\n\nDuke organized a weekend gathering of \"European Nationalists\" in Kenner, Louisiana. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division in the white nationalist movement that had followed the death of leader William Pierce in 2002, Duke presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image for outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the \"New Orleans Protocol\" (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organizations, it has three provisions:\n\nThose who signed the pact on May 29, 2004, include Duke, Don Black, Paul Fromm, Willis Carto (whose Holocaust-denying \"Barnes Review\" helped sponsor the event), Kevin Alfred Strom, and John Tyndall (signing as an individual, not on behalf of his British National Party).\n\nThe SPLC noted that the \"high tone\" of the NOP contrasted with statements at the event where the pact was signed, such as Paul Fromm's calling a Muslim woman \"a hag in a bag\" and Sam Dickson (from the Council of Conservative Citizens, another sponsor) speaking about the \"very, very destructive\" effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II—opposition that caused people to view Hitler's \"normal, healthy racial values\" as evil. The SPLC described the NOP as a \"smokescreen,\" saying that \"most of the conference participants' ire was directed at what they consider to be a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy the white race through immigration and miscegenation\".\n\nDuke joined the Reform Party in 1999 while working for Pat Buchanan's 2000 presidential campaign. Duke and Buchanan would both leave the party after the election.\n\nIn 2004, Duke's bodyguard, roommate, and longtime associate Roy Armstrong made a bid for the United States House of Representatives, running as a Democrat, to serve Louisiana's First Congressional District. In the open primary, Armstrong finished second in the six candidate field with 6.69% of the vote, but Republican Bobby Jindal received 78.40%, thus winning the seat. Duke was the head advisor of Armstrong's campaign.\n\nDuke claimed that thousands of Tea Party movement activists had urged him to run for president in 2012, and that he was seriously considering entering the Republican Party primaries. However, Duke ultimately did not contest the primaries won by Mitt Romney, who lost in the presidential election to incumbent Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2015, it was reported in the media that Duke endorsed 2016 presidential nominee Donald Trump for president. Duke responded on his personal website by saying that he had not actually endorsed Trump. He later clarified in an interview with \"The Daily Beast\" in August 2015 that while he viewed Trump as \"the best of the lot\", due to his stance on immigration, Trump's support for Israel was a deal breaker for him. Duke claimed that \"Trump has made it very clear that he's 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?\" In December 2015, Duke said Donald Trump speaks more radically than he does, advising that Trump's radical speech is both a positive and a negative. In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote Trump, saying that voting for anyone besides Donald Trump \"is really treason to your heritage.\" In 2016, someone claiming to be David Duke filed a lawsuit in a federal court attempting to bar Trump from the Florida presidential primary. The real Duke referred to the hoax as \"the biggest, dirtiest trick I've seen recently\".\n\nOn July 22, 2016, Duke announced that he was planning to run for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat in Louisiana being vacated by Republican David Vitter. He stated that he was running \"to defend the rights of European Americans\". He claimed that his platform has become the Republican mainstream and added, \"I'm overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I've championed for years.\" However, Trump's campaign reaffirmed that Trump disavows Duke's support, and Republican organizations said they will not support him \"under any circumstances\". On August 5, 2016, National Public Radio (NPR) aired an interview between Duke and Steve Inskeep in which Duke claimed that there was widespread racism against European Americans, that they have been subject to vicious attacks in the media, and that Trump's voters were also his voters.\n\nA Mason-Dixon poll released on October 20, 2016, showed Duke receiving support from 5.1% of voters in the state, barely clearing the 5% requirement for a candidate to be allowed to participate in a November 2 debate.\n\nDuke received 3% of the vote on Election Day, with a total of 58,581 votes out of nearly 2 million cast. He came in 7th place in Louisiana's open primary.\n\nThose who made donations to the campaign were publicly outed in several states in 2017, leading to boycotts, lost business, and one restaurant to close entirely.\n\nDuke promotes the white genocide conspiracy theory and explicitly claims that Jews are \"organising white genocide\". In 2017 he accused Anthony Bourdain of promoting white genocide.\n\nIn 1974, Duke founded the Louisiana-based Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKKK), shortly after graduating from LSU. He became Grand Wizard of the KKKK. A follower of Duke, Thomas Robb, changed the title of Grand Wizard to National Director, and replaced the Klan's white robes with business suits. Duke first received broad public attention during this time, as he endeavored to market himself in the mid-1970s as a new brand of Klansman: well-groomed, engaged, and professional. Duke also reformed the organization, promoting nonviolence and legality, and, for the first time in the Klan's history, women were accepted as equal members and Catholics were encouraged to apply for membership. Duke would repeatedly insist that the Klan was \"not anti-black\" but rather \"pro-white\" and \"pro-Christian.\" Duke told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that he left the Klan in 1980 because he disliked its associations with violence and could not stop the members of other Klan chapters from doing \"stupid or violent things.\"\n\nIn 1980, Duke left the Klan and formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP), a white nationalist organization.\n\nDuke expressed support for Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel, a German emigrant in Canada. Duke made a number of statements supporting Zündel and his campaign of Holocaust denial. Zündel was deported from Canada to Germany and imprisoned in Germany on charges of inciting the masses to ethnic hatred. After Zündel died in August 2017, Duke referred to him as being a \"very heroic and courageous European preservationist\".\n\nIn September 2005, Duke received a non-accredited \"PhD in history\" from the Ukrainian private university Interregional Academy of Personnel Management (MAUP), an institution that has been described by the Anti-Defamation League as a \"University of Hate.\" Duke's doctoral thesis was titled \"Zionism as a Form of Ethnic Supremacism.\" However, the PhD program of MAUP was not accredited by the Higher Attestation Commission of Ukraine and is not accredited by that state body's successor, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, so the PhD diplomas issued by MAUP are not recognized by the Ukrainian state as real academic degrees.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League claims that MAUP is the main source of antisemitic activity and publishing in Ukraine, and its \"anti-Semitic actions\" were \"strongly condemned\" by Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and various organizations.\n\nDuke has taught a course on international relations and a history course at MAUP. On his website, Duke now refers to himself as \"Dr. David Duke\" and \"Dr. Duke.\"\n\nDuke has taken part in Iranian government sponsored events in Iran. In 2006, at the invitation of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Duke took part in an event held in Tehran to question the Holocaust. \"The Zionists have used the Holocaust as a weapon to deny the rights of the Palestinians and cover up the crimes of Israel,\" Duke told a gathering of nearly 70 participants in Tehran at Ahmadinejad's invitation. \"This conference has an incredible impact on Holocaust studies all over the world,\" said Duke.\n\nIn 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a bulletin board system (BBS) called \"Stormfront\". The website has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism, white separatism, holocaust denial, neo-Nazism, hate speech and racism. Duke is an active user of \"Stormfront\", where he posts articles from his own website and polls forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his Internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects, including Operation Red Dog (the attempted overthrowing of Dominica's government) in 1980.\n\nIn 2000, Nick Griffin (then leader of the British National Party in the United Kingdom) met with Duke at a seminar with the American Friends of the British National Party. Griffin said:\n\nThis was widely reported in the media of the United Kingdom, as well as the meeting between Duke and Griffin, following electoral successes made by the party in 2009.\n\nDuke has written in praise of the alt-right, describing one broadcast as \"fun and interesting\" and another as \"this great show\". People for the American Way reported Duke championing the alt-right. Duke described them as \"our people\" when describing their role in Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nThere are also claims that whilst he is not an active member of the alt-right, he is an inspiration for the movement. The \"International Business Times\" described Duke as having 'Zieg-heiling acolytes in the so-called \"alt-right\"'. \"The Forward\" has said that Duke \"paved the way\" for the alt-right movement.\n\nTo raise money in 1976, Duke (using the double pseudonym James Konrad and Dorothy Vanderbilt) wrote a self-help book for women, \"Finders-Keepers: Finding and Keeping the Man You Want\". which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, and was published by Arlington Place Books, an offshoot of the National Socialist White People's Party. Tulane University history professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare copy of the book given to him by journalist Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises, oral and anal sex and advocated adultery. The puritan inclined Klan was shocked by Duke's writing. According to journalist Tyler Bridges, \"The Times-Picayune\" obtained a copy and traced its provenance to Duke, who compiled the content from women's self-help magazines. Duke has admitted being Konrad.\n\nIn 1998, Duke published the autobiographical \"\". The book details Duke's social philosophies, particularly his reasoning in support of racial separation:\n\nWe [Whites] desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League book review refers to it as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic views.\n\nTo raise the money to republish a new, updated edition of \"My Awakening\", Duke instigated a 21-day fundraising drive on November 26, 2007, stating he had to raise \"$25,344 by a December 17 deadline for the printers.\" Duke states the drive was necessary because the work \"has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom.\"\n\nIn 2001, Duke traveled to Russia to promote his next book, \"Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question\", in which he purports to \"examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times.\" The book is dedicated to Israel Shahak, a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former Boris Yeltsin press minister Boris Mironov wrote an introduction for the Russian edition, printed under the title \"The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American\".\n\nThe ADL office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation into Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from Alexander Fedulov, a prominent member of the Duma, to Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke's book. In his letter, Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and a violation of Russian anti-hate crime laws. Around December 2001, the prosecutor's office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and Jewish Supremacism. In a public letter, Yury Biryukov, First Deputy of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, stated that a psychological examination, which was conducted as a part of the investigation, concluded that the book and the actions of Boris Mironov did not break Russian hate-crime laws.\n\nThe ADL referred to the book as antisemitic, though Duke had denied the claim that the book is motivated by antisemitism. At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament). The first printing of 5,000 copies sold out in several weeks.\n\nIn 2004, the book was published in the United States. Originally published in English and Russian, the book has subsequently been translated internationally into Swedish, Ukrainian, Persian, Hungarian, Spanish and most recently (2010) into Finnish. In 2007, an updated edition was published which Duke purports to be a \"fine quality hardback edition with full color dust jacket and it has a new index and a number of timely additions\".\n\nIn 2006, Duke said his views had been \"vindicated\" with the publication of \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\" by professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, and said he was \"surprised how excellent [the paper] is\". Duke dedicated several radio webcasts to the book and the authors comparing it to his work \"Jewish Supremacism\", although Walt stated: \"I have always found Mr. Duke's views reprehensible, and I am sorry he sees this article as consistent with his view of the world\".\n\nHis website has hosted articles by various authors claiming that Jewish loan-sharks own the Federal Reserve Bank, and that Jews own Hollywood and the U.S. media. Duke also opposes what he considers to be \"promotion of homosexuality\" by Jews.\n\nIn a statement on his official website published in 2005, Duke describes himself as a \"racial realist,\" asserting that \"all people have a basic human right to preserve their own heritage.\"\n\nOn February 5, 2002, Duke said on his Internet broadcast that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was \"the world's worst terrorist\" and that Mossad was involved in the September 11 attacks. The broadcast said that Zionists were behind the attacks in order to reduce sympathy for Muslim nations in the West, and that the number of Israelis killed in the attack was lower than it would be under normal circumstances, citing early assessments by \"The Jerusalem Post\" and \"the legendary involvement of Israeli nationals in businesses at the World Trade Center\". According to Duke, this indicated that Israeli security services had prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nOn November 24, 2005, Duke visited Damascus, Syria, addressing a rally broadcast on Syrian television and giving an interview. During the rally, he referred to Israel as a \"war-mongering country\" and stated that Zionists \"occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government … It is not just the West Bank of Palestine, it is not just the Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists, but Washington, D.C., and New York and London and many other capitals of the world.\" He concluded by stating: \"Your fight for freedom is the same as our fight for freedom.\" In a second interview, he said Israel \"makes the Nazi state look very, very moderate.\" Syrian parliament member Mohammad Habash, leader of the Islamic revivalist movement in Syria, later stated that Duke's visit gave Syrians a \"new and very positive view of the average American.\"\n\nSince 2005, Duke has appeared three times on \"Current Issues\", a Lafayette, Louisiana–based television show hosted and produced by Palestinian-American Hesham Tillawi, which has recently been picked up by Bridges TV. Tillawi gave Duke the opportunity to discourse at length about his beliefs on Jewish supremacism. On a show in October 2005, Duke claimed that Jewish extremists are responsible for undermining the morality of America and are attempting to \"wash the world in blood.\"\n\nAfter Mearsheimer and Walt's paper on the Israel lobby appeared in March 2006, Duke praised the paper in a number of articles on his website, on his March 18 web broadcast, and on MSNBC's March 21 \"Scarborough Country\" program. According to \"The New York Sun\", Duke said in an email, \"It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American university essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war even started.\" Duke added that \"the task before us is to wrest control of America's foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the Jewish extremist Neocons that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV.\"\n\nIn 2015, after 47 Senate Republicans warned Iran that agreements made with the US that were not ratified by the Senate were liable to be repudiated by a future President, Duke told Fox News' Alan Colmes that the signatories \"should become a Jew, put on a yarmulke because they are not Americans, they have sold their soul to the Jewish power in this country and the Jewish power overseas.\"\n\nDuke organized a gathering of European Nationalists who signed the New Orleans Protocol on May 29, 2004. The signatories agreed to avoid infighting among far-right racialists.\n\nOn June 3, 2005, Duke co-chaired a conference named \"Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization\" in Ukraine, sponsored by the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management. The conference was attended by several notable Ukrainian public figures and politicians, and writer Israel Shamir.\n\nDuke claims that Swedish police thwarted an attempted assassination against him, in August 2005, while Duke was speaking in Sweden.\n\nOn the weekend of June 8–10, 2006, Duke attended as a speaker at the international \"White World's Future\" conference in Moscow, which was coordinated and hosted by Pavel Tulayev. From December 11–13, Duke attended the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran, Iran, opened by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, stating \"The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder.\"\n\nIn \"Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust and David Duke's Louisiana\" Lawrence N. Powell, a founding member of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, depicts the \"story of Anne Skorecki Levy, a Holocaust survivor who transformed the horrors of her childhood into a passionate mission to defeat the political menace of reputed neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.\"\n\nOn December 12, 2002, David Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under and mail fraud under According to \"The New York Times\": \"Mr. Duke was accused of telling supporters that he was in financial straits, then misusing the money they sent him from 1993 to 1999. He was also accused of filing a false 1998 tax return... Mr. Duke used the money for personal investments and gambling trips... [T]he [supporter] contributions were as small as $5 and [according to the United States attorney, Jim Letten] there were so many that returning the money would be 'unwieldy.'\"\n\nFour months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in Big Spring, Texas. He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the United States federal court system and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.\n\nThe mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.\n\nThe Smoking Gun posted the entire file of court documents related to this case at its website, including details on Duke's guilty pleas.\n\nIn April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on invitation by a Czech neo-Nazi group known as \"Národní Odpor\" (\"National Resistance\") to deliver three lectures in Prague and Brno to promote the Czech translation of his book \"My Awakening\". He was arrested on April 23 on suspicion of \"denying or approving of the Nazi genocide and other Nazi crimes\" and \"promotion of movements seeking suppression of human rights,\" which are crimes in the Czech Republic punishable by up to three years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest, Duke was reportedly guarded by members of the \"Národní Odpor\".\n\nThe police released him early on April 25 on condition that he leave the country by midnight that same day.\n\nDuke's first lecture had been scheduled at Charles University in Prague, but it was canceled after university officials learned that neo-Nazis were planning to attend. Some Czech politicians, including Interior Minister Ivan Langer and Human Rights and Minorities Minister Michael Kocáb, had previously expressed opposition to Duke's being allowed entrance into the Czech Republic.\n\nIn September 2009, the office of the District Prosecutor for Prague dropped all charges, explaining that there was no evidence that Duke had committed any crime.\n\nIn 2013, an Italian court ruled in favor of expelling Duke from Italy. Duke, then 63, was living in mountain village Valle di Cadore in northern Italy. Although Duke had been issued a visa to live there by the Italian embassy in Malta, Italian police later found that Switzerland had issued a residence ban against Duke that applied throughout Europe's Schengen Area.\n\nWhile working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Eleanor Hardin, who was also active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke's two daughters, Erika and Kristin. The Dukes divorced in 1984, and Chloe moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, in order to be near her parents. There, she became involved with Duke's Klan friend Don Black, whom she later married. Duke rented out an apartment in Moscow beginning around 1999. He lived in Russia for five years. Duke currently resides in Mandeville, Louisiana.\n\nDuke is portrayed by actor Topher Grace in the 2018 Spike Lee film \"BlacKkKlansman\". He also appears in the film directly, in footage taken from the Unite the Right rally.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nFilmography\n"}
{"id": "250464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=250464", "title": "Deterministic system (philosophy)", "text": "Deterministic system (philosophy)\n\nA deterministic system is a conceptual model of the philosophical doctrine of determinism applied to a system for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of causality. In a deterministic system, every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, in turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.\n\nTo understand this concept, start with a fairly small system. Visualize a set of three dominoes lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino's length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has toppled, the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino.\n\nSmall deterministic systems are easy to visualize, but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and/or final effect. To go back to the dominoes, something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple. The last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen. And the system itself must be considered in isolation—if external forces such as hurricanes, earthquakes or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration, the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome. Complete isolation of a system is unrealistic, but useful for understanding what would normally happen to a system when the possibility of external influences is negligible. Complex physical systems are necessarily built using simpler ones, and using isolated systems as a starting model can help bridge the gap and aid in understanding. The domino example is developed in the Petri net computational model.\n\nThis example assumes that dominoes toppling into each other behave deterministically. Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt the system are causes which the system did not consider, but which could be explained by cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.\n\n\nEvents without natural causes cannot be part of a deterministic system. Whether such events actually occur is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate – however, possible uncaused events include:\n\nSome systems are particularly difficult to classify as deterministic or not, and have generated much philosophical debate. The major example would be human minds, and possibly animal minds too. Can people have free will if their minds are truly deterministic? Conversely, when deterministic computers are said to exhibit artificial intelligence, how are their minds similar to ours?\n\nThe larger the deterministic system, the longer the necessary chain of cause and effect. The entire universe may be considered as such a system, which creates its own philosophical questions (see Determinism).\n\n"}
{"id": "25714482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25714482", "title": "Disability abuse", "text": "Disability abuse\n\nDisability abuse is when a person with a disability is abused physically, financially, sexually and/or psychologically due to the person having a disability. Since many disabilities are not visible (for example, asthma, schizophrenia, or learning disabilities) some abusers cannot rationalise the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. Since some disabled people are in need of additional support from others throughout their lives, they are also vulnerable to neglect. Disability abuse has also been considered a hate crime. The abuse is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip but also those with learning disabilities or difficulties such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, and other disabilities, including autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome and developmental coordination disorder. In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an unthinking physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools. There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a care institution, such as the case revealed in a BBC \"Panorama\" programme on a Castlebeck care home (Winterbourne View) near Bristol which led to its closure and the suspension or dismissal of some of the staff.\n\nThose with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain. There was one study done that shows 60 percent of the children with disabilities come forth about being bullied regularly, versus 25 percent of the students who are being bullied with no disabilities. This can also affect their learning and school and education. Their grades are more at risk in dropping, they have a more difficult time concentrating, and there is no interest in school and the learning material. All of this can lead to the child dropping out of school.\n\nThere have been numerous cases of parents of children with disabilities who have murdered their children because of their disabilities. Sometimes the parents kill themselves alongside their child. It was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity—\"As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live.\" and is documented in various indigenous societies. \nDisabled girls and women are particularly vulnerable to abuse.\n\nBullying is an aggressive behavior or attitude towards a person that is unwanted. It is usually a repeated behavior. There is more than just one type of bullying, there is verbal bullying, social, and physical. Verbal bullying consist of name calling a person, teasing, and threatening to cause harm to the person. Social abuse is intentionally leaving a person out while in a social setting or gathering, or taunting the person. Physical abuse consist of hitting or pushing someone, pulling their hair, tripping them, or breaking their belongings intentionally. Bullying happens usually before or after school hours, and it is usually done on campus or on the playground of the school. However, it can also happen while on the school bus or going to and from the school bus. Bullying can also happen through the internet or through the phone as well, this is known as cyber bullying.\n\nA 2012 survey by the Interactive Autism Network found that 63% of children with autism are bullied in the United States.\n\nOver a third of autistic adults said they had been bullied at work in a survey by the UK's National Autistic Society.\n\n82% of children with learning disability in the UK are bullied, according to Mencap, and 79% are scared to go out in case they are bullied.\n\nA survey that was done shows that roughly 7 out of 10 people with disabilities have been abused, and that it is an ongoing problem. It was also found that bullying people with disabilities is a problem that is going on in different countries as well, and that problem is not always surfaced and given attention to.\n\nBullying is also a cause of disability and exacerbates existing disabilities.\n\nBullying can take occur in a variety of forms. They aren't always physical. Verbal bullying and nonverbal bullying are the ones that occur very often. Catherine Thornberry and Karin Olson claim that carers often dehumanize disabled people, taking away their abilities and qualities that make them a person and lowering them to the level of just an object or a thing. They found that the caregivers or assistants are often the ones who are unintentionally bullying the disabled individuals. The caregivers look at the individuals at lower standard than they do other people, leading to their labeling of disabled individuals as a hate crime.\n\nBullying a child with a disability is considered to be harassment.\n\nDisabled people are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than the general population for numerous reasons. As they are less likely to report what has happened to them, their rapists are able to get away with the abuse. Victims often not taken seriously due to ableism which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.\n\nAccording to Valenti-Hein & Schwartz, only 3% of sexual abuse cases involving developmentally disabled people are ever reported, more than 90% of developmentally disabled people will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives, and 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.\n\nA study published in the \"British Journal of Psychiatry\" by Sequeira, Howlin, & Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and behavioural disorder in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.\n\nSexual abuse is less likely to be reported by individuals with disabilities. The people that surround these individuals are often found to be less likely to report these cases of abuse. Society sees the disabled as weak and vulnerable targets, making it easy for the abuser to not feel guilty or to blame themselves. More often than not people figure they can trust their physicians or doctors who provide care for these individuals. In a clinical study it was found that the physicians would provide poor quality of care to individuals with disabilities. They would suppress the problems instead of addressing them by giving them drugs to make them be quiet. It was also found that physicians were less likely to report sexual abuse or any abuse that they found present on these individuals. The justified these actions by believing that in society that disabled people matter less than any other person.\n\nExtreme disability abuse can lead directly or indirectly to death.

This decreases the amount of physical damage done in a disrupted landscape. An example is using willow in a stream corridor for sediment and phosphorus capture. It aims to aid ecological restoration which, is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Humans ecosynthesis to make environments more suitable for life, through restoration ecology (introduced species, vegetation mapping, habitat enhancement, remediation and mitigation.) \n\n A controversial science of applying ecosynthesis to other planets to make them habitable like Earth. This is a futuristic science that has almost no hold on society today due to its large manufacturing costs and level of technology available.\n\nEcological restoration aims to recreate, initiate, or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.\n\nRevegetation: the establishment of vegetation on sites where it has been previously lost, often with erosion control as the primary goal.\n\nHabitat enhancement: the process of increasing the suitability of a site as habitat for some desired species.\n\nRemediation: improving an existing ecosystem or creating a new one with the aim of replacing another that has deteriorated or been destroyed.\n\nMitigation: legally mandated remediation for loss of protected species or an ecosystem.\n\nThrough restoration ecology humans can help ecosystems that we have either caused harm to or disturbed be brought back to functional state.\n\n A clear example of humans ecosynthesiszing would be through the introduction of a species to cause a trophic cascade, which is the result of indirect effects between nonadjacent trophic levels in a food chain or food web, such as the top predator in a food chain and a plant. The most famous example of a trophic cascade is that of the introduction of wolves to YellowStone National Park, which had extradionary effects to the ecosystem. Yellowstone National Park had a massive population of elk because they had no predators, which caused the local aspen population and other vegetation to significantly decrease in population size. However, the introduction of wolves controlled the elk population and indirectly affected the aspen and other vegetation. This brought the ecosystem back to a sustainable life.\n\n"}

They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be. Error bars often represent one standard deviation of uncertainty, one standard error, or a particular confidence interval (e.g., a 95% interval). These quantities are not the same and so the measure selected should be stated explicitly in the graph or supporting text.\n\nError bars can be used to compare visually two quantities if various other conditions hold. This can determine whether differences are statistically significant. Error bars can also suggest goodness of fit of a given function, i.e., how well the function describes the data. Scientific papers in the experimental sciences are expected to include error bars on all graphs, though the practice differs somewhat between sciences, and each journal will have its own house style. It has also been shown that error bars can be used as a direct manipulation interface for controlling probabilistic algorithms for approximate computation. Error bars can also be expressed in a plus-minus sign (±), plus the upper limit of the error and minus the lower limit of the error.\n\nA notorious misconception in elementary statistics is that error bars show whether or not a statistically significant difference exists, by checking simply for whether or not the error bars overlap; this is not the case.\n\n"}
{"id": "43986834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43986834", "title": "Ethical dualism", "text": "Ethical dualism\n\nEthical dualism (from ancient Greek ἔθος (o ἦθος), ethos,\"character\", \"custom\", and Latin duo, \"two\") refers to the practice of imputing evil entirely and exclusively to a specific group of people, while disregarding or denying one's own capacity to commit evil.\n\nThe consequence of such stance is the creation of an \"Us\" versus \"Them\", thereby polarizing social configurations into extremes in a way that mutual understanding between the two \"poles\" is made very difficult or impossible, since the \"Them\", the \"Other\", is demonized, dehumanized.\n\nIn other words, ethical dualism basically pictures the existence of two mutually hostile entities, the one representing the origin of all Good and the other of all Evil.\n\nIn relation to the theory of dualism in its broader philosophical and metaphysical sense, it is useful to point out how ethical dualism differs from it or what it adds to it.\n\nDualism is a theory which interprets any given situation in terms of two contrasting elements, which from a metaphysical point of view comes to imply that reality consists of two fundamental types of existence which cannot be reduced to each other. Examples of metaphysical dualisms are those between spirit and matter, God and the world, or, as theorized by Descartes, between thought and extension.\n\nEthical dualism on the other hand highlights the moral dimension instead or in addition to the metaphysical one, and envisions an inherent situation of conflict between two antagonistic forces, like light and darkness, Good and Evil.\n\nOne of the most known and clear-cut interpretations of ethical dualism is the one conceptualized by Zoroastrianism, the ancient Persian religion, which bases its thought on the figure of the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), who claimed the existence of two original and contrasting principles, Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, respectively representing the forces of Good and Evil. The world is therefore identified as the battleground between these two contrasting entities, also associated with light and darkness.\n\n\"Each man and woman, for his or her self, select either of the two […] The worst mind shall be for the wrongful, and the best mind shall be for the righteous.\" – Yasna 30, 17 Gatha Hymns\n\nAlso, in Zoroastrianism, there is no room for reconcilement between the two opposing forces of good and evil:\n\n\"Neither our thoughts, not teachings, nor intellects, nor choices, nor words, nor deeds, nor consciences, nor souls agree.\" – Yasna 45, Ushtavaiti Gatha Song 10: Proclamation (The Two Spirits)\n\nZoroastrianism and its doctrine of ethical dualism influenced the Jews and their thinking, as there is general agreement among scholars that the Jewish apocalypticism presents traits of dualism.\n\nThe Jews first came across Zoroastrian philosophy when the Persian King Cyrus freed them from their Babylonian captivity and allowed them to return to their homeland in the 6th century BCE. Therefore, it is possible that during this period the two peoples exchanged ideas about their view of the world, which would explain the clear reference to ethical dualism expressed and reformulated in Jewish terms in Chapter 31:15 of the Deuteronomy, the 5th book of the Torah:\n\n\"See, today I set before you life and prosperity, death and disaster. If you obey the commandments of YHVH your God that I enjoin on you today, if you love YHVH your God and follow His ways, if you keep His commandments, His laws, His customs, you will live and increase, and YHVH your God will bless you in the land which you are entering to make your own. But if your heart strays, if you refuse to listen, if you let yourself be drawn into worshipping other gods and serving them, I tell you today, you will most certainly perish […] I set before you life or death, blessing or curse. Choose life, then, so that you and your descendants may live\" - Deut. 31:15-19, Jerusalem Bible translation.\n\nChristianity also presents some kind of relation to the concept of Ethical dualism, as it built on some Zoroastrianized Jewish concepts. For example, the Prologue to the Gospel of John contains many elements of ethical dualism, such as the light/darkness metaphor:\n\"In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.\" – John 1:4-5, Bible\n\n\"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God\" - John 3:19-21, Bible\n\nAlso, the figure of Satan is considered by some scholars to be quite similar to the Zoroastrian Ahriman, representing the \"Adversary\", the evil spirit who chose to do evil and who corrupts people and the physical world. However, unlike Zoroastrianism, Christian theology does not consider Satan, the Devil, to be original or ultimate like Ahriman, he is instead a deteriorated creature who corrupts people into committing evil, in line with the Christian rejection of any second eternal being coexistent with God.\n\nThroughout history, the interpretation of events and situation from an Ethical dualism perspective has target different groups of people, such as the nobility, the Jews, the bourgeoisie, the corporate elite, Muslims, and many others.\n\nAll these cases were and are characterized by a situation of injustice, which pushed people belonging to a certain group to associate and link such injustice entirely on the group which is perceived to have caused it, thereby leading to a situation of extreme social polarization, where dialogue between groups becomes stiff or impossible.\n\nIn Christian theology, Ethical dualisms are avertible if one considers the Christian doctrine of Original Sin, which is said to affect all humans equally; therefore evil cannot be seen as the exclusive domain of a determined class or group of people. Hence the conflict between Good and Evil that characterizes the Ethical view of dualism comes to exist only in the dimension of consciousness of every human being, so that Evil arises in the world through his/her wrong choices and actions.\n\nIn The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn also expressed a similar view:\n\n\"If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?\"\n\n\"\"Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts.\"\"\n\nAnother interpretation of Ethical dualism has been formulated by the theologian and realist Reinhold Niebuhr (1892 – 1971), who stressed the relativity of every moral and ethical choice. While trying to find the relation between individual and group ethics, he stressed the complexity of any social situation and resorted to a new formula of \"dualistic ethics\".\n\nNiebuhr analysed the injustice of modern industrial civilization and emphasized the contrast between \"moral man and immoral society\":\"Individual men may be moral in the sense that they are able to consider interests other than their own in determining problems of conduct, and are capable, on occasion, of preferring the advantages of others to their own […] But all these achievements are more difficult, if not impossible, for human societies and social groups. In every human group there is less reason to guide and to check impulse, less capacity for self-transcendence, less ability to comprehend the need of others and therefore more unrestrained egoism than the individuals, who compose the groups, reveal in their personal relationships.\"Therefore, according to Niebuhr, man as an individual is naturally provided with some unselfish impulses to which he is obliged by his conscience. However, when acting as a member of a group, man appears overwhelmed by moral inability, since the group lacks the organs of sensitivity of the individual. Hence, in Niebuhr's view, ethical dualism should be employed to point out the impossibility of reconciling such conflict between individual and societal ethics under one single ethical program.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62433", "title": "Evaluation", "text": "Evaluation\n\nEvaluation is a\nsystematic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of standards. It can assist an organization, program, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and objectives and results of any such action that has been completed. The primary purpose of evaluation, in addition to gaining insight into prior or existing initiatives, is to enable reflection and assist in the identification of future change.\n\nEvaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the arts, criminal justice, foundations, non-profit organizations, government, health care, and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.\n\nEvaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be formative, that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be summative, drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.\n\nEvaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its contextthe theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:\n\nThe main purpose of a program evaluation can be to \"determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment\" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009).\n\nAn alternative view is that \"projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value.\"\nFrom this perspective, evaluation \"is a contested term\", as \"evaluators\" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.\n\nThere are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.\n\nNot all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile. This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework, drawing on a number of disciplines, which include management and organisational theory, policy analysis, education, sociology, social anthropology, and social change.\n\nHowever, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face.\n\nIt is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the evaluand (client) (Datta, 2006). One justification of this is that \"when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing\" (Fournier and Smith, 1993). Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process.\n\nNone of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980).\n\nThe development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.\n\nDepending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and rigor of evaluation processes.\n\nEvaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be ethically challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter \"conflict of interest (COI)\" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.\n\nGeneral professional codes of conduct, as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter-collegial relations (such as respect for diversity and privacy), operational issues (due competence, documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest (nepotism, accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism). However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.\n\nThe American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding Principles for evaluators. The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:\n\nIndependence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation\nconclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of\ninterest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of\ninterest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies\nwith a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the\nindependence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with\nagencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have\nbeen involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should\nbe made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is\nrequired to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by\nproject funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than\nfindings can verify.\nImpartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and\nweaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved\nand findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link\nbetween findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to\nevidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is\nrequired of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is\nbased on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings\nand recommendations.\nTransparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria\nby which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the\nevaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear\nexplanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs\nincurred.\n\n\nFurthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide UN Evaluation Group (UNEG), that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards. The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.\n\nThe word \"evaluation\" has various connotations for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness?\n\nThere are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program. Michael Quinn Patton motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:\n\n\nFounded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation\n\nThere exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.\n\nTwo classifications of evaluation approaches by House and Stufflebeam and Webster can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles.\n\nHouse considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common ideology entitled liberal democracy. Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the individual and empirical inquiry grounded in objectivity. He also contends that they are all based on subjectivist ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is utilitarian, in which \"the good\" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is intuitionist/pluralist, in which no single interpretation of \"the good\" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.\n\nThese ethical positions have corresponding epistemologies—philosophies for obtaining knowledge. The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed methods and data. The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on consumers and participatory approaches.\n\nStufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of values and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be—they call this pseudo-evaluation. The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object—they call this quasi-evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object—they call this true evaluation.\n\nWhen the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation. Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them—experimental research, management information systems, testing programs, objectives-based studies, and content analysis—take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and policy studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and connoisseur studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and client-centered studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.\n\nThe following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four attributes—organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired outcome for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together.\n\nPolitically controlled and public relations studies are based on an from an elite perspective. Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. Information obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in real scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.\n\nAs a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation is methodologically diverse. Methods may be qualitative or quantitative, and include case studies, survey research, statistical analysis, model building, and many more such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, and these algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single functor \"F\", the \"signature\".\n\n\"F\"-algebras can also be used to represent data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees.\n\nThe main related concepts are initial \"F\"-algebras which may serve to encapsulate the induction principle, and the dual construction \"F\"-coalgebras.\n\nIf \"C\" is a category, and \"F\": \"C\" → \"C\" is an endofunctor of \"C\", then an \"F\"-algebra is a tuple (\"A\", α), where \"A\" is an object of \"C\" and α is a \"C\"-morphism \"F\"(\"A\") → \"A\". The object \"A\" is called \"carrier\" of the algebra. When it is permissible from context, algebras are often referred to by their carrier only instead of the tuple.\n\nA homomorphism from an \"F\"-algebra (\"A\", α) to an \"F\"-algebra (\"B\", β) is a \"C\"-morphism \"f\": \"A\"→ \"B\" such that \"f\" α = β \"F\"(\"f\"), according to the following diagram:\n\nEquipped with these morphisms, \"F\"-algebras constitute a category.\n\nThe dual construction are \"F\"-coalgebras, which are objects \"A\" together with a morphism α : \"A\" → \"F\"(\"A\").\n\nClassically, a group is a set \"G\" with a binary operation \"m\" : \"G\" × \"G\" → \"G\", satisfying three axioms: \n\n\nNote that the axiom of closure is included in the symbolic definition of \"m\".\n\nTo treat this in a categorical framework, we first define the identity and inverse as functions (morphisms of set in a category) \"e\" and \"i\" respectively. Let C be an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. The group \"G\" is an object in C. The identity function \"e\" sends each element in * to 1, the identity element in the group \"G\". The inverse function \"i\" sends each element \"x\" in \"G\" to its inverse \"x\", satisfying \"m\"(\"x\", \"x\") = \"m\"(\"x\", \"x\") = 1. Then a group \"G\" can be defined as a 4-tuple (\"G\", \"m\", \"e\", \"i\"), which describes a monoid category with only one object \"G\". Each morphism \"f\" in this monoid category has an inverse \"f\" that satisfies \"f\" \"f\" = \"f\" \"f\" = \"Id\".\n\nIt is then possible to rewrite the axioms in terms of functions (note how the existential quantifiers disappear):\n\nThen remove references to the elements of \"G\" (which will also remove universal quantifiers):\n\nWhich is the same as claiming commutativity for the following diagrams:\n\nNow use the coproduct (the disjoint union of sets) to glue the three morphisms in one: α = \"e\" + \"i\" + \"m\" according to\n\nThis defines a group as a F-algebra where F is the functor F(G) = 1 + \"G\" + \"G\" × \"G\".\n\nNote 1: The above construction is used to define group objects over an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. When the category admits finite coproducts, the group objects are F-algebra. For example, \nfinite groups are F-algebras in the category of finite sets and Lie groups are F-algebras in the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps.\n\nGoing one step ahead of universal algebra, most algebraic structures are F-algebras. For example, abelian groups are F-algebras for the same functor F(G) = 1 + \"G\" + \"G\"×\"G\" as for groups with an additional axiom for commutativity: \"m\"∘\"t\" = \"m\", where \"t\"(\"x\",\"y\") = (\"y\",\"x\") is the transpose on \"G\"x\"G\".\n\nMonoids, which generalize groups in that a monoid element does not need to have an inverse, are F-algebras of signature F(M) = 1 + \"M\"×\"M\". In the same vein, semigroups are F-algebras of signature F(S) = \"S\"×\"S\"\n\nRings, domains and fields are also F-algebras with a signature involving two laws +,•:\"R\"×\"R\" → R, an additive identity 0:1 → \"R\", a multiplicative identity 1:1 → \"R\", and an additive inverse for each element -:\"R\" → \"R\". As all these functions share the same codomain \"R\" they can be glued into a single signature function 1 + 1 + \"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" → \"R\", with axioms to express associativity, distributivity, and so on. This makes rings F-algebras on the category of sets with signature \n1 + 1 + \"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\".\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the functor F(\"R\") = 1 + \"R\"×\"R\" in the category of abelian groups. In that context, the multiplication is a homomorphism, meaning \"m\"(\"x\"+\"y\", \"z\") = \"m\"(\"x\",\"z\")+\"m\"(\"y\",\"z\") and \"m\"(\"x\",\"y\"+\"z\") = \"m\"(\"x\",\"y\")+\"m\"(\"x\",\"z\"), which are precisely the distributivity conditions. Therefore, a ring is an F-algebra of signature 1 + \"R\"×\"R\" over the category of abelian groups which satisfies two axioms (associativity and identity for the multiplication).\n\nWhen we come to vector spaces and modules, the signature functor includes a scalar multiplication \"k\"×\"E\" → \"E\", and the signature F(\"E\") = 1 + \"E\" + \"k\"×\"E\" is parametrized by \"k\" over the category of fields, or rings.\n\nAlgebras over a field can be viewed as F-algebras of signature 1 + 1 + \"A\" + \"A\"×\"A\" + \"A\"×\"A\" + \"k\"×\"A\" over the category of sets, of signature 1 + \"A\"×\"A\" over the category of modules (a module with an internal multiplication), and of signature \"k\"×\"A\" over the category of rings (a ring with a scalar multiplication), when they are associative and unitary.\n\nNot all mathematical structures are F-algebras. For example, a poset \"P\" may be defined in categorical terms with a morphism \"s\":\"P\"×\"P\" → Ω, on a subobject classifier (Ω = {0,1} in the category of set and \"s\"(\"x\",\"y\")=1 precisely when \"x\"≤\"y\"). The axioms restricting the morphism \"s\" to define a poset can be rewriten in terms of morphisms. However, as the codomain of \"s\" is Ω and not \"P\", it is not an F-algebra.\n\nHowever, lattices in which every two elements have a supremum and an infimum, and in particular total orders in which every two elements are comparable, are F-algebras. This is because they can equivalently be defined in terms of the algebraic operations: \"x\"∨\"y\" = inf(\"x\",\"y\") and \"x\"∧\"y\" = sup(\"x\",\"y\"), subject to certain axioms (commutativity, associativity, absorption and idempotency). Thus they are F-algebras of signature \"P\"x\"P\" + \"P\"x\"P\". It is often said that lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra.\n\nConsider the functor formula_2 that sends a set formula_3 to formula_4. Here, Set denotes the category of sets, formula_5 denotes the usual coproduct given by disjoint union, and 1 is a terminal object (i.e. any singleton set). Then the set formula_6 of natural numbers together with the function formula_7, which is the coproduct of the functions formula_8 (whose image is \"0\") and formula_9 (which sends an integer \"n\" to \"n+1\"), is an formula_10-algebra.\n\nIf the category of \"F\"-algebras for a given endofunctor \"F\" has an initial object, it is called an initial algebra. The algebra formula_11 in the above example is an initial algebra. Various finite data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors.\n\nTypes defined by using least fixed point construct with functor F can be regarded as an initial \"F\"-algebra, provided that parametricity holds for the type.\n\nSee also Universal algebra.\n\nIn a dual way, similar relationship exists between notions of greatest fixed point and terminal \"F\"-coalgebra, these can be used for allowing potentially infinite objects while maintaining strong normalization property. In the strongly normalizing Charity programming language (i.e. each program terminates in it), coinductive data types can be used achieving surprising results, e.g. defining lookup constructs to implement such “strong” functions like the Ackermann function.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "163152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163152", "title": "Freedom of information laws by country", "text": "Freedom of information laws by country\n\nFreedom of Information laws (FOI laws) allow access by the general public to data held by national governments. The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making. They establish a \"right-to-know\" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as open records, or sunshine laws (in the United States), governments are typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but these are usually unused if specific support legislation does not exist.\n\nOver 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of freedom of information legislation. Sweden's Freedom of the Press Act of 1766 is the oldest in the world.\n\nMost freedom of information laws exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction thus information held by the private sector cannot be accessed as a legal right. This limitation has serious implications because the private sector performs many functions which were previously the domain of the public sector. As a result, information that was previously public is now within the private sector, and the private contractors cannot be forced to disclose information.\n\nOther countries are working towards introducing such laws, and many regions of countries with national legislation have local laws. For example, all U.S. states have laws governing access to public documents belonging to the state and local taxing entities. Additionally, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act governs record management of documents in the possession of the federal government.\n\nA related concept is open meetings legislation, which allows access to government meetings, not just to the records of them. In many countries, privacy or data protection laws may be part of the freedom of information legislation; the concepts are often closely tied together in political discourse.\n\nA basic principle behind most freedom of information legislation is that the burden of proof falls on the body \"asked\" for information, not the person \"asking\" for it. The person making the request does not usually have to give an explanation for their actions, but if the information is not disclosed a valid reason has to be given.\n\nIn 2015 The UNESCO General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as “International Day for the Universal Access to Information” or, as it is more commonly known, Access to Information Day. The date had previously been celebrated as “Right to Know Day” since 2002. The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the UN General Assembly.\n\nIn Albania, the constitution of 1998 guarantees the right of access to information; the legislation for supporting this is Law no. 119/2014 \"On the right to information\" (Ligji nr. 119/2014 \"Për të drejtën e informimit\"). The law regulates the right of access to information being produced or held by public sector. The rules contained in this law are designated to ensure the public access to information, in the framework of assuming the rights and freedoms of the individual in practice, as well as establishing views on the state and society situation.This law aims also at encouraging integrity, transparency and accountability of the public sector bodies. Every person shall, where deemed that the rights provided for in this law have been violated, be entitled to file a complaint administratively to the Information and Data Protection Commissioner's Office. http://idp.al/index.php/sq/\n\nThe Law on Freedom of Information was unanimously approved by the Parliament on 23 September 2003 and went into force in November 2003.\n\nIn Australia, the Freedom of Information Act 1982 was passed at the federal level in 1982, applying to all \"ministers, departments and public authorities\" of the Commonwealth.\n\nThere is similar legislation in all states and territories:\n\nIn Azerbaijan, a Law on Access to Information was approved in 2005. It has gone into effect. Previously in 1998 there was accepted Law on Freedom on Information, but the Law of 2005 provided more detailed and secured regulation for access to official information.\n\nOn October 21, 2008, the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh issued in the Bangladesh Gazette the Right to Information Ordinance (No. 50 of 2008), based loosely on the Indian Right to Information Act, 2005. The Ordinance was passed by the current government of Bangladesh in the first session of this parliament on March 29, 2009. The A2i programme is a part of the Vision 2021, a political manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League party before winning the National Elections of 2008.\n\nArticle 32 of the Constitution was amended in 1993 to include a right of access to documents held by the government.\n\nIn Belize, the Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1998 was amended in 2000 and is currently in force, though a governmental commission noted that \"not much use has been made of the Act\".\n\nThe National Assembly of Bhutan passed an RTI Bill in February 2014. Its purpose is to curb corruption by providing the public with the right to access information.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was the first country in the Balkan region to adopt a Freedom of Information Act. Freedom of Access to Information Act or FOIA - was adopted by the Parliament Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 17 November 2000. Both federal entities - the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - passed freedom of information laws in 2001, the Freedom of Access to Information Act for the Republika Srpska and Freedom of Access to Information Act for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina respectively.\n\nThe FOIA Act changed on the BiH state level two times. The first alteration was passed in 2006, enabling stronger legal protection within the framework of administrative law of BiH. The second alteration was passed in December 2009, which enforced legal penalties for prescribed violations.\n\nIn Brazil, the Article 5, XXXIII, of the Constitution sets that \"everyone shall have the right to receive information of his own interest or of public interest from public entities, which shall be given within the time prescribed by law\". Also, article 22 of the Federal law nº 8.159/1991 grants the right to \"full access to public documents\".\nA statute passed in 2011 and that will enter into force in 2012 (Federal Law 12.527/2011, promulgated on 28 November 2011) regulates the manner and the timetable for the information to be given by the State.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the Access to Public Information Act was passed in 2000, following a 1996 recommendation from the Constitutional Court to implement such a law.\n\nIn Canada, the Access to Information Act allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the Pierre Trudeau government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response. This is enforced by the Information Commissioner of Canada.\n\nThere is also a complementary Privacy Act that was introduced in 1983. The purpose of the \"Privacy Act\" is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a Crown copyright. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.\n\nCanadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain personal information about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the \"Privacy Act\" but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the \"Access to Information Act\".\nEach province and territory in Canada has its own access to information legislation. In many cases, this is also the provincial public sector privacy legislation. For example:\n\nFrom 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the Coordination of Access to Information Requests System.\n\nA 393-page report released in September 2008, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compares Canada's Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations.\n\nIn 2009, The Walrus (magazine) published a detailed history of FOI in Canada.\n\nThe Freedom of Information Law was passed in 2007 and was brought into force in January 2009.\n\nIn Chile, article 8 of the Constitution provides for the freedom of information. A law titled Law on Access to Public Information (\"Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública\") took effect on April 20, 2009.\n\nIn April 2007, the State Council of the People's Republic of China promulgated the \"Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Open Government Information\" (中华人民共和国政府信息公开条例), which came into effect on May 1, 2008.\n\nThe Colombian constitution grants the right of access to public information through \"Law 57 of 1985\" which thereby mandates the publishing of acts and official documents. This is implemented and applies to documents that belong to official facilities (offices or the like). Additionally there is the anti corruption statement of \"Law 190 of 1955\" also known as \"anti corruption act\" which in its 51st article mandates public offices to list in visible area all the contracts and purchases made by month. The latter taking place slowly. A more modern law, the \"Ley de transparencia y del derecho de acceso a la información pública nacional\" its at its final stages.\n\nArticle 23 of the constitution states that \"Every person has the right to present petitions to the authorities for the general or private interest and to secure their prompt resolution. The legislative body may regulate the presentation of petitions to private organisations in order to guarantee fundamental rights.\"\n\nThis article justifies the existence of a jurisdictional mechanism known a petition action. This action is regulated by the law 1755 of 2015 and is considered by the Colombian Judicial Doctrine as a fundamental human right. According to the law all petitions should be fully addressed in 15 business days. If not addressed the official in charge of resolving the petition may be charged with misconduct.\n\nAccess to official information is governed by the Official Information Act 2008. The law is based heavily on the New Zealand legislation.\n\nIn Croatia, the Zakon o pravu na pristup informacijama (\"Act on the Right of Access to Information\") of 2003 extends to all public authorities.\n\nThe right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on freedom of expression. The No. 184(I)/2017 law on access to information in the southern part of the Republic of Cyprus of the country has been published on 22 December 2017. A law that falls below Council of Europe standards in the Northern occupied part of Cyprus. The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is de facto divided.\n\nAs to 2011, a research by the Open Cyprus Project showed that there was a level of 75% of administrative silence island-wide, in response to information requests. Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.\n\nSince late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information was being discussed in the Parliament of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nOn 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017 Law on the Right of Access to Information of the Public Sector).\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the Zákon č. 106/1999 Sb., o svobodném přístupu k informacím (\"Act No. 106/1999 Coll. on Free Access to Information\") covers the \"state agencies, territorial self-administration authorities and public institutions managing public funds\" as well as any body authorised by the law to reach legal decisions relating to the public sector, to the extent of such authorisation.\n\nAccess to Public Administration Files Act of 1985 is a Danish act passed by the Folketing concerning public access to governmental records. The Act came into force in 1987 and repealed the Public Records Act of 1970. New version of the Act came into force on 1 January 2014. Denmark is considered to be a historic pioneer in the field of FOI along with Sweden, Finland and Norway.\nThere is no constitutional basis in the Constitution of Denmark for the right of the public to information. Denmark scores 64 points in Global Right to Information Rating.\n\nAccording to the Act of 1985, Section 4 Part 1 “any person may ask to see documents received or issued by an administrative authority.” Information concerning administrative matters of the public administration; electricity and heating utilities as well as private bodies receiving public funding or performing public function can be acquired. Yet, the information concerning activities of judicial branch and legislators is not accessible.\n\nReasons do not have to be given while making a request; however, the authorities can ask for additional information regarding document. The requests are supposed to be handled as soon as possible; if within period of 10 days response to an application was not provided, the authority has to inform on reasons for the delay as well as expected date for a decision. More detailed procedures are not laid down in the Act.\n\nAccess to information is limited by “the obligation to maintain secrecy.” Considerations of State security, defence, foreign policy, external economic interests as well as public financial interests can limit the granting of access to the information.\nRegisters and records processed electronically are excluded from the administrative documents that can be given access to. Section 10 outlines other areas excluded from access, such as records of meetings of the Council of State, minutes, as well as documents prepared for such meetings; correspondence between ministries concerning legislation and material used for scientific research or public statistics.\n\nDecision to grant or not to grant access can be appealed. Decisions can also be appealed externally to Folketingets Ombudsman. Ombudsman can also deliver opinions and review decisions; however, these are not binding even though generally followed. Ombudsman receives 200-300 complaints annually; approximately 15 percent of complaints are ruled in favour of appellants.\n\nThe exemption regarding EU documents was taken out of the Act in 1991. Amendments were also made in 2000; they concerned data on the employees of the Government. In January 2014 new Public Records Act was enforced. The new act was highly debated since it was considered to limit transparency in the Government and legislative proceedings; Denmark received one point less in the category of Political Environment when compared with the Freedom of the Press report of 2015. The new legislation caused demonstrations and protests. It can be regarded as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. After the Public Records Act of 2013 came into effect, public access to information regarding the Intelligence Services instead of falling under the Public Records Act is now managed by the Act on the Security and Intelligence Service as well as the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service. In addition, the access to legislative process was further restricted. According to the new Act documents in the drafting stage are not to be accessed as well as “other corresponding political activities,” so restriction is not concerning only Bills. In the future, it will not be possible to find the calendars of ministers being published. Nevertheless, the Act was created while keeping in mind the strengthening the project of the Open Government; the list of institutions covered by the Act was extended as well as list of public-private institutions and companies.\n\nHipólito Mejía approved Ley No.200-04 - Ley General de Libre Acceso a la Información Pública (\"Law number 200-04 - Law on Access to Information\") on 28 July 2004, which allows public access to information from the government and private organisations that receive public money to conduct state business. Rough drafts and projects that are not part of an administrative procedure are not included.\n\nIn Ecuador, the Transparency and Access to Information Law of 2004 declares that the right of access to information is guaranteed by the state.\n\nIn El Salvador, the Law on Access to Public Information was given assent by The Legislative Assembly of El Salvador on 3 March 2011.\n\nIn Estonia, the Public Information Act of 2000 extends to all \"holders of information\", which is clarified as being all government and local government bodies, legal persons in public law and legal persons in private law if they are performing public duties (providing health, education etc.).\n\nIn matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment, the Aarhus convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice in governmental decision-making processes. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.\n\nThe recognition of the right to access to public information under Article 10 (including \"freedom (..) to receive (..) information\") of the European Convention on Human Rights was one of subjects in \"Guerra v. Italy\" case before the European Court of Human Rights in 1998. The majority considered Article 10 was not applicable to the complaint. However, the court found that in the specific case, which included living near a high-risk factory, not providing information was in violation of Article 8 (respect to private and family life). Besides, two judges expressed a dissent on applicability of Article 10, and further six judges reserved a possibility, that in other circumstances, right to access to information could be protected by Article 10.\n\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has considered in 1996, that \"public access to clear and full information on this subject [Chernobyl disaster]—and many others for that matter—must be viewed as a basic human right\". In 2009, CoE Convention on Access to Official Documents was opened for signature.\n\nArticle 42 CFR and Article 15 TFEU give ″[a]ny citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, [...] a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium.\" It follows from Article 15 TFEU that this right is \"subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined\" in legislation.\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents further defines this right of access to documents of the three institutions; for most other EU bodies and agencies, there is a provision in the legal act establishing them which makes Regulation No 1049/2001 applicable to them as well. In some other cases, specific rules apply (e.g. to the EESC, the CoR, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the ECB). \"Document\" is defined broadly and it is assumed that all documents, even if classified, may be subject to right of access unless it falls under one of the exceptions. If access is refused, the applicant is allowed a confirmatory request. A complaint against a refusal can be made with the European Ombudsman and/or an appeal can be brought before the European General Court.\n\nIn addition, Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information sets out the rules and practices for accessing public sector information resources for further exploitation. This directive has been reviewed in 2013 by Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information\n\nSince 2008, the European Commission operates the Register of Interest representatives, a voluntary register of lobbyists at the European union.\n\nDirective 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and Council provides for citizens of each country to have freedom of access to information on the environment, in line with the requirements of the Aarhus Convention. Governments are required to transcribe the directive into national legislation (for example, in the United Kingdom, the Environmental Information Regulations 2004).\n\nDirective 95/46/EC, the Data Protection directive, provides a variety of rights in relation to personal data, including a right of access. This has been transcribed into national legislation through, for example, the Data Protection Act 1998 (United Kingdom) and the Data Protection 2003 (Ireland).\n\nIn Finland, the Laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta 9.2.1951/83 (\"Act on the Openness of Public Documents\" of 1951) established the openness of all records and documents in the possession of officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta 21.5.1999/621 (\"Act on the Openness of Government Activities\" of 1999), called in short \"Publicity Act\" () also extended the principle of openness to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.\n\nThe Publicity Act establishes a process by which any person may access any record in possession of an authority. The person may ask the authority for the document in person or in writing. When making the request, the requester needs to specify the document so that it can be identified. However, the authority is liable to assist the person with its document registers and indices in this task. After receiving the request, the authority has two weeks to give the document. If the decision is negative, and document is withheld, the requester may appeal to the administrative court. The document may be given orally, for reading and copying in the authority's premises or as an electronic or paper copy, as requested by the person. However, the copying may be declined if it would be unfeasible because of the large number of documents or otherwise technically difficult. There are also a number of limitations on the release of electronic documents designed for the protection of the individual privacy.\n\nThe reasons for withholding a document are listed in the article 24 of the Act. They may be grouped to three categories: automatic non-openness, conditional non openness or conditional openness. The documents where automatic non-openness is prescribed remain withheld in all cases. In the case of conditional non-openness, the reasonability of the non-openness is reviewed case-by-case by the authority and, if appeals are made, by the court. In the third category, openness is a rule, and the reason for non-openness needs to be established by the authority.\n\nThe absolute reasons for non-openness are (subpoint of Article 24 in captions)\n\nConditional non-openness is mandated for the following categories of documents, unless it is \"obviously clear\" that the protected interest is not endangered\n\nConditional openness is prescribed for the following categories of information:\n\nNon-open information remains non-open for 25 years after it was created or obtained by an authority. Documents that are non-open to protect the privacy of an individual remain non-open for 50 years after the protected individual has died.\n\nIf information is still, after 25 years, valid and describes a security measure of a building, facility, system or method or it is still part of a plan used for national defence or civil defence, it remains non-open as long as the information is pertinent for the purpose. The same indefinite non-openness applies to all documents under international security obligations, if the release might still affect Finnish foreign relations negatively. The non-openness of other documents may be prolonged up to 55 years by the Council of State, if necessary to safeguard a protected interest.\n\nIn France, the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the \"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen\".\n\nThe implementing legislation is the Loi n°78-753 du 17 juillet 1978 portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal (\"Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature\"). It sets as a general rule that citizens can demand a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitised or other form), and establishes the \"Commission d’Accès aux Documents Administratifs\", an independent administrative authority, to oversee the process.\n\nIn Georgia, the General Administrative Code contains a Law on Freedom of Information.\n\nIn Germany, the federal government passed a freedom of information law on September 5, 2005; it was last updated on August 7, 2013. The law grants each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. No legal, commercial, or any other kind of justification is necessary.\n\nTwelve of the sixteen Bundesländer—Baden-Württemberg, Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Rheinland-Pfalz, Saarland, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein and Thüringen—have approved individual \"Informationsfreiheitsgesetze\" (Freedom of Information laws).\n\nIn Greece, the 1975 Greek Constitution guaranteed the right of access to administrative documents and the right of citizens to obtain information. However it was not until 1986 that the first law was passed to provide for access to information.\n\nArticle 16 (Right to Access Administrative Documents—Δικαίωμα γνώσης διοικητικών εγγράφων) of Law 1599/1986 (State-citizenry Relationship—Σχέσεις Κράτους-πολίτη) introduced the right of all citizens to read most administrative documents. This right is now codified as article 5 (Access to documents—Πρόσβαση σε έγγραφα) of the Administrative Procedural Code (Κώδικας Διοικητικής Διαδικασίας), Law 2690/1999. Under this article, citizens have a right to know the content of administrative documents. Administrative documents are defined as those produced by public sector entities, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, instructions, responses, consultatory responses, and decisions. In addition, citizens with a legitimate interest may also access \"private\" documents stored by public services. The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document's confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.\n\nCitizens may study the documents at the place where they are archived, or they may obtain a copy at their own cost. Access to one's own medical data is provided with the help of a doctor. Access to documents should take into account whether they be covered by copyright, patent, or trade secret regulations.\n\nIn addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the European Union Directive 2003/98/EC.\n\nIn Hong Kong there are no laws specifically enacted to guarantee the freedom of information.\n\nSince March 1995, the Government of Hong Kong has promulgated a \"Code on Access to Information\" to serve a similar purpose. This code, like other internal regulations of the Government, was not legislated by the Legislative Council and has a minimal legal status. It requires government agencies listed in its appendix to appoint Access to Information Officers to answer citizens' requests for governmental records. A fee may be charged prior to the release of information. The code does not require the government to archive information.\n\nIn Hungary, the Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Public Access to Data of Public Interest of 1992 extends a right of access to all data of public interest, defined as any information processed by a body performing a governmental function. Complaints and contested applications may be appealed to the Data Protection Commissioner or to the court.\n\nIn 2005 the Parliament adopted the Act on the Freedom of Information by Electronic Means (Act XC of 2005). The Act has three basic parts: 1. electronic disclousure of certain data by public sector bodies, 2. publicity of legislation and 3. openness of Court decisions.\n\nIn Iceland the Information Act (Upplysingalög) Act no. 50/1996 gives access to public information.\n\nThe Right to Information Act (RTI Act) was passed by Parliament on 11 May 2005 and was published in the gazette of India on 15 June 2005. It came into effect on 12 October 2005 replacing the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court of India had, in several Judgments prior to enactment of both Acts, interpreted Indian Constitution to read Right to Information as the Fundamental Right as embodied in Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and also in Right to Life. RTI Act laid down a procedure to guarantee this right. Under this law all Government Bodies or Government funded agencies have to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO). The PIO's responsibility is to ensure that information requested is disclosed to the petitioner within 30 days or within 48 hours in case of information concerning the life or liberty of a person. The law was inspired by previous legislation from select states (among them Tamil Nadu (1997), Goa (1997), Rajasthan (2000), Karnataka (2000), Delhi (2001), Maharashtra (2002) etc.) that allowed the right to information (to different degrees) to citizens about activities of any State Government body.\n\nA number of high-profile disclosures revealed corruption in various government schemes such scams in Public Distribution Systems (ration stores), disaster relief, construction of highways etc. The law itself has been hailed as a landmark in India's drive towards more openness and accountability.\n\nHowever the RTI India has certain weaknesses that hamper implementation.\n\nRTI NEWS\n\nOn International Right to Information Day 1000 Copies of The RTI Act Sent by Mr. Naveen Agrawal in India\n\nNagpur (Dt.28/10/2018). 28 September is observed as International Right to Information Day across the world. Mr. Naveen Maheshkumar Agrawal, Registrar, Dada Ramchand Bakhru Sindhu Mahavidyalaya, with a view to creating awareness about the Right to Information Act, 2005 in society sent the soft copies of the RTI Act to 1000 people on International Right to Information Day. It was indeed a novel way on his part to spread awareness about the Act. The copies of the Act were sent in English, Hindi and Marathi languages. Introducing transparency in the government work is the main purpose of this Act. But even to the lack of awareness in information seeker and information provider, the effective implementation of the said act is badly affected. In 2017 also Mr. Naveen Agrawal had sent 101 applications under RTI Act 2005 to different public authorities seeking information on different issues on International Day of Right to Information with the purpose of creating awareness about the Act.\n\nThe Law on Dissemination of and Free Access to Information was approved by Iranian Parliament in 2008. Its English and Arabic renditions were officially released as part of the government's efforts to promote Freedom of Information (FOI) in October 2018.\n\nIn Ireland the Freedom of Information Act 1997 came into effect in April, 1998. This provided for members of the public to access information specifically about themselves, amend incorrect information, and request an explanation behind administrative decisions concerning themselves, as well as allowing any person to access records generated by a list of specified public bodies. The Act is seen as having led to a sea-change in the relationship between the citizen, journalists, government departments and public bodies. Disclosure is the default assumption of the Act; bodies can withhold information only by citing exemptions specified in the legislation. Decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for information may be reviewed by the Information Commissioner.\n\nThe Act was subsequently amended by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. The amendments introduced fees for non-personal requests and restricted the kinds of material which could be accessed.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, the Freedom of Information Act 2014 repealed the 1997 and 2003 Acts, removing most of the restrictions introduced in 2003 and widened the range of bodies covered to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allowed for the Government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant public funds, so that the FOI legislation applies to them also.\n\nOne particular controversy which has caused concern to journalists and historians is that traditionally government ministers would annotate and sign any major policy or report documents which they had seen. However this practice has fallen out of favour because of the new openness. This annotation and signing of documents has often given a paper trail and unique insight as to \"what the minister knew\" about a controversy or how he or she formed an opinion on a matter. Also civil and public servants have become more informal, in keeping written records of potentially controversial meeting and avoiding writing memos as a result. While this information would not often be released, and sometimes only under the thirty year rule, the fact that government ministers now do not annotate and sign documents creates the concerns that while government is open it is not accountable as to who did or saw what or how decision making process works.\n\nIn Israel, the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998, supported by the Freedom of Information Regulations, 5759-1999, controls freedom of information. It defines the bodies subject to the legislation by a set of listed categories - essentially, most public bodies - and provides for the government to publish a list of all affected bodies. However, this list does not seem to have been made publicly available, if indeed it was ever compiled. Many public bodies are not obliged to follow the law, which limits the potential for use by the public.\n\nThe Israeli Freedom of Information Law has, in some cases, actually achieved the opposite intended result. some Government agencies now take the position that a citizen may only request information via FOIL—i.e., an official letter designated as such and including the 95 shekel fee. Thus an Israeli citizen in many cases cannot simply write a letter asking a question, and can be asked to file a FOIL application with a fee and wait the minimum statutory 30 days for a reply, which the agency can extend to 60 days. In many cases FOIL letters are simply ignored, or some laconic response is sent stating the request is either unclear, unspecific, too vague or some other legalese, anything in order to keep the information away from the public. When the 60 days are up, if the anticipated result usually yield nothing significant, the applicant must petition the District Court to compel disclosure, a procedure that requires attorneys to draft pleadings and a payment of (approximately) $420 court fee. A judgement in such FOIL appeals in Israel can take many months, and again the agency can easily avoid disclosure by simply not complying, although risking being charged with contempt of court. While there are some successes in courts compelling Israeli government agencies to disclose information, they are usually in non-controversial areas. The law provides for the expected \"security\" exemption and an applicant applying for such information can expect not to benefit from FOIL (and also have his or her court appeal rejected). it will be noted that Applicants can sometimes be helped by The Movement for Freedom of Information.\n\nChapter V of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 provides for access to administrative documents. However, the right to access is limited. The law states that those requesting information must have a legal interest. The 1992 regulations require \"a personal concrete interest to safeguard in legally relevant situations.\" The courts have ruled that this includes the right of environmental groups and local councilors to demand information on behalf of those they represent. It was amended in 2005. The revision appears to adopt the court rulings and relax the interest somewhat to allow access when an individual can show they represent a more general public interest.\n\nIn Jamaica, the relevant legislation is the Access to Information Act, 2002.\n\nIn Japan, the \"Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs\" (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律) was promulgated in 1999. The law was enforced in 2001.\n\nIn many local governments, it establishes the regulations about information disclosure (情報公開条例) from the latter half of the 1980s.\n\nThe Constitution of Latvia states: \"Article 100. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to freely receive, keep and distribute information and to express his or her views. Censorship is prohibited.\" The right to access state held information has been repeatedly recognised by the Constitutional Court of Latvia, most notably in its judgment \"On Conformity of the Cabinet of Ministers 21 January 1997 Regulations No.46 \"On Government Agreements\" with the 20 November 1998 \"Information Accessibility Law\"\n\nThe Law on Freedom of Information was signed into law by the State President in November 1998 and has been amended a number of times recently. Any person can ask for information in \"any technically feasible form\" without having to show a reason. The request can be oral or written. Bodies must respond in 15 days.\n\nOn the 1st of September 2012, Legal Notice 156 of 2012 brought the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 496 of the Laws of Malta) fully into force, allowing the public (resident citizens of Malta, the EU and the EEA) to submit requests for documents/information held by the Government. FOI requests are submitted free of charge but processing of documents by public authorities may require the public to pay fees which never exceed Eur 40. When access to documents is refused, the FOIA in Malta provides for a complaint and appeal mechanism that can be ultimately resolved through the Courts of Appeal.\n\nPresident Ellen Johnson Sirleaf signed the Freedom of Information Act of 2010 into law in October 2010. Liberia became only the fourth country in Africa, and the first in West Africa, to pass such legislation. The law allows both the media and individual citizens to demand information from any public authority or any private authority that carries out government functions.\n\nArticle 16 of the Constitution of Macedonia guarantees \"access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information\".\n\nThe Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006. It is scheduled to go into force in September 2006.The law allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from state and municipal bodies and natural and legal persons who are performing public functions. The requests can be oral, written or electronic. Requests must be responded to in 10 days.\n\nThe state of Selangor passed the Freedom of Information Enactment (Selangor) 2010 on 1 April 2011, allowing the Malaysian public an access to the state documents including that of local councils, city halls and state government-linked companies. Subsequently, the state of Penang passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the public to access to state documents. Both states are under the ruling of the federal opposition Pakatan Rakyat.\n\nThe Maldives passed the Right to Information Act (RTI) on January 12, 2014.\n\nThe Constitution was amended in 1977 to include a right of freedom of information. Article 6 says in part, \"the right of information shall be guaranteed by the state.\" The Supreme Court made a number of decisions further enhancing that right.\n\nThe Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information was unanimously approved by Congress in April 2002 and signed by President Fox in June 2002. It went into effect in June 2003.\n\nA freedom of information law was passed in Montenegro late in 2005, after a process of several years.\n\nArticle 110 of the Constitution states: \"In the exercise of their duties government bodies shall observe the principle of transparency in accordance with the rules to be prescribed by Act of Parliament.\"\n\nThe Dutch act on public access to government information entered into force in 1980 and is updated several times later. Under the act known as the \"\", or \"Wob\" for short, any person can demand information (called \"wobbing\") related to an administrative matter if it is contained in documents held by public authorities or companies carrying out work for a public authority. The request can either be written or oral. The authority has two (on environmental issues) or four weeks to respond. The act also obliges the government to provide information \"unsolicited\" as it is in the interest of good and democratic governance.\n\nIn New Zealand, the relevant legislation is the Official Information Act 1982. This implemented a general policy of openness regarding official documents and replaced the Official Secrets Act.\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan signed into law the Freedom of Information (FoI) Bill, awaited for 12 years by media proprietors and practitioners alike, during which the Villa got knocks for filibustering and lawmakers complained of bombardment by campaigners.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed the Bill on February 24, 2011 and the Senate dialled up integrity on March 16 as it delivered on promise to pass it.\n\nThe harmonised version was passed by both Chambers on May 26, 2011.It was conveyed to Jonathan on May 27, and he signed it on May 28, 2011, according to a statement Aso Rock issued on Tuesday.\n\nTwo states in Nigeria (namely Ekiti and Lagos State) have adopted the Freedom of Information Act at State level but they have extended the response date at State level from 7 days to 14 days. More states are expected to adopt the bill and come up with their own version.\n\nThe current freedom of information legislation was enacted May 19. 2006, and superseded the previous law of 1970 by January 1, 2009. Article 100 of the Constitution gives access to public documents. The basic principle of the law is everyone has the right to access to State and municipal documents and to be present at sittings of courts and elected assemblies.\n\nPresident Pervez Musharraf promulgated the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002 in October 2002. The law allows any citizen access to public records held by a public body of the federal government including ministries, departments, boards, councils, courts and tribunals. It does not apply to government owned corporations or provincial governments. The bodies must respond within 21 days.\n\nMore recently, by virtue of the 18th Amendment of 2010, article 19A has been inserted in the Constitution of Pakistan. It gives the right to access to information the status of a fundamental constitutional right. Article 19A \"Right to Information\" reads: \"Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law\".\n\nThe National Constitution of Paraguay enacted in 1992, guarantees the right to be informed and to receive true, responsible, and equitable information (Art. 28). The same article states that public sources of information are free, and that a law will regulate the modalities, time periods, and sanctions “in order to make this right effective”. In practice, this last provision delayed the recognition of the right due to the absence of a law making it “effective”. Congress, government agencies and Courts were reluctant to enforce the right to access public sources of information until 2013. A Supreme Court judgment (No. 1306 of 15 October 2013), marked the beginning of what has been called a “Transparency Spring”.\n\nThe ruling from the Supreme Court was made in the context of an Amparo filed by a citizen called Jose Daniel Vargas Tellez, after the San Lorenzo Municipality denied him access to the information about the names, the job descriptions and the wages of all the employees that were working in that public office. The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals rejected the Amparo on the grounds that information of that type was considered sensitive by the Data Protection and Privacy Act (Law 1682/02 and 1969/02). The latter rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Vargas Tellez holding that while this information relating to the identity and wages of public employees and officers constitutes personal propriety data, it is nonetheless registered in a “public source of information”, which makes it available to any citizen who requests it. The right to access to these informations is recognised under the Constitution and international instruments such as the American Convention on Human Rights (Art. 13); The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Art. 19); and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (Art. 13).\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's decision, and with the support of the civil society and President Horacio Cartes, the first Transparency law was enacted (Law No. 5189/14) requiring all public offices to disclose information regarding the use of public funds to pay salaries. In addition, The Freedom of Information and Government Transparency Law (Law 5282/2014) was enacted in 2014 and a final regulation of 2015 (Executive Decree 4064/15) set the final step in the road to Transparency. These rules expressly recognize that the right to access public information is a human right, which improves the State, promotes citizen participation and public accountability, and serves as a tool to combat corruption. Currently, all requests to access public information can be done online through a single portal, and government offices are obliged to respond within 15 days.\n\nParaguay became internationally committed to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance after becoming a member of the Open Government Partnership. Presently, most government offices have Transparency offices and can provide information to citizens and receive reports of corruption. The main Executive agency in charge of promoting Electronic Government is the SENATICS.\n\nRectification, Clarification and Destruction of False or Distorted information:\n\nArt 28 of the Constitution also states that any person affected by the diffusion of a false, distorted, or ambiguous information has the right to demand its rectification or its clarification by the same means and under the same conditions in which it was divulged, without prejudice to the other compensatory rights. There is also a specific law that regulates Habeas Data, and any citizen can request a copy of publicly or privately held information relating to him, and can demand that any inaccurate data found be destroyed.\n\nOn July 23, 2016, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte signed the executive order on freedom of information to be implemented effectively in all offices under the executive branch of government.\n\nSection 13(4) of the Constitution of the Pitcairn Islands provides that \"Freedom of information in Pitcairn shall be provided by Ordinance, which shall reflect the freedom of information legislation of the United Kingdom adapted to the circumstances of Pitcairn\".\n\nThe \"Freedom of Information Ordinance 2012\" implements this requirement.\n\nArticle 61 of the Constitution provides for the right to information and mandates that Parliament enact a law setting out this right.\n\nThe Law on Access to Public Information was approved in September 2001 and went into effect in January 2002. The Act allows anyone to demand access to public information, public data and public assets held by public bodies, private bodies that exercise public tasks, trade unions and political parties. The requests can be oral or written. The bodies must respond within 14 days.\n\nArticle 34 of the Constitution provides for a right of access to information.\n\nThe Law of the Republic of Moldova on Access to Information was approved by Parliament in May 2000 and went into force in August 2000. Under the law, citizens and residents of Moldova can demand information from state institutions, organisations financed by the public budget and individuals and legal entities that provide public services and hold official information.\n\nSince 2001 there is one law on Freedom of Information and one on transparent decision making processes in public\nadministration (a sunshine law).\n\nThe law Relating to Access to Information was passed on the 08/02/2013. It puts forth the purpose of the law, recognises the right to access to information, the procedures for accessing information, and compliance related issues.available at http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/postoftheday/2013/18/Rwanda_ATI_Law_March2013_NewDelhi_SatbirS.pdf\n\nIn Serbia, the Access to Public Information Act gives access to documents of public authorities.\n\nSlovakia passed the Freedom of Information Act in May 2000 (Num. law: 211/2000 Z. z.). Under the law, everybody can demand information from state institutions, organisations, from municipalities, individuals and legal entities financed by the public budget.\n\nSlovenia passed the Access to Public Information Act in March 2003. The Act governs the procedure which ensures everyone free access to public information held by state bodies, local government bodies, public agencies, public funds and other entities of public law, public powers holders and public service contractors.\n\nSection 32 of the Constitution of South Africa guarantees \"the right of access to any information held by the state; and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights.\" This right is implemented through the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which was enacted on 2 February 2000. The right of access to \"privately\" held information is an interesting feature, as most freedom of information laws only cover governmental bodies.\n\nThe Constitutional Court ruled in 1989 that there is a constitutional right to information \"as an aspect of the right of freedom of expression and specific implementing legislation to define the contours of the right was not a prerequisite to its enforcement.\"\n\nThe Act on Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in January 1998. It allows citizens to demand information held by public agencies.\n\nSri Lanka's Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 was certified on 4 August 2016. After much debate and many amendments to the draft Bill, the final Act comprising 44 Sections was certified in early August 2016. The implementation of the Act is expected to take time due to the necessity of establishing cadre positions in government institutions to provide information to the general public. The Act is considered to hold many strengths and positive features that would effectively authorize citizens to be actively involved in the process of governance. Moreover, Article 14A(1) introduced by virtue of 19th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka has paved the way for the recognition of right to information as a fundamental right.\n\nIn Sweden, the Freedom of the Press Act grants public access to official documents and is included in the Constitution of Sweden. Dating back to 1766, it is the first freedom of information legislation in the modern sense. In modern times the right has become known as the Principle of Public Access (Swedish: \"offentlighetsprincipen\").\n\nThe Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the Riksdag.\n\nSwitzerland is a federal state. Access to federal documents is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in Public Administration, and supervised by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. Access to documents at the cantonal level is governed by cantonal laws, which are mostly similar to the federal law.\nAs of 2018, the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden, Glarus, Lucerne, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Thurgau do not have freedom of information legislation.\n\nThe \"Freedom of Government Information Law\" (政府資訊公開法), enacted by the Legislative Yuan of the ROC government in Taiwan, has been in force since 28 December 2005.\n\nTanzania's Access to Information Act was passed in 2016.\n\nIn Thailand, the relevant legislation is the Official Information Act of 1997.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the relevant legislation is the Freedom of Information Act, 1999.\n\nIn Turkey, the Turkish Law on the Right to Information (Bilgi Edinme Hakkı Kanunu) was signed on October 24, 2003 and it came into effect 6 months later on April 24, 2004.\n\nIn Uganda, the Access to Information Act (ATI) was approved in 2005 but its regulations were not passed until 2011. The laws states that citizen and especially journalists can demand accountability from a government official. The Hub for Investigative Media (HIM) in Uganda offers training programs that teaches East-African journalists in matters of fact-checking and digital security. HIM also has made government officials are of the ATI law and its provision. They have also conducted a nationwide campaign to train journalists on the knowledge and application of the ATI laws as right holders.\n\nThe 1996 Constitution does not include a specific general right of access to information but contains a general right of freedom of collect and disseminate information and rights of access to personal and environmental information.\n\nThe Art. 5 of The Law on Information of 1992 (revised in 2011) provides the term «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests.\n\nLaw on Access to Public Information was adopted 13 January 2011 and go into force from 9 May 2011. It widens the range of subjects, obliged to provide information, gives legislative definition of public information and makes public information accessible with statutory restrictions.\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act 2000 (2000 c. 36) is the implementation of freedom of information legislation in the United Kingdom on a national level, with the exception of Scottish bodies, which are covered by the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (2002 asp. 13). Environmental information is covered by further legislation Environmental Information Regulations 2004. Tony Blair, the UK Prime Minister who introduced the Freedom of Information Act, later expressed regret over the Act, claiming that the Act impeded the ability of officials to deliberate \"with a reasonable level of confidentiality\".\n\nIn the United States the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 4, 1966 and went into effect the following year. Ralph Nader has been credited with the impetus for creating this act, among others. The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments were signed by President Bill Clinton on October 2, 1996.\n\nThe Act applies only to federal agencies. However, all of the states, as well as the District of Columbia and some territories, have enacted similar statutes to require disclosures by agencies of the state and of local governments, though some are significantly broader than others. Some state and local government agencies attempt to get around state open records laws by claiming copyright for their works and then demanding high fees to license the public information. Some states expand government transparency through open meeting laws, which require government meetings to be announced in advance and held publicly.\n\nThe Act was enacted in 2008 under President Vazquez's Administration and is mainly implemented by the Judiciary.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIPPA) was signed by their President Robert Mugabe in February 2002.\n\n\n(Unless stated otherwise, information is current as of July 2008).\n\n\nPeople\n\nInternational:\n\nEurope:\n\nBrazil:\n\nIndia:\n\nTurkey:\n\nUnited States:\n\nNepal\n\nOpen Meetings:\nSouth Korea:\n"}

{"id": "32087292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32087292", "title": "Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)", "text": "Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)\n\nThe concept of a Garden of the gods or a divine paradise might be of Sumerian origin, or so it is argued by Samuel Noah Kramer. The concept of this home of the immortals was later handed down to the Babylonians who conquered Sumer.\n\nA Sumerian paradise is usually associated with the Dilmun civilization of Eastern Arabia. Sir Henry Rawlinson first suggested the geographical location of Dilmun was in Bahrain in 1880. This theory was later promoted by Frederich Delitzsch in his book \"Wo lag das Paradies\" in 1881, suggesting that it was at the head of the Persian Gulf. Various other theories have been put forward on this theme. Dilmun is first mentioned in association with Kur (mountain) and this is particularly problematic as Bahrain is very flat, having a highest prominence of only elevation. Also, in the early epic \"Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta\", the construction of the ziggurats in Uruk and Eridu are described as taking place in a world \"before Dilmun had yet been settled\". In 1987, Theresa Howard-Carter realized that the locations in this area possess no archaeological evidence of a settlement dating 3300-2300 BC. She proposed that Dilmun could have existed in different eras and the one of this era might be a still unidentified tell.\n\nIn tablet nine of the standard version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh travels to the garden of the gods through the Cedar Forest and the depths of Mashu, a comparable location in Sumerian version is the \"Mountain of cedar-felling\". Little description remains of the \"jewelled garden\" of Gilgamesh because twenty four lines of the myth were damaged and could not be translated at that point in the text.\n\nBohl has highlighted that the word \"Mashu\" in Sumerian means \"twins\". Jensen and Zimmern thought it to be the geographical location between Mount Lebanon and Mount Hermon in the Anti-Lebanon range. Edward Lipinski and Peter Kyle McCarter have suggested that the garden of the gods relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges. Other scholars have found a connection between the Cedars of Lebanon and the garden of the gods. The location of garden of the gods is close to the forest, which is described in the line:\n\nTheophilus Pinches suggested in 1908 that Eridu was the Sumerian paradise calling it \"not the earthly city of that name, but a city conceived as lying also \"within the Abyss\", containing a tree of life fed by the Euphrates river. Pinches noted \"it was represented as a place to which access was forbidden, for 'no man entered its midst', as in the case of the garden of Eden after the fall.\" In a myth called the \"Incantation of Eridu\", it is described as having a \"glorious fountain of the abyss\", a \"house of wisdom\", sacred grove and a \"kiskanu\"-tree with the appearance of lapis-lazuli. Fuʼād Safar also found the remains of a canal running through Eridu in archaeological excavations of 1948 to 1949. William Foxwell Albright noted that \"Eridu is employed as a name of the Abzu, just as Kutu (Kutha), the city of Nergal, is a common name of Aralu\" highlighting the problems in translation where several places were called the same name. Alfred Jeremias suggested that Aralu was the same as Ariel in the West Bank and signified both the mountain of the gods and a place of desolation. As with the word Ekur, this has suggested that ideas associated with the netherworld came from a mountainous country outside of Babylonia.\n\nThe myth of Enlil and Ninlil opens with a description of the city of Nippur, its walls, river, canals and well, portrayed as the home of the gods and, according to Kramer \"that seems to be conceived as having existed before the creation of man.\" Andrew R. George suggests \"Nippur was a city inhabited by gods not men, and this would suggest that it had existed from the very beginning.\" He discusses Nippur as the \"first city\" (uru-sag, \"\"City-top (head)\") of Sumer. This conception of Nippur is echoed by Joan Goodnick Westenholz, describing the setting as \"civitas dei\", existing before the \"axis mundi\".\n\nGeorge also noted that a ritual garden was re-created in the \"Grand Garden of Nippur, most probably a sacred garden in the E-kur (or Dur-an-ki) temple complex, is described in a cult-song of Enlil as a \"garden of heavenly joy\". Temples in Mesopotamia were also known to have adorned their ziggurats with a sanctuary and sacred grove of trees, reminiscent of the Hanging gardens of Babylon.\n\nIn the \"Kesh temple hymn\", the first recorded description (c. 2600 BC) of a domain of the gods is described as being the color of a garden: \"The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden.\" In an earlier translation of this myth by George Aaron Barton in \"Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions\" he considered it to read \"In hursag the garden of the gods was green.\"\n\nAnother Sumerian creation myth, the \"Debate between sheep and grain\" opens with a location \"the hill of heaven and earth\", and describes various agricultural developments in a pastoral setting. This is discussed by Edward Chiera as \"not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian Garden of Eden is to be placed.\" The Sumerian word Edin, means \"steppe\" or \"plain\", so modern scholarship has abandoned the use of the phrase \"Babylonian Garden of Eden\" as it has become clear the \"Garden of Eden\" was a later concept.\n\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" describes Gilgamesh travelling to a wondrous garden of the gods that is the source of a river, next to a mountain covered in cedars, and references a \"plant of life\". In the myth, paradise is identified as the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, Utnapishtim (Ziusudra), was taken by the gods to live forever. Once in the garden of the gods, Gilgamesh finds all sorts of precious stones, similar to :\n\nThe myth of \"Enki and Ninhursag\" also describes the Sumerian paradise as a garden, which Enki obtains water from Utu to irrigate.\n\nThe \"song of the hoe\" features Enlil creating mankind with a hoe and the Anunnaki spreading outward from the original garden of the gods. It also mentions the Abzu being built in Eridu.\n\nA \"Hymn to Enlil\" praises the leader of the Sumerian pantheon in the following terms:\n\nThe word for Paradise garden in much later Persian literature is \"apiri-Daeza\", meaning \"garden\" or \"walled enclosure\" or \"orchard\". The Arabic word for paradise or garden in the Qur'an is Jannah which literally means \"concealed place\". Two watercourses are supposed to flow underneath the jannah where large trees are described, mountains made of musk, between which rivers flow in valleys of pearl and ruby. Features of this garden of paradise are told in a parable in the . Islamic gardens can further divide the watercourses into four, meeting at a spring and including a sanctuary for shade and rest.\n\nIn myths of the Greater Iranian culture and tradition, Jamshid is described as saving the world by building a magical garden on top of a mountain. This garden also features a tree of life and is the source of a river that brings fertility to the land. Jamshid is warned by Ahura Mazda about a freezing winter approaching and so creates this enclosure to protect the seeds of life when a climatic catastrophe strikes.\n"}
{"id": "13547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13547", "title": "Hate crime", "text": "Hate crime\n\nA hate crime (also known as a bias-motivated crime or bias crime) is a prejudice-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her membership (or perceived membership) in a certain social group or race. \n\nExamples of such groups can include and are almost exclusively limited to: sex, ethnicity, disability, language, nationality, physical appearance, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation. Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called \"bias incidents\".\n\n\"Hate crime\" generally refers to criminal acts which are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, bullying, harassment, verbal abuse or insults, mate crime or offensive graffiti or letters (hate mail).\n\nA hate crime law is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence. Hate crime laws are distinct from laws against hate speech: hate crime laws enhance the penalties associated with conduct which is already criminal under other laws, while hate speech laws criminalize a category of speech. Hate speech laws exist in many countries. In the United States, hate crime laws have been upheld by both the Supreme Court and lower courts, especially in the case of 'fighting' words and other violent speech, but they are thought by some people to be in conflict with the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, but hate crimes are only regulated through threats of injury or death.\n\nThe term \"hate crime\" came into common usage in the United States during the 1980s, but the term is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era. From the Roman persecution of Christians to the Nazi slaughter of Jews, hate crimes were committed by both individuals and governments long before the term was commonly used.\n\nAs Europeans began to colonize the world from the 16th century onwards, indigenous peoples in the colonized areas, such as Native Americans increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated intimidation and violence. During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include lynchings of African Americans, largely in the South, and lynchings of Mexicans and Chinese in the West; cross burnings to intimidate black activists or to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after Reconstruction; assaults on white people traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods; assaults on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people; the painting of swastikas on Jewish synagogues; and xenophobic responses to a variety of minority ethnic groups.\n\nThe verb \"to lynch\" is attributed to the actions of Charles Lynch, an 18th-century Virginia Quaker. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up Tory sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe execution outside \"ordinary justice.\" It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent police authority, as in certain frontier areas of the Old West.\n\nThe murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom and the Wichita Massacre were not classified as \"hate crimes\" by U.S. investigative officials or the media. In the early 21st century, conservative commentators David Horowitz, Michelle Malkin (Fox News channel and author) and Stuart Taylor Jr. (journalist) did describe these events as \"hate crimes against whites by blacks.\"\n\nHate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging psychological consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias. A manual issued by the Attorney-General of the Province of Ontario in Canada lists the following consequences:\n\n\nHate crime victims can also develop depression and psychological trauma.\n\nA review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause Islamophobia and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorist's most persuasive message is that of fear and fear, a primary and strong emotion, increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly: terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as a window of opportunity for extremist groups and networks.\n\nHate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:\n\nSince 2002, with an amendment to the Convention on Cybercrime, the European Union mandates individual states to punish as a crime hate speech done through the internet.\n\nDiscriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.\n\nArmenia has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).\n\nAustria has a penalty-enhancement statute for reasons like repeating a crime, being especially cruel, using others helpless state, playing a leading role in a crime, or committing a crime with racist, xenophobic or especially reprehensible motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)).\n\nAzerbaijan has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111).\n\nBelarus has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.\n\nBelgium's Act of 25 February 2003 (\"aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism\") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also \"provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination.\" The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 (\"on strengthening legislation against racism\"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.\n\nThe Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina (enacted 2003) \"contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2).\"\n\nBulgarian criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and xenophobia, but a 1999 report by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance found that it does not appear that those provisions \"have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria.\"\n\nThe Croatian Penal Code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as \"any crime committed out of hatred for someone's race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute\". On 1 January 2013, a new Penal Code was introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on \"race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity\".\n\nThe Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.\nThe current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has three levels, to wit:\nCurrent criminal legislation does not provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.\n\nAlthough Danish law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, \"section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence.\" In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.\n\nSince 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.\n\nUnder section 151 of the Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, \"activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention\".\n\nFinnish Criminal Code 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes \"committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group\" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing. In addition, ethnic agitation () is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering (), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an overt act that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of\n\nIn 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).\n\n\"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious\ninjuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia.\"\n\nThe German Criminal Code does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes hate speech under a number of different laws, including Volksverhetzung. In the German legal framework motivation is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that \"the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission.\" can be taken into consideration when determining the punishment; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.\n\nHate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU \"Report on Racism\" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase. Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period. Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low.\n\nArticle Law 927/1979 \"Section 1,1 penalises incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence towards individuals or groups because of\ntheir racial, national or religious origin, through public written or oral expressions; Section 1,2 prohibits the\nestablishment of, and membership in, organisations which organise propaganda and activities aimed at racial\ndiscrimination; Section 2 punishes public expression of offensive ideas; Section 3 penalises the act of refusing,\nin the exercise of one’s occupation, to sell a commodity or to supply a service on racial grounds.\" Public prosecutors may press charges even if the victim does not file a complaint. However, as of 2003, no convictions had been attained under the law.\n\nViolent action, cruelty, and coercion by threat made on the basis of the victim's actual or perceived national, ethnic, religious status or membership in a particular social group are punishable under article 174/B of the Hungarian Criminal Code. This article was added to the Code in 1996.\n\nSection 233a of the Icelandic Penal Code states \"Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly abuses a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to two years.\"\n\n\"The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989\" makes it an offense to incite hatred against any group of persons on account of their race, color, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the Traveller community, an indigenous minority group.\"\n\nIreland does not systematically collect hate crime data.\n\nItalian criminal law, at Section 3 of Law No. 205/1993, the so-called \"\" (Mancino law), contains a penalty-enhancement provision for all crimes motivated by racial, sex/gender, ethnic, national, or religious bias.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, there are constitutional provisions prohibiting propaganda promoting racial or ethnic superiority.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, \"the Constitution of the State party prohibits any kind of discrimination on grounds of origin, sex, race, nationality, language, faith, political or religious convictions or any other personal or social trait or circumstance, and that the prohibition against racial discrimination is also included in other legislation, such as the Civil, Penal and Labour Codes.\"\n\nArticle 299 of the Criminal Code defines incitement to national, racist, or religious hatred as a specific offense. This article has been used in political trials of suspected members of the banned organization Hizb-ut-Tahrir.\n\nArticle 29 of the penal code of the Russian Federation bans incitement to riot for the sake of stirring societal, racial, ethnic, and religious hatred as well as the promotion of the superiority of the same. Article 282 further includes protections against incitement of hatred (including gender) via various means of communication, instilling criminal penalties including fines and imprisonment.\n\nArticle 22(4) of the Spanish Penal Code includes a penalty-enhancement provision for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's ideology, beliefs, religion, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, illness or disability.\n\nArticle 29 of the Swedish Penal Code includes a penalty-enhancement provision for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's race, color, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or \"other similar circumstance\" of the victim.\n\nI. \"\"Constitution of Ukraine\" :\n\nThe most important law of the Ukraine country : the \"Constitution of Ukraine\"\" guarantees protection against Hate crime :\n\n\"\"Constitution of Ukraine\"\" :\n\nArticle 10 : \"In Ukraine, free development, use and protection of Russian and \"other languages\" of national minorities of Ukraine are guaranteed\". \n\nArticle 11 : \"The state shall promote the development of ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of all indigenous peoples and national minorities of Ukraine\".\n\nArticle 24 :\"There can be no privileges or restrictions on the grounds of race, color of the skin, political, religious or other beliefs, sex, ethnic or social origin, property status, place of residence, language or other grounds\".\nII. \"CRIMINAL CODEX OF UKRAINE\" :\n\nin Ukraine, all criminal punishments for crimes committed under the law are required to be registered in only one law, it is the only one: \"CRIMINAL CODEX OF UKRAINE\"\n\nThe crimes committed for Hate crime reinforce the punishment in many articles of the criminal law. There are also separate articles on punishment for Hate crime.\n\n\"CRIMINAL CODEX OF UKRAINE\" :\n\nArticle 161 : \"Violations of equality of citizens depending on their race, nationality, religious beliefs, disability and other grounds\n\n1. Intentional acts aimed at incitement to national, racial or religious hatred and violence, to humiliate national honor and dignity, or to repulse citizens' feelings due to their religious beliefs, as well as direct or indirect restriction of rights or the establishment of direct or indirect privileges citizens on the grounds of race, color, political, religious or other beliefs, sex, disability, ethnic or social origin, property status, place of residence, language or other grounds\"(Maximum criminal sentence of up to 8 years in prison)\n\nArticle 300 : \"Importation, manufacture or distribution of works promoting a cult of violence and cruelty, racial, national or religious intolerance and discrimination\" (Maximum criminal sentence of up to 5 years in prison)\n\nFor England, Wales, and Scotland, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 makes hateful behaviour towards a victim based on the victim's membership (or presumed membership) in a racial group or a religious group an aggravation in sentencing for specified crimes. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (c. 24) amended sections of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. For Northern Ireland, Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purpose. A \"racial group\" is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A \"religious group\" is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the Public Order Act 1986, and offences under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.\n\nSections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 require a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated, and to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:\n\nThe Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) reported in 2013 that there are an average of 278,000 hate crimes a year with 40% being reported according to a victims survey, although police records only identified around 43,000 hate crimes a year. It was widely reported that police recorded a 57% increase in hate crime complaints in the four days following the UK's European Union membership referendum, however a press release from the National Police Chief's Council stated that \"this should not be read as a national increase in hate crime of 57 per cent”.\n\nIn 2013, Greater Manchester Police began recording attacks on goths, punks and other alternative culture groups as hate crimes.\n\nOn December 4, 2013 Essex Police launched the ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative as part of a concerted effort to find new ways to tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in Chelmsford, hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organisations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.\n\nCrown Prosecution Service guidance issued on 21 August 2017 stated that online hate crimes should be treated as seriously as offences in person.\n\nPerhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in Eltham, London, on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a \"not guilty\" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.\n\nUnder Scottish Common law the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence. There is legislation dealing with the offences of incitement of racial hatred, racially aggravated harassment, prejudice relating to religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation, and transgender identity. A Scottish Executive working group examined the issue of hate crime and ways of combating crime motivated by social prejudice, reporting in 2004. Its main recommendations were not implemented, but in their manifestos for the Scottish Parliament election, 2007 several political parties included commitments to legislate in this area, including the Scottish National Party who now form the Scottish Government. The Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice) (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 19 May 2008 by Patrick Harvie MSP, having been prepared with support from the Scottish Government, and was passed unanimously by the parliament on 3 June 2009.\n\nAlbania, Cyprus, San Marino, Slovenia and Turkey have no hate crime laws.\n\n\"In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code\".\nIn 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):\n\n\"A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:\n\n\"(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,\"\n\n\"(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.\"\"\nA vast majority (84 per cent) of hate crime perpetrators were \"male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady 2010 page 163.).\"\nAs of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).\n\nDuring the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate related violence in Canada. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event erupted into a brawl that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.\n\nThe first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. \"A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996).\"\n\nHate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime laws were passed after the American Civil War, beginning with the Civil Rights Act of 1871, to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes being committed by the Reconstruction era Ku Klux Klan. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the Civil Rights Act which made it illegal to \"by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin.\" However, \"The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.\".\n\nThe first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for penalty enhancement in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four \"protected status\" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included ancestry in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included creed and sex in 1982 and later disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. In the 1990s some state laws began to include age, marital status, membership in the armed forces, and membership in civil rights organizations.\n\nCriminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included aggravated assault, assault and battery, vandalism, rape, threats and intimidation, arson, trespassing, stalking, and various \"lesser\" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes.\n\nDefined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, \"A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the United States, federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity.\" In 2009, the Matthew Shepard Act added actual or perceived gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n\nForty-five states and the District of Columbia have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a civil cause of action in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics.\n\nAccording to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies. Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 32% as simple assaults. 81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.\n\nHowever, according to the FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies. These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder said in June 2009 that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop \"violence masquerading as political activism\".\n\nThe 2011 hate crime statistics show 46.9% were motivated by race and 20.8% by sexual orientation.\n\nIn 2015, the Hate Crimes Statistics report identified 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 6,837 offenses, 7,121 victims, and 5,475 known offenders\n\nProsecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently though, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One prominent example is Mississippi's decision in 1990 to retry Byron De La Beckwith for the murder of Medgar Evers, a prominent figure in the NAACP. This would be the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case would be re-opened. Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions and it resulted with a hung jury. However, he was finally sentenced to life in prison in 1994. Presented with testimony of two FBI informants who had infiltrated the KKK, the missing transcript from the first trial, the relocation of missing witnesses, numerous witness admissions of Beckwith bragging about his role in the murder and Beckwith's own racist writings, a mixed race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. Even though De La Beckwith was 73 years of age when he was sentenced to life in prison, the 1994 conviction has been interpreted as a way for Mississippi to shed its racist past.\n\nAccording to a November 2016 report issued by the FBI hate crime statistics are on the rise in the United States. The number of hate crimes increased from 5,850 in 2015, to 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent.\n\nOne of the largest waves of hate crimes took place during the civil rights movement. During the 1950s and 1960s, both violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this social class faced violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining segregation. At the time, civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the Civil War, and the humiliation of this social class was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin. At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.\n\nAnalysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them, to allow for differing populations.\nOverall, the total number of hate crimes committed since the first hate crime bill was passed in 1997 is 86,582. David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act\nAmong the groups currently mentioned in the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans. During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, as well as the burning of crosses, churches, Jewish synagogues and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the racial integration of many schools and public facilities.\n\nHigh-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of Sean W. Kennedy and Matthew Shepard. Kennedy's murder was mentioned by Senator Gordon Smith in a speech on the floor of the US Senate while he advocated such legislation. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, the disabled, and military personnel and their family members. This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.\n\nGender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes. This view would designate rape and domestic violence, as well as non-interpersonal violence against women such as the École Polytechnique massacre in Quebec, as hate crimes.\n\nIn May 2018, \"ProPublica\" reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. \"ProPublica\" found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. \"ProPublica\" found not a single case of a hate crime spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.\n\nIn Brazil, hate crime laws focus on racism, racial injury, and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by death squads and genocide on the grounds of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion. Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as \"hideous crimes\" (\"crimes hediondos\" in Portuguese).\n\nThe crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently. Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the Penal Code establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by \"elements referring to race, color, ethnicity, religion, origin, or the condition of being an aged or disabled person\". On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers \"crimes resulting from discrimination or prejudice on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin\".\n\nIn addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a \"fundamental goal of the Republic\" (Article 3rd, clause IV) \"to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to origin, race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination\".\n\nIn 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: \"Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability.\"\n\n3.4.1. Israel\nIsrael is the only country in the middle east who has hate crime laws. Hate crime, as passed by the Isreli Knesset (Parliament), is defined as crime for reason of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation\n\nJustifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.\n\nIn \"Wisconsin v. Mitchell\", the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found that \"penalty-enhancement\" hate crime statutes do not conflict with free speech rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising freedom of expression; rather, they allow courts to consider motive when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the First Amendment. Whilst in the case of \"Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire\" the court defined \"fighting words\" as \"those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics. Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, thought crimes.\n\nIn their book \"Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics\", James B. Jacobs and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups. They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as \"hate crimes\" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime. Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out. Indeed it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is no necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes. Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism. \n\nSome have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced. American forensic psychologist Karen Franklin said that the term \"hate crime\" is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts. Some on the political left have been critical of hate crime laws for expanding the criminal justice system and dealing with violence against minority groups through punitive measures.\n\n\n"}

It convened because of an interest in moral education by many countries beginning a decade before the inaugural event. The movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the Ethical movement. The idea to hold the congress was at the behest of the International Union of Ethical Societies; its greatest proponents were Professor Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster and Gustav Spiller, the secretary of the Union. The first congress was held in 1908, and except for one 10-year beak (1912-1922), the congress met every four years in various cities. The official languages were German, English, and French.\n\nThe Moral Education League of London was founded in 1897. This organization exercised a considerable influence, not only in the United Kingdom but in various parts of the British Empire and throughout the world. Its president was John Stuart Mackenzie. Among its members were Catholics, Anglicans, Jews, Unitarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Nonconformists, Ethicists, Rationalists, Positivists, and others. Its secretary was Harrold Johnson, who was later appointed Hon. Secretary of the International Moral Education Congress Executive Council. The league also employed a demonstrator, Frederick James Gould, who acquired an international reputation for his numerous \nbooks on moral lessons. This League succeeded in 1906 in inducing the Board of Education to make provision for moral instruction in the education code for England and Wales.\n\nIn 1905, a new Italian Education Code was published, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year, a new Hungarian Education Code was issued. In 1905, a new Austrian Education Code came to light. In Portugal, a manual of Moral Instruction for Primary Schools, as distinct from Religious Instruction, was officially published in 1906. In the United States, schemes of moral instruction were elaborated in many places. In Germany, the Reading Books for Elementary Schools contained abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland, several Cantons took distinct steps in the direction of drawing up Moral Instruction Programmes. In Belgium, Moral Instruction Syllabuses for Primary Schools and for Training Colleges existed. In France and Japan, where moral instruction was introduced, the subject was being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia, the authorities were turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England, the Code of the Board of Education for 1906 stated that \"Moral instruction should form an important part of every school curriculum\". Educationists generally laid increasing emphasis on the moral factor in education, while men in every walk of life came more and more to feel that the training of the intellect must be accompanied by the development of character if the school is to serve effectively the nation and humanity. This movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the Ethical movement.\n\nThe First Congress was held at the University of London, London, England, on September 25–29, 1908. Michael Sadler served as president. The Congress counted altogether some 1,800 members and 2,000 volumes of the Papers on Moral Education were disposed of within less than four weeks after the first Congress met. Both the educational magazines and the leading daily papers rendered valuable assistance to the Congress. There were sessions on the following topics: The Principles of Moral Education; Aims, Means and Limitations in the various types of schools; Character Building by Discipline, Influence and Opportunity; the Problems of Moral Instruction; Relation of Religious Education to Moral Education; Systematic Moral Instruction; The Relation of Moral Education to Education under Other Aspects; the Problem of Moral Education under varying conditions of Age and Opportunity; Biology and Moral Education.\n\nThe Second Congress was held at the Hague, August 22–27, 1912. Dr. J. Th. Mouton was the President of the Executive Committee. The following twenty-three countries sent official government delegates: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, India (British), Ireland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Romania, South Australia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and Tunis. Over 1,000 members (apart from honorary members) were officially enrolled for the congress. Over 200 papers of some 2,000 words each were contributed and appeared in the five published volumes of more than 1,200 pages. The subjects dealt with and under discussion at the various sessions were: Moral Education and Character Building considered from the Denominationalist, the Undenominationalist and the Independent-Moralist points of view; Moral Education considered from social and national points of view Formation of the Will; Physical Training as a means of Character-Building; Moral Education considered from a Practical Point of View; the Moral Education of Adolescents; Character-Building in family life and in society at large; Character-Building of young people at educational institutions not dedicated to the ordinary primary education; Character-Building of Abnormal Children. This Congress stated it would not advocate the views of any society or party, but it would afford to all who are interested in moral education, whatever their religious or ethical convictions, nationality and point of view, an equal opportunity of expressing their opinions and comparing them with those of others. This proved so good a basis that the congress with unanimity adopted it as the basis of future congresses, with the addition of the following object: The object of the Congress is to enlist the active co-operation of all, irrespective of race, nations, and creed, in promoting the work of moral education. The first aim of the Second Congress, as of the first, was to cultivate the co-operation of men and women representing different schools of thought in matters of education, giving every one an opportunity in the spirit of toleration, of defining and explaining his opinion and point of view.\n\nThe Third Congress met in the Aula, or Assembly Hall, of the University of Geneva, July 28 to August 1, 1922. About 500 members attended, representing 30 nationalities and 29 national committees. Thirty-three papers were contributed, all being published in French, in two volumes, by Delachaux, at Neuchatel. The topics were confined to (1) the international motive, with special reference to the teaching of history; and (2) the motive of service. Frederick Pollock gave the inaugural address on behalf of the International Executive Council (London), and was followed by the newly elected president of the Congress, Dr. Adolphe Ferrière, who was an advocate of progressive education. Among the speakers during the eight sessions, perhaps the most popular were three—Professor Foerster; M. Albert Thomas, Director of the Labor Office of the League of Nations; and Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. A special session was held in the hall of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, chaired by Gustav Spiller, which included Nitobe Inazō, Director of the Section of International Bureaus. The Congress approved of the establishment of an International Moral Education Bureau at the Hague, and decided to form a permanent association of educationists of the world, based on the 29 national committees already existing.\n\nThe Fourth Congress took place in Rome, Italy, from September 28 to October 2, 1926. Francesco Orestano served as president.\n\nThe Fifth Congress took place at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, France, September 23–27, 1930. Sébastien Charléty served as president.\n\nThe Sixth Congress took place in Krakow, Poland, September 11–14, 1934.\n\nIn 2004, Marco Cicchini of the University of Geneva published his study based on a review of the proceedings and publications of the six congresses. He synthesized the congresses' aims and ideals, the theoretical and institutional outlines, the socio-professional profiles of the participants, the status of their contributions, and the disciplines invited to discuss the issues. He also noted on the changes which led to the disappearance of the congress.\n"}

The consistency strength of KP with an axiom of infinity is given by the Bachmann–Howard ordinal. Unlike ZFC, KP does not include the power set axiom, and KP includes only limited forms of the axiom of separation and axiom of replacement from ZFC. These restrictions on the axioms of KP lead to close connections between KP, generalized recursion theory, and the theory of admissible ordinals.\n\nHere, a Σ, or Π, or Δ formula is one all of whose quantifiers are bounded. This means any quantification is the form formula_1 or formula_2 (More generally, we would say that a formula is Σ when it is obtained by adding existential quantifiers in front of a Π formula, and that it is Π when it is obtained by adding universal quantifiers in front of a Σ formula: this is related to the arithmetical hierarchy but in the context of set theory.)\n\nThese axioms are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the axioms of powerset, choice, and sometimes infinity. Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas φ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only.\n\nThe axiom of induction in KP is stronger than the usual axiom of regularity (which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set)).\n\nTheorem:\n\nIf \"A\" and \"B\" are sets, then there is a set \"A\"×\"B\" which consists of all ordered pairs (\"a\", \"b\") of elements \"a\" of \"A\" and \"b\" of \"B\".\n\nProof:\n\nThe set {\"a\"} (which is the same as {\"a\", \"a\"} by the axiom of extensionality) and the set {\"a\", \"b\"} both exist by the axiom of pairing. Thus \nexists by the axiom of pairing as well.\n\nA possible Δ formula expressing that \"p\" stands for (\"a\", \"b\") is:\n\nThus a superset of \"A\"×{\"b\"} = {(\"a\", \"b\") | \"a\" in \"A\"} exists by the axiom of collection.\n\nDenote the formula for \"p\" above by formula_6. Then the following formula is also Δ\n\nThus \"A\"×{\"b\"} itself exists by the axiom of separation.\n\nIf \"v\" is intended to stand for \"A\"×{\"b\"}, then a Δ formula expressing that is:\n\nThus a superset of {\"A\"×{\"b\"} | \"b\" in \"B\"} exists by the axiom of collection.\n\nPutting formula_9 in front of that last formula and we get from the axiom of separation that the set {\"A\"×{\"b\"} | \"b\" in \"B\"} itself exists.\n\nFinally, \"A\"×\"B\" = formula_10{\"A\"×{\"b\"} | \"b\" in \"B\"} exists by the axiom of union.\n\nQED\n\nA set formula_11 is called admissible if it is transitive and formula_12 is a model of Kripke–Platek set theory.\n\nAn ordinal number α is called an admissible ordinal if L is an admissible set.\n\nThe ordinal α is an admissible ordinal if and only if α is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a γ<α for which there is a Σ(L) mapping from γ onto α. If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal.\n\nIf L is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Σ-collection, then it is said to be an \"amenable set\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3331706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3331706", "title": "Logical form", "text": "Logical form\n\nIn philosophy and mathematics, a logical form of a syntactic expression is a precisely-specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal formal language, the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from syntax alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one string that represents the same logical form in a given language.\n\nThe logical form of an argument is called the argument form or \"test form\" of the argument.\n\nThe importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. Aristotle, in the Prior Analytics, was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, Łukasiewicz claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.\n\nAccording to the followers of Aristotle like Ammonius, only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms \"man\", \"mortal\", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek \"hyle\", Latin \"materia\") of the argument.\n\nThe term \"logical form\" itself was introduced by Bertrand Russell in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called philosophical logic. Russell wrote: \"Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure.\"\nTo demonstrate the important notion of the \"form\" of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.\n\nAll we have done in the \"Argument form\" is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the \"form\" of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the \"Argument form\" is the \"sentence form\" of its respective sentence in the original argument.\n\nAttention is given to argument and sentence form, because \"form is what makes an argument valid or cogent\". All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are modus ponens, modus tollens, and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows. Two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent. \n\n\n\nA logical argument, seen as an ordered set of sentences, has a logical form that derives from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form. Some authors only define logical form with respect to whole arguments, as the schemata or inferential structure of the argument. In argumentation theory or informal logic, an argument form is sometimes seen as a broader notion than the logical form.\n\nIt consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to \"the subject matter\" of the argument by schematic variables. Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.\n\nThe fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat: \n\nThe more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving logical connectives, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the problem of multiple generality, where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as \"Some guys have all the luck\", because both quantities \"all\" and \"some\" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.\n\n\n\n"}

It provides advantages both of classical cellular automaton and discrete element methods. Important advantage of the МСА method is a possibility of direct simulation of materials fracture including damage generation, crack propagation, fragmentation and mass mixing. It is difficult to simulate these processes by means of continuum mechanics methods (For example: finite element method, finite difference method, etc.), so some new concepts like peridynamics are required. Discrete element method is very effective to simulate granular materials, but mutual forces among movable cellular automata provides simulating solids behavior. If size of automaton will be close to zero then MCA behavior becomes like classical continuum mechanics methods.\n\nIn framework of the MCA approach an object under modeling is considered as a set of interacting elements/automata. The dynamics of the set of automata are defined by their mutual forces and rules for their relationships. This system exists and operates in time and space. Its evolution in time and space is governed by the equations of motion. The mutual forces and rules for inter-elements relationships are defined by the function of the automaton response. This function has to be specified for each automaton. Due to mobility of automata the following new parameters of cellular automata have to be included into consideration: \"R\" – radius-vector of automaton; \"V\" – velocity of automaton; ω – rotation velocity of automaton; \"θ\" – rotation vector of automaton; \"m\" – mass of automaton; \"J\" – moment of inertia of automaton.\n\nThe new concept of the MCA method is based on the introducing of the state of the pair of automata (relation of interacting pairs of automata) in addition to the conventional one – the state of a separate automaton. Note that the introduction of this definition allows to go from the static net concept to the concept of neighbours. As a result of this, the automata have the ability to change their neighbors by switching the states (relationships) of the pairs.\n\nThe introducing of new type of states leads to new parameter to use it as criteria for switching relationships. It is defined as an automaton overlapping parameters \"h\". So the relationship of the cellular automata is characterised by the value of their overlapping.\n\nThe initial structure is formed by setting up certain relationships among each pair of neighboring elements.\n\nIn contrast to the classical cellular automaton method in the MCA method not only a single automaton but also a relationship of pair of automata can be switched. According with the bistable automata concept there are two types of the pair states (relationships):\n\nSo the changing of the state of pair relationships is controlled by relative movements of the automata and the media formed by such pairs can be considered as bistable media.\n\nThe evolution of MCA media is described by the following equations of motion for translation:\n\nHere m is the mass of automaton i, p is central force acting between automata i and j, C(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the h parameter from pair ij to pair ik, ψ(α) is angle between directions ij and ik.\n\nDue to finite size of movable automata the rotation effects have to be taken into account. The equations of motion for rotation can be written as follows:\n\nHere Θ is the angle of relative rotation (it is a switching parameter like h for translation), q is the distance from center of automaton i to contact point of automaton j (moment arm), τ is the pair tangential interaction, S(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the Θ parameter from one pair to other (it is similar to C(ij,ik) from the equation for translation).\n\nIt should be noted that these equations are completely similar to the equations of motion for the many–particle approach.\n\nTranslation of the pair automata\nThe dimensionless deformation parameter for translation of the i j automata pair can be presented as:\n\nIn this case:\n\nwhere Δt time step, V – relative velocity.\n\nRotation of the pair automata can be calculated by analogy with the last translation relationships.\n\nThe ε parameter is used as a measure of deformation of automaton i under its interaction with automaton j. Where q – is a distance from the center of automaton i to its contact point with automaton j; R = d/2 (d – is the size of automaton i).\n\nAs an example the titanium specimen under cyclic loading (tension – compression) is considered. The loading diagram is shown in the next figure:\n\nDue to mobility of each automaton the MCA method allows to take into account directly such actions as:\n\n\nUsing boundary conditions of different types (fixed, elastic, viscous-elastic, etc.) it is possible to imitate different properties of surrounding medium, containing the simulated system. It is possible to model different modes of mechanical loading (tension, compression, shear strain, etc.) by setting up additional conditions at the boundaries.\n\n\n\n"}

The state of the system is generally determined by a finite set of coordinates, and the parametrization consists thus of one function of several real variables for each coordinate. The number of parameters is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.\n\nFor example, the position of a point that moves on a curve in the three-dimensional space is determined by the time needed to reach the point when starting from a fixed origin.

Such a parametric equation determines completely the curve, without the need of any interpretation of as a time, and is thus called a \"parametric equation\" of the curve (this is sometimes abbreviated by saying that one has a \"parametric curve\"). One gets similarly the parametric equation of a surface by considering functions of two parameters and .\n\nParametrizations are not generally unique. The ordinary three-dimensional object can be parametrized (or 'coordinatized') equally efficiently with Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z), cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, φ, z), spherical coordinates (r,φ,θ) or other coordinate systems.\n\nSimilarly, the color space of human trichromatic color vision can be parametrized in terms of the three colors red, green and blue, RGB, or with cyan, magenta, yellow and black, CMYK.\n\nGenerally, the minimum number of parameters required to describe a model or geometric object is equal to its dimension, and the scope of the parameters—within their allowed ranges—is the parameter space. Though a good set of parameters permits identification of every point in the parameter space, it may be that, for a given parametrization, different parameter values can refer to the same 'physical' point. Such mappings are surjective but not injective. An example is the pair of cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ,φ,z) and (ρ,φ + 2π,z).\n\nAs indicated above, there is arbitrariness in the choice of parameters of a given model, geometric object, etc. Often, one wishes to determine intrinsic properties of an object that do not depend on this arbitrariness, which are therefore independent of any particular choice of parameters. This is particularly the case in physics, wherein parametrization invariance (or 'reparametrization invariance') is a guiding principle in the search for physically acceptable theories (particularly in general relativity).\n\nFor example, whilst the location of a fixed point on some curved line may be given by a set of numbers whose values depend on how the curve is parametrized, the length (appropriately defined) of the curve between \"two\" such fixed points will be independent of the particular choice of parametrization (in this case: the method by which an arbitrary point on the line is uniquely indexed). The length of the curve is therefore a parameterization-invariant quantity. In such cases parameterization is a mathematical tool employed to extract a result whose value does not depend on, or make reference to, the details of the parameterization. More generally, parametrization invariance of a physical theory implies that either the dimensionality or the volume of the parameter space is larger than is necessary to describe the physics (the quantities of physical significance) in question.\n\nThough the theory of general relativity can be expressed without reference to a coordinate system, calculations of physical (i.e. observable) quantities such as the curvature of spacetime invariably involve the introduction of a particular coordinate system in order to refer to spacetime points involved in the calculation. In the context of general relativity then, the choice of coordinate system may be regarded as a method of 'parameterizing' the spacetime, and the insensitivity of the result of a calculation of a physically-significant quantity to that choice can be regarded as an example of parameterization invariance.\n\nAs another example, physical theories whose observable quantities depend only on the \"relative\" distances (the ratio of distances) between pairs of objects are said to be scale invariant. In such theories any reference in the course of a calculation to an absolute distance would imply the introduction of a parameter to which the theory is invariant.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a scientific study which aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces. Its areas of focus include:\n\n\n\"Personality\" is a dynamic and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences their environment, cognitions, emotions, motivations, and behaviors in various situations. The word \"personality\" originates from the Latin \"persona\", which means \"mask\".\n\nPersonality also refers to the pattern of thoughts, feelings, social adjustments, and behaviors consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, self-perceptions, values, and attitudes. Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and stress. Gordon Allport (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the idiographic. \"Nomothetic psychology\" seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of self-actualization or the trait of extraversion. \"Idiographic psychology\" is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.\n\nThe study of personality has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical trad. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on multivariate statistics, such as factor analysis, or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the psychodynamic theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in abnormal psychology or clinical psychology.\n\nMany of the ideas developed by historical and modern personality theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of art, science, and philosophy to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:\n\n\nPersonality type refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from personality traits, which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. A \"theory of personality\" constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories or sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore the theory. For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The idea of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of Carl Jung, specifically in his 1921 book \"Psychologische Typen\" (\"Psychological Types\") and William Marston.\n\nBuilding on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. This model was later used by David Keirsey with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers. In the former Soviet Union, Lithuanian Aušra Augustinavičiūtė independently derived a model of personality type from Jung's called socionics.\n\nTheories could also be considered an \"approach\" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model. The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:\n\n\nBriggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world. Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgment) or to keep options open (perception).\n\nThis personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics. In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into \"N\" (intuitive) or \"S\" (sensing) personality types. An \"N\" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the \"NT\" (scientist, engineer) or \"NF\" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An \"S\", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the \"SJ\" (guardian, traditionalist) or \"SP\" (performer, artisan) temperament. These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions), and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice. This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances. (It should be noted, however, that the MBTI is not designed to measure the \"work self\", but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the \"shoes-off self.\")\n\nType A and Type B personality theory: During the 1950s, Meyer Friedman and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are \"stress junkies.\" Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.\n\nJohn L. Holland's \"RIASEC\" vocational model, commonly referred to as the \"Holland Codes\", stipulates that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.\n\nEduard Spranger's personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of \"value attitudes\", described in his book \"Types of Men\" (\"Lebensformen\"; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).\n\nThe Enneagram of Personality, a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.\n\nPerhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the personality typology outlined by the Indian Buddhist Abhidharma schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive meditation practices used to counter those traits.\n\nPsychoanalytic theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. Sigmund Freud was the founder of this school of thought. Freud drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term psychodynamics. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. Freud's theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.\n\nFreud divides human personality into three significant components: the id, ego and super-ego. The id acts according to the \"pleasure principle\", demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the ego then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the \"reality principle\". Finally, the superego (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.\n\nThe channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the \"Eros\" (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and \"Thanatos\" (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory. It is important to note that Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.\n\nFreud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five. Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.\n\nOne of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, Alfred Adler, did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious. He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements. He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed with their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.\n\nHeinz Kohut thought similarly to Freud's idea of transference. He used narcissism as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally \"sink into\" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.\n\nAnother important figure in the world of personality theory is Karen Horney. She is credited with the development of the \"real self\" and the \"ideal self\". She believes all people have these two views of their own self. The \"real self\" is how humans act with regard to personality, values, and morals; but the \"ideal self\" is a construct individuals implement in order to conform to social and personal norms.\n\nBehaviorists explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior. The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation. This school of thought was developed by B. F. Skinner who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or \"the organism\" with its environment. Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention. These are the \"response\", and \"consequences\". The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as operant conditioning. Skinner put forward a \"three term contingency model\" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the \"Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model\" in which the critical question is: \"Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?\"\n\nRichard Herrnstein extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits. An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable. Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion. Herrstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.\n\nIvan Pavlov is another notable influence. He is well known for his classical conditioning experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.\n\nIn cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.\n\nAlbert Bandura, a social learning theorist suggested the forces of memory and emotions worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his \"Bobo doll experiment\". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.\n\nEarly examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982). These include Witkin's (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner's (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorise heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen's (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to ego psychology. More central to this field have been:\n\n\nVarious scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale. Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Attributions Questionnaire, the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.\n\n\nRecognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement. Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.\n\nWalter Mischel (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to \"Cognitive Affective Units\", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term \"Cognitive Affective Units\" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.\n\nCognitive-Experiential Self-Theory (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory. Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system. The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven. The rational system is slow and logic-driven. These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.\n\nPersonal construct psychology (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist George Kelly in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.)\nFrom the theory, Kelly derived a psychotherapy approach and also a technique called \"The Repertory Grid Interview\" that helped his patients to uncover their own \"constructs\" with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The repertory grid was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people's world-views.\n\nHumanistic psychology emphasizes that people have free will and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior. Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers were proponents of this view, which is based on the \"phenomenal field\" theory of Combs and Snygg (1949). Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the \"Journal of Humanistic Psychology\". This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.\n\nRobert W. White wrote the book \"The Abnormal Personality\" that became a standard text on abnormal psychology. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of Freud on the pathological elements of personality development.\n\nMaslow spent much of his time studying what he called \"self-actualizing persons\", those who are \"fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing\". Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:\n\nMaslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, \"It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage\". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.\n\nBiology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities. Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of Phineas Gage. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions of these psychological changes are usually exaggerated.\n\nIn general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and more recently functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain.\n\nEver since the Human Genome Project allowed for a much more in depth understanding of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.\nPreviously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as behavioural genetics. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.\nDNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.\n\nCattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a strong influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from twin studies. This \"twin method\" compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical twins. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.\n\nTwin studies have also been important in the creation of the five factor personality model: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20. It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.\n\nCharles Darwin is the founder of the theory of the evolution of the species. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory. This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on natural selection. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism's environment and how these traits aid in an organism's survival and reproduction.\n\nPolymorphisms, such as gender and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole. The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance. The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.\n\nIn the 1930s, John Dollard and Neal Elgar Miller met at Yale University, and began an attempt to integrate drives (see Drive theory), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of Clark Hull. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives. \n\nSecondary drives are internal needs directing the behaviour of an individual that results from learning. Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by classical conditioning. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment. When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus. Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist's office. \n\nSecondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist. Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence. Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.\n\nSecondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.\n\nSecondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others. Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive). Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development. As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement. Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious. Dollard and Miller's belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive Sigmund Freud's theory of psychosexual development. They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.\n\nDollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should. These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality. This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.\n\nThere are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.\n\n\"Projective tests\" assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the Rorschach test and the Thematic Apperception Test.\n\nThe Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of \"perceived images\" and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual's personality and their unique characteristics. The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person's response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.\nThe Thematic Apperception Test (also known as the TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these \"scenes\" include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom. Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.\n\n\"Objective tests\" assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.\n\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on Carl Jung's Type theory. \n\nPsychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain. In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is qualia. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one's character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.\n\nDescriptive experience sampling (DES), developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an idiographic method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.\n\nArticulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.\n\nExperimental method: This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized.\n\n\n"}

This analysis allows one to predict the width of the maxillary arch at the premolar and molar region by measure the mesio-distal widths of the four permanent incisors. The analysis helps to determine if the dental arch is narrow or normal and if expansion is possible or not.\n\nThe width from Left Premolar to Right Premolar or \"Measured Premolar Value (MPV)\" can be calculated by using Sum of Incisal Widths (S.I) of incisors and multiplying it by 100. The result can be divided by 80.\n\nThe width from Left Molar to Right Molar or \"Measured Molar Value (MMV)\" can be calculated by using the S.I of incisors and multiplying by 100. The result is divided by 64.\n\nThe widths are measured from occlusal grooves of both premolars and molars.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of this analysis is that the analysis was initially done on French Population by Pont. Therefore, the data cannot be used to make predictions for other populations. This analysis also does not take the alignment of the teeth into consideration. In addition, because this analysis only applies to the upper arch serves a drawback also. Maxillary teeth are often missing and Peg Laterals are often seen in the maxillary arch.\n\nLinder Hath index is derived from Pont's Index. The Hath index has a slight variation from Pont's analysis. In the maxillary arch instead of 80, Linder Harth Index uses 85 to achieve the Measured Molar Value.\n\n"}

The introduction of this concept served a double purpose: to reassess sociology as a science of the present (moving beyond the early 20th century conceptual framework); and to provide a counterbalance to the postmodernist paradigm offering a re-constructive view alongside deconstruction.\n\nThe concept built upon previous notions such as post-industrial society (Daniel Bell) and postmaterial society, but stresses how in reflexive modernization, modernity directs its attention to the process of modernization itself.\n\nThe main thesis deals with the changes brought on by the realisation of modernity's ideals, such as universal suffrage and education, the welfare state, civil and political rights, changes that marked the shift to the second modernity. The authors consider it a reflexive modernity because it opposes its earlier version, in the same way as the first modernity opposed feudal traditionalism. As a consequence, the institutions of the first modernity are beginning to crumble in the face of economic and cultural globalization. The state is starting to lose its importance with the rise of transnational forces (corporations, NGOs), the family is splitting apart with rising divorce rates favoured by the flexibility of work and the women's liberation, losing its supportive function in the process, religion is reduced to a cultural artifact, traditional political action is boycotted because of a lack of identification with the parties' goals. Therefore all previous sources of solidarity lose momentum with the rise of individualization. \n\nUlrich Beck focuses on the dissolution of traditional institutions and the rise of transnational forces, while promoting a new type solidarity in the face of the human made dangers of the risk society, exacerbated by the inherent limits being discovered to all forms of social knowing. Giddens proposes a third way of social policies aimed at tackling the new challenges to identity and life choices created by the biographical risks and uncertainties of reflexive modernity. Zygmunt Bauman talks about the social effects of globalization, as it seems to create new divisions between the people connected to the global flux of information (the 'tourists') and those excluded from them, not needed as workforce anymore (the 'bums').\n\nRonald Inglehart studies the shift of human values from material to post-material in the Western societies by analyzing the World Values Survey databases; and Pippa Norris stresses the importance of cultural globalization over economical globalization, while also talking about the new divisions, such as the digital divide.\n\nReflexive modernization is a process of modernization that is characteristic of risk society whereby progress is achieved through reorganization and \"reform\". Science and technology as it is used for the purpose of reflexive modernization is less concerned with expanding the resource base, but rather with re-evaluating that which is already being used by society. There is a constant flow of information between science and industry, and progress is achieved through the resulting reforms, optimizations and adaptations. Examples of reflexive modernization that have recently gained political momentum are sustainability and the precautionary principle. The new social movements (feminist, green, and pirate parties) are also considered to be an expression of reflexive modernization.\n\nBauman, Zygmunt (2000) Liquid Modernity.

Religious views on truth vary between religions.\n\nThe Four Noble Truths are the most fundamental Buddhist teachings and appear countless times throughout the most ancient Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon. They arose from Buddha's enlightenment and are regarded in Buddhism as deep spiritual insight, \"not as philosophical theory\", with Buddha noting in the Samyutta Nikaya: \"These Four Noble Truths, monks, are actual, unerring, not otherwise. Therefore, they are called noble truths.\"\n\nThe Four Noble Truths (\"Catvāry Āryasatyāni\") are as follows: \n\nThe two truths doctrine in Buddhism differentiates between two levels of truth in Buddhist discourse, a \"relative\", or commonsense truth (Tibetan: \"kun-rdzob bden-pa\"; Sanskrit: \"samvrtisatya\"), and an \"ultimate\" or absolute spiritual truth (Tibetan: \"don-dam bden-pa\"; Sanskrit: \"paramarthasatya\"). Stated differently, the Two Truths Doctrine holds that truth exists in conventional and ultimate forms, and that both forms are co-existent. Other schools, such as Dzogchen, hold that the Two Truths Doctrine are ultimately resolved into nonduality as a lived experience and are non-different. The doctrine is an especially important element of Buddhism and was first expressed in complete modern form by Nagarjuna, who based it on the \"Kaccāyanagotta Sutta\".\n\nChristian philosopher William Lane Craig notes that the Bible typically uses the words true or truth in non-philosophical senses to indicate such qualities as fidelity, moral rectitude, and reality. However, it does sometimes use the word in the philosophical sense of veracity.\n\nSome Christians believe that other authorities are sources of doctrinal truth. Catholics believe that the Pope is infallible when pronouncing on certain, rather specific, matters of church doctrine.\n\nIn Christian Science, (not recognised as a Christian organization by the bulk of mainstream churches) Truth is God. \n\nThe magisterium of the Catholic Church is the church's authority or office to establish teachings. That authority is vested uniquely in the Pope and the bishops, under the premise that they are in communion with the correct and true teachings of the faith which is shown in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Sacred scripture and sacred tradition \"make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church\", and the magisterium is not independent of this, since \"all that it proposes for belief as being divinely revealed is derived from this single deposit of faith.\"\n\nBiblical inerrancy, as formulated in the \"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\", is the doctrine that the Protestant Bible \"is without error or fault in all its teaching\"; or, at least, that \"Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact\". Various interpretations have been applied, depending on the tradition. According to some interpretations of the doctrine, \"all\" of the Bible is without error, i.e., is to be taken as true, no matter what the issue. Other interpretations hold that the Bible is always true on important matters of faith, while other interpretations hold that the Bible is true but must be specifically interpreted in the context of the language, culture and time that relevant passages were written.\n\nGenerally, truthfulness relates to speech: to speak only what one has seen, heard or understood, however the essence of truthfulness is far deeper in Hinduism: it is defined as upholding the central concept of righteousness. In the Upanishads of ancient India, truth is \"Sat\" (pronounced Sah't), the One Reality and Existence, which is directly experienced when the vision is cleared of dross. The Rishi discovers what exists, \"Sat\", as the truth of one's own Being, the Self or \"Atma\", and as the truth of the Being of God, Ishvara. In this usage, the term truth is used to refer to not merely a derived quality \"true rather than false\", but the true state of being, truth as what really is there. This is described by Ramana Maharshi: \"There is no greater mystery than that we keep seeking reality, though, in fact, we are reality.\"\n\nAlthough, historically, Jain authors have adopted different views on truth, the most prevalent is the system of \"anekantavada\" or \"not-one-sidedness\". This idea of truth is rooted in the notion that there is one truth, but only enlightened beings can perceive it in its entirety; unenlightened beings perceive only one side of the truth (\"ekanta\"). \"Anekantavada\" works around the limitations of a one-sided view of truth by proposing multiple vantage points (\"nayas\") from which truth can be viewed (cf. \"Nayavāda\"). Recognizing that there are multiple possible truths about any particular thing, even mutually exclusive truths, Jain philosophers developed a system for synthesizing these various claims, known as \"syadvada\". Within the system of \"syadvada\", each truth is qualified to its particular view-point; that is \"in a certain way\", one claim or another or both may be true.\n\nThere is no unilateral agreement among the different denominations of Judaism concerning truth. In Orthodox Judaism, truth is the revealed word of God, as found in the Hebrew Bible, and to a lesser extent, in the words of the sages of the Talmud. For Hasidic Jews truth is also found in the pronouncements of their rebbe, or spiritual leader, who is believed to possess divine inspiration. Kotzk, a Polish Hasidic sect, was known for their obsession with truth.\n\nIn Conservative Judaism, truth is not defined as literally as it is among the Orthodox. While Conservative Judaism acknowledges the truth of the Tanakh, generally, it does not accord that status to every single statement or word contained therein, as do the Orthodox. Moreover, unlike Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism believes that the nature of truth can vary from generation to generation, depending on circumstances. For instance, with respect to \"halakha\", or Jewish law, Conservative Judaism believes that it can be modified or adapted depending on the needs of the people. In Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, the \"halakha\" is fixed (by the sages of the Talmud and later authorities); the present-day task, therefore, is to interpret the \"halakha\", but not to change it.\n\nReform Judaism takes a much more liberal approach to truth. It does not hold that truth is found only in the Tanakh; rather, there are kernels of truth to be found in practically every religious tradition. Moreover, its attitude towards the Tanakh is, at best, a document parts of which may have been inspired, but with no particular monopoly on truth, or in any way legally binding.\n\n"}
{"id": "2112397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2112397", "title": "Sanctions (law)", "text": "Sanctions (law)\n\nSanctions, in law and legal definition, are penalties or other means of enforcement used to provide incentives for obedience with the law, or with rules and regulations. Criminal sanctions can take the form of serious punishment, such as corporal or capital punishment, incarceration, or severe fines. Within the civil law context, sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a lawsuit or his/her attorney, for violating rules of procedure, or for abusing the judicial process. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the involuntary dismissal, with prejudice, of a complaining party's cause of action, or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an appeal or trial \"de novo\" may be allowed because of reversible error.\n\nAs a noun, the term is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a judge fines a party, it is not said that he or she imposed a sanction, but that he or she imposed sanctions.\n\nA judge may sanction a party during a legal proceeding, by which it is implied that he or she imposes penalties. In the United States federal court system, certain types of conduct are sanctionable under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nConversely and sometimes confusingly, the word may be used to imply \"approve of,\" especially in an official sense. \"The law sanctions such behavior\" would imply that the behavior spoken of enjoys the specific approval of law.\n\nTo sanction implies make a legal agreement. The word is derived from sanctus, to make holy. A legal agreement or sanction imposes approvals, rules, guidelines and penalties on conduct.\n\nThe Sanction is defined as \"an element associated with an accountability and which corresponds to the consequence resulting from the justification of the realisation (or not) of this accountability.\".\n\n"}
{"id": "16924866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16924866", "title": "Self-brand", "text": "Self-brand\n\nThroughout the long history of consumer research, there has been much interest regarding how consumers choose which brand to buy and why they continue to purchase these brands. Self-branding describes the process in which consumers match their own self-concept with the images of a certain brand.\n\nPeople engaged in consumption do not merely buy certain products to satisfy basic needs. In fact, consumer buying habits are at a much deeper level. Owning a certain brand can help consumers to express and build their own self-concept. Specifically, consumers will often only purchase certain trademarks when he/she finds a match between the brand image (communicated through advertisement, design of retail shop, or even package design) and his/her own self-concept. Thereby, the value of a brand also depends of its ability to help consumer to build and create self-concept.\n\nThe above explanation for self-branding can be summarized by Sirgy's self-congruity theory. It is proposed that consumer behavior is partially determined by the similarity between consumers' psychological comparisons of the brand-user-image. This self-congruity affects consumption behavior of consumers through motives such as need for self-consistency (e.g. \"I am a good student because I work hard to prepare for examinations and I always get good grades\") and self-esteem. On the other hand, high self-congruity occurs when the consumers find appropriate match between their own self-image and the brand-image. Only high self-congruity would help consumers maintain and enhance self in a positive direction. Further from the above notions, high self-congruity will lead to positive attitudes towards the brand and repeated purchase.\n\nBesides assisting consumer to choose which product and brand to buy, the matching process between self-concept and image of brand and product also determines how consumers evaluate the brand and product. When we say that a brand has a positive brand-image, it means that the brand has established some strong, favorable and unique associations with the consumer's self-image (e.g. iPods have a strong and explicit image of being trendy, fashionable and high-tech, a combination of brand image that is unique and valued by young people). These strong, favorable and unique associations can be mainly divided into two parts. They are image of users and the psychological benefits experienced by the users in buying this particular brand or product. Firstly, image of users means that when consumer evaluate the brand they will image the typical user of this particular brand and see whether they are similar to the typical user. Demographic and psychological profile of the typical user is usually a good source of information for consumer to make these comparisons. (e.g. if someone perceived themselves as a trendy youngster and valued advanced technology, the chance that they will buy an iPod for their own use is very high). Secondly, psychological benefits experienced by consumers include increase recognition by the peer group (i.e. social approval) and expression of how one would like other people to see and think of oneself (i.e. personal expression).\n\nWhen the set of brand associations are linked or connected to the self, these associations can help consumers achieve certain goals. These goals include what they might become, what they would like to become, and what they are afraid of becoming. People are motivated to create a favorable and consistent self-identity based on self-enhancement (i.e. people over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of themselves) self-verification (i.e. people want to be known and understood by others according to their firmly held beliefs and feelings about themselves respectively).\n\nIn self-enhancement, the impressions individuals hold about themselves are often biased towards a positive direction. Therefore, they over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of self. People use brand to represent favorable self-images to others or to themselves.\n\nThe first aspect in self-enhancement is the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem. Another aspect is about social interaction (e.g. staff meetings). In terms of impression management, people actively manage their presentation (e.g. the brand of garment) in front of other people so as to maximize the opportunity to gain positive feedback. On the other hand, people are also motivated to create a good impression (e.g. wearing a watch of big brand) in order to gain social approval and intrinsic satisfaction. This is especially true when the person has very high self-esteem.\n\nSelf-verification refers to seek accurate information about self. In general, people seek and interpret situations and behavioral strategies that match their present self-conceptions. In contrast, they avoid situations and behaviors that derive contradictory information.\n\nSelf-verification can be achieved by two primary strategies. The first strategy is seeing more self-confirmatory evidence than actually exists. The second strategy is striving to affect the reactions of other people by developing a self-confirmatory environment, which includes displaying identity cues such as driving a certain brand of automobile.\n\nIt is found that people choose products and brand by imagining the prototypical users for each item in the choice set and choosing the items that maximizes their similarity to a desired prototypical user.\n\nIt seems that it is incompatible to seek feedback that is favorable (self-enhancement) and at the same time seek accurate feedback regardless of favorability (self-verification). Social psychology shows that there are factors affecting the relative degree to which each feedback satisfied, e.g. cognitive resources, stable versus malleable aspects of personality, intuitive-experiential versus analytical-rational modes of thought, or cognitive versus affective processes. More specifically, it is found that people with high self-esteem, high self-monitors (i.e. regulate their own behavior in order to \"look good\"), narcissists (i.e. self-love), and Type B personalities (i.e. patient, relaxed, and easy-going) are more likely than their counterparts to be influenced by self-enhancement motives as opposed to self-verification motives.\n\nYouTube has become an increasingly popular platform for self-branding. As self-branding is known for its strategic placement of oneself through a media outlet, it is a commonplace for many individuals to post videos, clips, tutorials, and other visual aides under their channels. YouTube especially gives the individual the opportunity to upload and control the information that is distributed on themselves – as they are the ones creating, editing, and uploading the content. By controlling the information being displayed on their channels, it is possible to promote and market themselves on a wider scale as YouTube has millions cross paths with their site daily. Through self-branding, developing one's self is not the only aspect of this self-marketing tactic. There is also the aspect of \"authenticity\" to validate their specialties, and also a \"business-targeted self presentation\". This can be done through addressing the proper credentials or years of practice that has past throughout their practice of the topic or talent they relate themselves to.\n\nThe concept of self-branding a product can be seen particularly in the case of physical exercise gurus, beauty gurus, health gurus, food expert, and other gurus as well. This concept can be seen in the successful Michelle Phan, who is a beauty guru on YouTube. Michelle Phan has a record of revealing intimate facts about her life through interviews, blogs, and YouTube videos. On her website michellephan.com, she has created an \"about me\" section to further her self-branding in efforts to give a brief introduction about herself and her passion for beauty related topics, tips, and advice. She states, \"I'm passionate about being a makeup artist and teaching others how to look and feel fabulous in their own skin\". She also claims to help women raise their self-esteem and confidence levels. This is all done through \"a safe space where makeup enthusiasts, fashion lovers, trendsetters, and beauty aficionados alike, can find inspiration, how-to advice, style news, easy DIY ideas, and tips\".\n\nYouTube gurus like Michelle Phan carry an image and a created identity. In an interview with fashionista.com, Michelle Phan stated that success in the blogging and video industry has to do with sending a message, vision, and brand identity. She has said to be cautious of what she is affiliated with, as it can affect the relationship she has formed with her followers. Through presenting an identity through her YouTube channel, she and other YouTube gurus alike have launched their own products. For instance, Michelle Phan has created a line of cosmetics that include eye shadows, lipsticks, eyeliners, foundation, contour sticks, concealer, and other forms of makeup that are related to the content she chooses to upload on her personal YouTube channel. Michelle Phan's ability to self-brand through media such as YouTube gives her a competitive advantage. YouTube reports that \"more than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month\". It also states \"over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube\". Michelle Phan's channel is one of the channels YouTube claims is among the \"thousands of channels that are making six figures a year\".\n\nIn the process of consumer socialization, self-brand connections develop throughout childhood as a result of developmental changes. Major changes occur in the representation of self-concepts between early childhood and adolescence. As children grow older, they conceptualize the self in less concrete and more abstract terms. For example, a concrete thinker can recognize that John likes clothes; more abstract thinker can reflect on emotions, like affection. Self-concepts become more complex as children mature, with a greater variety of self-constructs used to describe the self. In the Dixon and Street (1975) study, possessions were not part of self-concept descriptions for 6- to 8-year-olds but surfaced and increased in importance from 8 to 16 years of age.\n\nChildren recognize brand at an early age, as young as 3 or 4 years of age. John and Sujan (1990) found that children 4–7 years of age used perceptual cues (shape, package color), whereas older children (8–10 years) used no observable conceptual cues (taste) as a basis for classifying products. They, in middle childhood (7–8 years of age) can name multiple brand products and request products by brand name. Their comparisons of the self-concept with brand take place on a concrete level that self-brand connections are straightforward in nature. For example, self-brand connections might be made on the basis of simply being familiar with or owning a brand.\n\nLate childhood (10–12 years of age) begin heightened appreciation for subtle meanings imbedded in brand images converges with a trend toward defining the self in more abstract and complex terms. Brands gain recognition as useful devices for characterizing the self in terms of personality traits, user characteristics, and reference groups.\n\nAs children move into adolescence, children have deeper self-brand connections because they think about brand in a very specific way—as having personalities and symbolizing group membership—that provides a natural link to their self-concepts. A greater understanding of the self, combined with social pressures to \"fit in\" and signal group membership, leads adolescents to be more vigilant about the social implications of owning certain brand. As a result, adolescents possess an even larger number of self-brand connections, which may be even more complex in nature.\n\nAs mentioned in the social comparison theory proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in 1954, humans have a drive to evaluate themselves by examining their opinions and abilities in comparison to others. Consumers often use the images of other brands' users as a source of information for evaluating their own beliefs and perceptions about their own and others' social identities. They also actively construct self-concept using brand associations that arise through reference group.\n\nIn many consumer researches, reference group is a key concept for demonstrating the congruency between group membership and brand usage. It refers to the social groups that are important to a consumer and against which he/she compares oneself. With different personal goals, individuals would take different types of reference groups. For example, if someone would like to verify his own current social identities, he tends to compare himself with a 'member group', to which it supposes he belongs to. For example, if a person considers himself to be intellectual and his member group of intellectuals tends to drive a Volvos, he may choose to drive Volvo too. Similarly, an 'aspiration group' is another type of reference group to which an individual aspires to belong. If a consumer wishes to be more hip, and he sees hip people wearing Versace clothing, he may choose to wear Versace clothing in an attempt to appropriate the hip associations of that brand.\n\nOn the marketing level, companies gain an enduring competitive advantage by utilizing the association between brand and self-concept. This type of association is difficult for competitors to imitate. For example, in a sport consumption context, when consumer fans identify with the team (i.e., a branded organization) and rally together in expectation of victory, the team image is emphasized.\n\nOn the individual level, brand symbolism provides moderation effects for in-group and out-group association. For in-groups, a symbolic brand has a stronger communicating effect than a non-symbolic brand; for out-groups, only a symbolic brand used to differentiate one from out-group.\n"}
{"id": "294793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294793", "title": "Sensory deprivation", "text": "Sensory deprivation\n\nSensory deprivation or perceptual isolation is the deliberate reduction or removal of stimuli from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank).\n\nShort-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to meditation; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme anxiety, hallucinations, bizarre thoughts, temporary senselessness, and depression.\n\nA related phenomenon is perceptual deprivation, also called the Ganzfeld effect. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.\n\nSensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within NATO, as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the use of the five techniques by British security forces in Northern Ireland amounted to a practice of inhumane and degrading treatment.\n\nThere are two basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST): chamber REST and flotation REST.\n\nIn chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound-reducing (on average, 80 dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing.\nChamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes.\n\nIn flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and Epsom salts at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires \"major deliberate effort.\" Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.\n\nFor the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha brain waves to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced creativity and problem solving. Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress. The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of cortisol, and maximal blood flow. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.\n\nSeveral differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on hypertonic muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.\n\nAlso, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST.\nAdditionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia.\n\nNumerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat smoking, obesity, alcohol intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.\nHowever, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours).\n\nThe use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: behavior modification) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a nicotine patch alone has a success rate of 5%.\n\nAlcoholism has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the placebo effect.\n\nIn addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean.\n\nStudies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures psychosis-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing hallucinations of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a \"presence of evil\" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations.\nMany studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren't directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations. \n\nSchizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.\nAccording to a 2009 study published in the \"Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease,\" the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called faulty source monitoring.\nA study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provides a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events. \n\nThe five techniques of \"wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink\" were used by the security forces in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the interrogation of paramilitary suspects.\n\nThe Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the European Commission of Human Rights (\"Ireland v. United Kingdom\", 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it \"considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture.\" This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) examined the United Nations' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques \"did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture,\" however they did amount \"to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment,\" which is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 3.\n\nIt their judgment the court states that:\n\nJosé Padilla, a United States citizen from Brooklyn, New York, was convicted in federal court of aiding terrorists in 2007 and was sentenced to 17 years and 4 months in prison. While awaiting trial, reports surfaced that, to persuade him to reveal information, he was subjected to sensory deprivation for weeks at a time. For 1,307 days, Padilla was kept in a 9' x 7' cell with no natural light, clock or calendar. When Padilla left his cell, he was shackled and fitted with heavy goggles and headphones. His counsel argues that while he was being interrogated Padilla was subjected to harsh lights and pounding sounds. While meeting with his counsel, they reported Padilla exhibiting facial tics, random eye movements and unusual contortions of his body. According to them, Padilla had become so \"shattered\" that he became convinced his lawyers were part of a continuing interrogation program and saw his captors as protectors.\n\nIn January 2008, the BBC aired a \"Horizon\" special entitled \"Total Isolation\". The premise of the show centered on six individuals, four men and two women, agreeing to be shut in a cell inside a nuclear bunker, alone and in complete darkness for 48 hours. Prior to isolation, the volunteers underwent tests of visual memory, information processing, verbal fluency and suggestibility.\n\nAfter the two days and two nights, the subjects noted that their inability to sense time, as well as hallucinations, made the experience difficult. Of the six volunteers, three experienced auditory and visual hallucinations—snakes, oysters, tiny cars and zebras. One was convinced their sheets were wet. Two seemed to cope well.\n\nWhen complete, the tests that the subjects took before the experiment were conducted a second time to test its effects. The results indicated all volunteers' ability to complete the simplest tasks had deteriorated. One subject's memory capacity fell 36% and all the subjects had trouble thinking of words beginning with a nominated letter; in this case, the letter \"F\". All four of the men had markedly increased suggestibility, although this was not the case with the women.\n\"It's really hard to stimulate your brain with no light. It's blanking me. I can feel my brain just not wanting to do anything.\"\n\n— Adam Bloom (volunteer subject) — \"Total Isolation\"\n\n\n\n"}

It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.\n\nJacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of \"laïcité\" and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission. During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as Cardinal Lustiger, intellectuals such as Régis Debray and Patrick Weil as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the Ni Putes Ni Soumises).\n\nThe commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the hijab in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.\n\nIn response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.\n\nThe report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and freedom of thought particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.\n\nThe Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or reasonable accommodation into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State.\n"}

The major reason for the use of superadditive sequences is the following lemma due to Michael Fekete.\n\nLemma: (Fekete) For every superadditive sequence { \"a\" }, \"n\" ≥ 1, the limit lim \"a\"/\"n\" exists and is equal to sup \"a\"/\"n\". (The limit may be positive infinity, for instance, for the sequence \"a\" = log \"n\"<nowiki>!</nowiki>.)\n\nSimilarly, a function \"f\" is \"superadditive\" if\n\nfor all \"x\" and \"y\" in the domain of \"f\".\n\nFor example, formula_3 is a superadditive function for nonnegative real numbers because the square of formula_4 is always greater than or equal to the square of formula_5 plus the square of formula_6, for nonnegative real numbers formula_5 and formula_6.\n\nThe analogue of Fekete's lemma holds for subadditive functions as well.\nThere are extensions of Fekete's lemma that do not require the definition of superadditivity above to hold for all \"m\" and \"n\". There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete's lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and subadditivity is present. A good exposition of this topic may be found in Steele (1997).\n\nIf \"f\" is a superadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then \"f\"(0) ≤ 0.

Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online swishes take place.\n\nSwishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model Twiggy in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.\n\nA Swishing Party usually has a Swishing Host who lays out guests' items at the venue after the guests have arrived. The Host sends one group of guests to look at the items while other groups wait or do an activity. When an allocated amount of time has passed, the groups rotate. When all guests have seen the items, the Host places everyone's name into a hat or bowl and draws them one at a time; when a guest's name is called, he or she claims an item. The Host waits for only a few seconds before calling out the next name. The remainder of the items are them donated to charity by the Host.\n\nThere are several types of variations. If the Swish is for charity, attendees have their names placed into the bowl along with an extra amount for a donation; Swishes can be focused on specific items like clothes, crockery, shoes, handbags, and accessories; they can be held for family, friends, or workmates; they can be less orderly, as a free-for-all instead of a drawing by name.\n\n"}

{"id": "45635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45635", "title": "Top-down and bottom-up design", "text": "Top-down and bottom-up design\n\nTop-down and bottom-up are both strategies of information processing and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization. In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.\n\nA top-down approach (also known as \"stepwise design\" and in some cases used as a synonym of \"decomposition\") is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of \"black boxes\", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.\n\nA bottom-up approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of information processing based on incoming data from the environment to form a perception. From a cognitive psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the \"bottom\"), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is \"built up\" from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a \"seed\" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. However, \"organic strategies\" may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.\n\nDuring the design and development of new products, designers and engineers rely on both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is being utilized when off-the-shelf or existing components are selected and integrated into the product. An example would include selecting a particular fastener, such as a bolt, and designing the receiving components such that the fastener will fit properly. In a top-down approach, a custom fastener would be designed such that it would fit properly in the receiving components.\nFor perspective, for a product with more restrictive requirements (such as weight, geometry, safety, environment, etc.), such as a space-suit, a more top-down approach is taken and almost everything is custom designed. However, when it's more important to minimize cost and increase component availability, such as with manufacturing equipment, a more bottom-up approach would be taken, and as many off-the-shelf components (bolts, gears, bearings, etc.) would be selected as possible. In the latter case, the receiving housings would be designed around the selected components.\n\nIn the software development process, the top-down and bottom-up approaches play a key role.\n\nTop-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete. Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. This approach, however, runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought. Re-usability of code is one of the main benefits of the bottom-up approach.\n\nTop-down design was promoted in the 1970s by IBM researchers Harlan Mills and Niklaus Wirth. Mills developed structured programming concepts for practical use and tested them in a 1969 project to automate the \"New York Times\" morgue index. The engineering and management success of this project led to the spread of the top-down approach through IBM and the rest of the computer industry. Among other achievements, Niklaus Wirth, the developer of Pascal programming language, wrote the influential paper \"Program Development by Stepwise Refinement\". Since Niklaus Wirth went on to develop languages such as Modula and Oberon (where one could define a module before knowing about the entire program specification), one can infer that top-down programming was not strictly what he promoted. Top-down methods were favored in software engineering until the late 1980s, and object-oriented programming assisted in demonstrating the idea that both aspects of top-down and bottom-up programming could be utilized.\n\nModern software design approaches usually combine both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Although an understanding of the complete system is usually considered necessary for good design, leading theoretically to a top-down approach, most software projects attempt to make use of existing code to some degree. Pre-existing modules give designs a bottom-up flavor. Some design approaches also use an approach where a partially functional system is designed and coded to completion, and this system is then expanded to fulfill all the requirements for the project\n\nTop-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top–down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.\n\nIn a bottom-up approach, the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a \"seed\" model, by which the beginnings are small, but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs. In mechanical engineering with software programs such as Pro/ENGINEER, Solidworks, and Autodesk Inventor users can design products as pieces not part of the whole and later add those pieces together to form assemblies like building with Lego. Engineers call this piece part design.\n\nIn a bottom-up approach, good intuition is necessary to decide the functionality that is to be provided by the module. If a system is to be built from an existing system, this approach is more suitable as it starts from some existing modules.\n\nParsing is the process of analyzing an input sequence (such as that read from a file or a keyboard) in order to determine its grammatical structure. This method is used in the analysis of both natural languages and computer languages, as in a compiler.\n\nBottom-up parsing is a strategy for analyzing unknown data relationships that attempts to identify the most fundamental units first, and then to infer higher-order structures from them. Top-down parsers, on the other hand, hypothesize general parse tree structures and then consider whether the known fundamental structures are compatible with the hypothesis. See Top-down parsing and Bottom-up parsing.\n\nTop-down and bottom-up are two approaches for the manufacture of products. These terms were first applied to the field of nanotechnology by the Foresight Institute in 1989 in order to distinguish between molecular manufacturing (to mass-produce large atomically precise objects) and conventional manufacturing (which can mass-produce large objects that are not atomically precise). Bottom-up approaches seek to have smaller (usually molecular) components built up into more complex assemblies, while top-down approaches seek to create nanoscale devices by using larger, externally controlled ones to direct their assembly. Certain valuable nanostructures, such as Silicon nanowires, can be fabricated using either approach, with processing methods selected on the basis of targeted applications.\n\nThe top-down approach often uses the traditional workshop or microfabrication methods where externally controlled tools are used to cut, mill, and shape materials into the desired shape and order. Micropatterning techniques, such as photolithography and inkjet printing belong to this category. Vapor treatment can be regarded as a new top-down secondary approaches to engineer nanostructures.\n\nBottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the chemical properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to (a) self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or (b) rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or molecular recognition. See also Supramolecular chemistry. Such bottom-up approaches should, broadly speaking, be able to produce devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.\n\nThese terms are also employed in neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology to discuss the flow of information in processing. Typically sensory input is considered \"bottom-up\", and higher cognitive processes, which have more information from other sources, are considered \"top-down\". A bottom-up process is characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing, whereas a top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition, such as goals or targets (Beiderman, 19).\n\nAccording to college teaching notes written by Charles Ramskov, Rock, Neiser, and Gregory claim that top-down approach involves perception that is an active and constructive process. Additionally, it is an approach not directly given by stimulus input, but is the result of stimulus, internal hypotheses, and expectation interactions. According to Theoretical Synthesis, \"when a stimulus is presented short and clarity is uncertain that gives a vague stimulus, perception becomes a top-down approach.\"\n\nConversely, psychology defines bottom-up processing as an approach wherein there is a progression from the individual elements to the whole. According to Ramskov, one proponent of bottom-up approach, Gibson, claims that it is a process that includes visual perception that needs information available from proximal stimulus produced by the distal stimulus. Theoretical Synthesis also claims that bottom-up processing occurs \"when a stimulus is presented long and clearly enough.\"\n\nCognitively speaking, certain cognitive processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, are considered bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas processes such as motor control and directed attention are considered top-down because they are goal directed. Neurologically speaking, some areas of the brain, such as area V1 mostly have bottom-up connections. Other areas, such as the fusiform gyrus have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.\n\nThe study of visual attention provides an example. If your attention is drawn to a flower in a field, it may be because the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent upon knowledge of the flower; the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which you are looking for a flower. You have a representation of what you are looking for. When you see the object you are looking for, it is salient. This is an example of the use of top-down information.\n\nIn cognitive terms, two thinking approaches are distinguished. \"Top-down\" (or \"big chunk\") is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. \"Bottom-up\" (or \"small chunk\") cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression \"seeing the wood for the trees\" references the two styles of cognition.\n\nIn the fields of management and organization, the terms \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" are used to describe how decisions are made and/or how change is implemented.\n\nA \"top-down\" approach is where an executive decision maker or other top person makes the decisions of how something should be done. This approach is disseminated under their authority to lower levels in the hierarchy, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, bound by them. For example, when wanting to make an improvement in a hospital, a hospital administrator might decide that a major change (such as implementing a new program) is needed, and then the leader uses a planned approach to drive the changes down to the frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).\n\nA \"bottom-up\" approach to changes is one that works from the grassroots—from a large number of people working together, causing a decision to arise from their joint involvement. A decision by a number of activists, students, or victims of some incident to take action is a \"bottom-up\" decision. A bottom-up approach can be thought of as \"an incremental change approach that represents an emergent process cultivated and upheld primarily by frontline workers\" (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015, p. 241).\n\nPositive aspects of top-down approaches include their efficiency and superb overview of higher levels. Also, external effects can be internalized. On the negative side, if reforms are perceived to be imposed 'from above', it can be difficult for lower levels to accept them (e.g. Bresser-Pereira, Maravall, and Przeworski 1993). Evidence suggests this to be true regardless of the content of reforms (e.g. Dubois 2002). A bottom-up approach allows for more experimentation and a better feeling for what is needed at the bottom. Other evidence suggests that there is a third combination approach to change (see Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).\n\nBoth top-down and bottom-up approaches exist in public health. There are many examples of top-down programs, often run by governments or large inter-governmental organizations (IGOs); many of these are disease-specific or issue-specific, such as HIV control or Smallpox Eradication. Examples of bottom-up programs include many small NGOs set up to improve local access to healthcare. However, a lot of programs seek to combine both approaches; for instance, guinea worm eradication, a single-disease international program currently run by the Carter Center has involved the training of many local volunteers, boosting bottom-up capacity, as have international programs for hygiene, sanitation, and access to primary health-care.\n\nOften, the École des Beaux-Arts school of design is said to have primarily promoted top-down design because it taught that an architectural design should begin with a parti, a basic plan drawing of the overall project.\n\nBy contrast, the Bauhaus focused on bottom-up design. This method manifested itself in the study of translating small-scale organizational systems to a larger, more architectural scale (as with the woodpanel carving and furniture design).\n\nIn ecology, top-down control refers to when a top predator controls the structure or population dynamics of the ecosystem. The classic example is of kelp forest ecosystems. In such ecosystems, sea otters are a keystone predator. They prey on urchins which in turn eat kelp. When otters are removed, urchin populations grow and reduce the kelp forest creating urchin barrens. In other words, such ecosystems are not controlled by productivity of the kelp but rather a top predator.\n\nBottom-up control in ecosystems refers to ecosystems in which the nutrient supply and productivity and type of primary producers (plants and phytoplankton) control the ecosystem structure. An example would be how plankton populations are controlled by the availability of nutrients. Plankton populations tend to be higher and more complex in areas where upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.\n\nThere are many different examples of these concepts. It is common for populations to be influenced by both types of control.\n\n\n\n\n"}
