They are therefore often also referred to as aeroacoustic analogies.\n\nIn general, aeroacoustic analogies are derived from the compressible Navier–Stokes equations (NSE). The compressible NSE are rearranged into various forms of the inhomogeneous acoustic wave equation. Within these equations, source terms describe the acoustic sources. They consist of pressure and speed fluctuation as well as stress tensor and force terms.\n\nApproximations are introduced to make the source terms independent of the acoustic variables. In this way, linearized equations are derived which describe the propagation of the acoustic waves in a homogeneous, resting medium. The latter is excited by the acoustic source terms, which are determined from the turbulent fluctuations. Since the aeroacoustics are described by the equations of classical acoustics, the methods are called aeroacoustic analogies.\n\nThe Lighthill analogy considers a free flow, as for example with an engine jet. The nonstationary fluctuations of the stream are represented by a distribution of quadrupole sources in the same volume.\n\nThe Curle analogy is a formal solution of the Lighthill analogy, which takes hard surfaces into consideration.\n\nThe Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings analogy is valid for aeroacoustic sources in relative motion with respect to a hard surface, as is the case in many technical applications for example in the automotive industry or in air travel. The calculation involves quadrupole, dipole and monopole terms.\n\n"}

But the term is used particularly in the study of legends, folk tales and oral literature for works that have features in common either because they derive from a shared tradition or because they both rework material from a specific older text, which may or may not still survive.\n\nFor example, some claim the story of Noah and the Flood in the Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh are analogues.\n\nHowever, where one work draws directly on another, the term \"analogue\" is inappropriate: the earlier work is the \"source\" of the later.\n\nIn the literature of earlier periods, it may not be easy to decide whether a particular work is a direct source for another, especially if there are uncertainties of dating.

They are often broader in scope than the theories of value of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, etc. usually including sociological, political, institutional, and historical perspectives (transdisciplinarity). Some have influenced feminist economics.\n\nThe basic premise is that economic activities can only be fully understood in the context of the society that creates them. The concept of \"value\" is a social construct, and as such is defined by the culture using the concept. Yet we can gain some insights into modern patterns of exchange, value, and wealth by examining previous societies. An anthropological approach to economic processes allows us to critically examine the cultural biases inherent in the principles of modern economics. Anthropological linguistics is a related field that looks at the terms we use to describe economic relations and the ecologies they are set within. Many anthropological economists (or economic anthropologists) are reacting against what they see as the portrayal of modern society as an economic machine that merely produces and consumes.\n\nMarcel Mauss and Bronisław Malinowski for example wrote about objects that circulate in society without being consumed. Georges Bataille wrote about objects that are destroyed, but not consumed. Bruce Owens talks about objects of value that are neither circulating nor consumed (e.g. gold reserves, warehoused paintings, family heirlooms).\n\nDavid Graeber attempts to synthesize the insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss. He sees value as a model for human meaning-making. Starting with Marxist definitions of consumption and production, he introduces Mauss's idea of \"objects that are not consumed\" and posits that the majority of human behavior consists of activities that would not be properly categorized as either consumption or production.\n\nA list of things that are neither consumption nor production in 2003 includes those human activities that are not consumption, in the narrow sense of simply purchasing something, and are not production, in the sense of creating or modifying something intended for sale or exchange, namely:\nEconomists typically use the term consumption in a way that is far broader than merely purchasing something. It is quite common to talk about the consumption of time. Many of the items on this list can still be considered either production or consumption, or to involve production or consumption at some stage to be accomplished. For example, cooking a meal is production of food for someone's consumption, and it involves consuming (cooking) raw materials previously purchased or gathered; and, writing is production of material for someone to consume through reading. Both of these activities are often done for some return in value, whether it is for respect or monetary payment. In a similar way, some of these items are replacements for consumption – for example, rather than purchase a meal, you can cook the meal yourself. In cooking the meal, you have now in effect paid for the meal with your own labor rather than earning wages and paying for a meal with those wages. In this way, economists, and in general anyone, could view this list as containing nothing that is not consumption or production, other than possibly turning around in a circle, though this involves consuming calories that would, at some point, have been consumed. For example, even window shoppers are consuming – the product is marketers’ production (specifically in this case, the window dresser's creation). Possibly, only in death are we neither consuming nor producing, but merely being consumed, though it could be argued that one's body is consuming space, particularly in a cemetery plot (real estate), but even if cremated and scattered. Gary Becker's household production functions and similar topics note that people often purchase goods and then combine them with time to produce something that has meaning or practicality to them (which produce utility).\n\n"}
{"id": "27954947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27954947", "title": "Apeiron", "text": "Apeiron\n\nApeiron (; ) is a Greek word meaning \"(that which is) unlimited,\" \"boundless\", \"infinite\", or \"indefinite\" from \"a-\", \"without\" and \"peirar\", \"end, limit\", \"boundary\", the Ionic Greek form of \"peras\", \"end, limit, boundary\". It is akin to Persian \"piramon\", meaning \"boundary, circumference, surrounding\".\n\nThe \"apeiron\" is central to the cosmological theory created by Anaximander, a 6th-century BC pre-Socratic Greek philosopher whose work is mostly lost. From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (\"arche\") is eternal and infinite, or boundless (\"apeiron\"), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. \"Apeiron\" generated the opposites (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world (cf. Heraclitus). Everything is generated from \"apeiron\" and then it is destroyed by going back to \"apeiron\", according to necessity. He believed that infinite worlds are generated from \"apeiron\" and then they are destroyed there again.\n\nHis ideas were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition and by his teacher Thales (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws. The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word \"nomos\" (law) may originally have meant \"natural law\" and used later to mean man-made law.\n\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted \"apeiron\" as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing mythical way of thought to the newer rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek city states during the 6th century BC.\n\nIn the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC) the first primordial god is Chaos, which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between Tartarus and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation). One can name it also abyss (having no bottom).\n\nAlternately, Greek philosopher Thales believed that the origin or first principle was water. Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BC) probably called the water also \"Chaos\" and this is not placed at the very beginning.\n\nIn the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology Enuma Elish describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in Genesis.\nIn the Hindu cosmogony which is similar to the Vedic (Hiranyagarbha) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.\n\nHesiod made an abstraction, because his original \"chaos\" is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in Homer (indefinite sea). A fragment from Xenophanes (6th century BC) shows the transition from \"chaos\" to \"apeiron\": \"The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)\". Either \"apeiron\" meant the \"spatial indefinite\" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration. His ideas may have been influenced by the Pythagoreans:\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making \"apeiron\" the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap between the existing \"mythical\" and the new \"rational\" way of thought (\"rationalism\"). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, water, air, fire, earth, which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod). Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.\n\nThere is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales: \"What is divine? What has no origin, nor end.\" This probably led his student to his final decision for \"apeiron\", because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"arche\" is called \"eternal and ageless\" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).\n\nThe \"apeiron\" has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.\nOut of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars. The first animals were generated in the water. When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish. The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.\n\nIn the commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle's \"Physics\" the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:\n\nThis fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms, meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess \"Justice\" (Dike), appears to keep the order. The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word \"dike\" (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour. The word \"adikia\" (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb \"law and order\" (\"eunomia\"). In Homer's \"Odyssey\" \"eunomia\" is contrasted with \"hubris\" (arrogance). Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a \"city-state\".\n\nAetius (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:\n\nTherefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about \"apeiron\" and this is also noticed by Aristotle:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including Martin Heidegger.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, noted for the creation of quantum mechanics, arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \"primordial substance\". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague Max Born called this substance \"apeiron\".\n\nScholars in other fields, e.g. Bertrand Russell and Maurice Bowra, didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term \"apeiron\", but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.\n\nThere are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. \"Apeiron\" is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant \"nothingless\". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from \"apeiron\" must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.\n\nJustice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.\n\nWe may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with \"apeiron\" is metaphysical (and can lead to monism), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical. The same paradox existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (\"hubris\" or \"adikia\") could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (\"dike\") would destroy him to reestablish the order. These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers. Philolaus (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ( \"apeira\", plural of \"apeiron\") and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (\"apeiron\") and the limited. Something similar is mentioned by Plato: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.\n\nSome doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: \"God ordained that all men shall die\", \"Death is a common debt\". The Greek word \"adikia\" (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits hubris. The relative English word \"arrogance\" (claim as one's own without justification; ), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: \"Nothing in excess.\"\n\nOther pre-Socratic philosophers had different theories of the \"apeiron\". For the Pythagoreans (in particular, Philolaus), the universe had begun as an \"apeiron\", but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts. For Anaxagoras, the initial \"apeiron\" had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike \"Nous\" (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same \"apeiron\", all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.\n\n\n"}

Baroni served in the Senate on the Joint Committee on the Public Schools, the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee, the Wagering, Tourism & Historic Preservation Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He was also the only Republican state senator who voted for a 2010 measure to allow same-sex marriage in New Jersey. He supports same sex marriage in Ireland, of which he is also a citizen.\n\nBaroni was an associate at DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick & Cole, and then at Blank Rome. He was of counsel at Fornaro Francioso, a Hamilton firm. He served as chief counsel to Congressman Bob Franks in his 2000 U.S. Senate race. In 2002, when U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli withdrew his candidacy for re-election five weeks before Election Day after the Senate admonished him on ethics charges, Baroni argued for the Republicans in the New Jersey Supreme Court against a last-minute switch of candidates to Frank Lautenberg.\n\nSince 2002, Baroni has been an adjunct professor at the Seton Hall University School of Law, where he teaches classes on Professional Responsibility, voting rights, legislation, and campaign finance reform.

Bounded quantification is an interaction of parametric polymorphism with subtyping. Bounded quantification has traditionally been studied in the functional setting of System F, but is available in modern object-oriented languages supporting parametric polymorphism (generics) such as Java, C# and Scala.\n\nThe purpose of bounded quantification is to allow for polymorphic functions to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of type inheritance. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows to considers all objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic codice_1 function that considers all objects that are comparable to each other.\n\n\"F\"-bounded quantification or recursively bounded quantification, introduced in 1989, allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types. A recursive type is one that includes a function that uses it as a type for some argument or its return value.\n\nThis kind of type constraint can be expressed in Java with a generic interface. The following example demonstrates how to describe types that can be compared to each other and use this as typing information in polymorphic functions. The codice_2 function uses simple bounded quantification and does not preserve the type of the assigned types, in contrast with the codice_3 function which uses F-bounded quantification.\n\nIn mathematical notation, the types of the two functions are\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "945930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=945930", "title": "Cardinal virtues", "text": "Cardinal virtues\n\nFour cardinal virtues were recognized in classical antiquity and in traditional Christian theology:\nThese virtues derive initially from Plato's scheme, discussed in \"Republic\" Book IV, 426–435 (and see \"Protagoras\" 330b, which also includes piety (\"hosiotes\")). Cicero expanded on them, and Ambrose, Augustine of Hippo, and Thomas Aquinas adapted them while adding a set of theological virtues.\n\nThe term \"cardinal\" comes from the Latin (hinge); virtues are so called because they are regarded as the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. They also relate to the Quadrivium.\n\nThe four cardinal virtues appear as a group (sometimes included in larger lists) long before they are later given this title.\n\nPlato identified the four cardinal virtues with the classes of the city described in \"The Republic\", and with the faculties of man. Plato narrates a discussion of the character of a good city where the following is agreed upon. “Clearly, then, it will be wise, brave, temperate [literally: healthy-minded], and just.” (427e; see also 435b) Temperance was common to all classes, but primarily associated with the producing classes, the farmers and craftsmen, and with the animal appetites, to whom no special virtue was assigned; fortitude was assigned to the warrior class and to the spirited element in man; prudence to the rulers and to reason. Justice stands outside the class system and divisions of man, and rules the proper relationship among the three of them.\n\nPlato sometimes (e.g., \"Protagoras\" 349b; cf. 324e, 329c, 330b, 331a-c) lists holiness (\"hosiotes\", \"eusebeia\", \"aidos\") amongst the cardinal virtues. He especially associates holiness with justice, but leaves their precise relationship unexplained.\n\nIn Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" we read: “The forms of Virtue are justice, courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, prudence, wisdom.” (\"Rhetoric\" 1366b1)\n\nThe Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero (106–43 BC), like Plato, limits the list to four virtues: \nCicero discusses these further in \"De Officiis\" (I, V and following).\n\nThe Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius discusses these in Book V:12 of \"Meditations\" and views them as the \"goods\" that a person should identify in one's own mind, as opposed to \"wealth or things which conduce to luxury or prestige.\"\n\nThe cardinal virtues are listed in the Bible. The deuterocanonical book Wisdom of Solomon 8:7 reads, \"She [Wisdom] teaches temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life.\"\n\nThey are also found in the Biblical apocrypha. 4 Maccabees 1:18–19 relates: “Now the kinds of wisdom are right judgment, justice, courage, and self-control. Right judgment is supreme over all of these since by means of it reason rules over the emotions.”\n\nCatholic moral philosophy drew from all of these sources when developing its thought on the virtues.\n\nAmbrose (AD 330s–397) was the first to use the expression “cardinal virtues.” “And we know that there are four cardinal virtues temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude.” (\"Commentary on Luke\", V, 62)\n\nAugustine of Hippo, discussing the morals of the church, described them:\nThe \"cardinal\" virtues are not the same as the three theological virtues: Faith, Hope and Charity (Love), named in 1 Corinthians 13. \n\"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\"\nBecause of this reference, a group of seven attributes is sometimes listed by adding the four cardinal virtues (prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice) and three theological virtues (faith, hope, charity).\nTogether, they comprise what is known as the seven virtues. While the first four date back to Greek philosophers and were applicable to all people seeking to live moral lives, the \"theological virtues\" appear to be specific to Christians as written by Paul in The New Testament.\n\nEfforts to relate the cardinal and theological virtues differ. Augustine sees faith as coming under justice. Beginning with a wry comment about the moral mischief of pagan deities, he writes:\nLater, in the High Middle Ages, some authors opposed the seven virtues (cardinal plus theological) to the seven capital sins. However, “treatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.” and “examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.” And there are problems with this parallelism.\nJesuit scholars Daniel Harrington and James Keenan in their \"Paul and Virtue Ethics\" (2010) argue for seven \"new virtues\" to replace the classical cardinal virtues in complementing the three theological virtues, listed as \"be humble, be hospitable, be merciful, be faithful, reconcile, be vigilant, and be reliable,\" although they don't explain why it has to be an either/or matter of replacing the cardinal virtues rather than supplementing them.\n\nThe Cardinal Virtues are often depicted as female allegorical figures and were a popular subject for funerary sculpture. The attributes and names of these figures may vary according to local tradition.\n\nIn many churches and artwork the Cardinal Virtues are depicted with symbolic items:\n\n\nNotable depictions include sculptures on the tomb of Francis II, Duke of Brittany and the tomb of John Hotham. They were also depicted in the garden at Edzell Castle.\n\nA humorous depiction of the four cardinal virtues appears in the children's book \"Masterpiece\" written by Elise Broach and illustrated by Kelly Murphy.\n\nAllegories of the virtues on the facade of the Gesuati church in Venice (1737)\nAllegories of the virtues on the facade of La Rochelle city hall\n\n\n"}

Research indicates that genetic factors predominate. The heritability of autism, however, is complex, and it is typically unclear which genes are responsible. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects. Many other causes have been proposed, such as childhood immunizations, but numerous epidemiological studies have shown no scientific evidence supporting any link between vaccinations and autism.\n\nAutism involves atypical brain development which often becomes apparent in behavior and social development before a child is three years old. It can be characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted interests and stereotyped behavior, and the characterization is independent of any underlying neurological defects. Other characteristics include repetitive-like tasks seen in their behavior and sensory interests. This article uses the terms \"autism\" and \"ASD\" to denote classical autism and the wider dispersion of symptoms and manifestations of autism, respectively.\n\nAutism's theory of causation is incomplete. It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion among researchers that autism does not have a single cause, but is instead a complex disorder with a set of core aspects that have distinct causes. Different underlying brain dysfunctions have been hypothesized to result in the common symptoms of autism, just as completely different brain problems result in intellectual disability. The terms \"autism\" or \"ASDs\" capture the wide range of disease processes at work. Although these distinct causes have been hypothesized to often co-occur, it has also been suggested that the correlation between the causes has been exaggerated. The number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, at least partly due to changes in diagnostic practice. It is unknown whether prevalence has increased as well.\n\nThe consensus among mainstream autism researchers is that genetic factors predominate. Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to autism or exacerbate its symptoms, or that may be important to consider in future research, include certain foods, infectious disease, heavy metals, solvents, diesel exhaust, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, and vaccines. Among these factors, vaccines have attracted much attention, as parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination, and parental concern about vaccines has led to a decreasing uptake of childhood immunizations and an increasing likelihood of measles outbreaks. However, there is overwhelming scientific evidence showing no causal association between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism, and there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine preservative thiomersal causes autism.\n\nGenetic factors may be the most significant cause for autism spectrum disorders. Early studies of twins had estimated heritability to be over 90%, meaning that genetics explains over 90% of whether a child will develop autism. However, this may be an overestimation, as new twin studies estimate the heritability at between 60–90%. Many of the non-autistic co-twins had learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings the risk for having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%.\n\nHowever, in spite of the strong heritability, most cases of ASD occur sporadically with no recent evidence of family history. It has been hypothesized that spontaneous \"de novo\" mutations in the father's sperm or mother's egg contribute to the likelihood of developing autism. There are two lines of evidence that support this hypothesis. First, individuals with autism have significantly reduced fecundity, they are 20 times less likely to have children than average, thus curtailing the persistence of mutations in ASD genes over multiple generations in a family. Second, the likelihood of having a child develop autism increases with advancing paternal age, and mutations in sperm gradually accumulate throughout a man's life.\n\nThe first genes to be definitively shown to contribute to risk for autism were found in the early 1990s by researchers looking at gender-specific forms of autism caused by mutations on the X chromosome.\nAn expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the promoter of the gene \"FMR1\" in boys causes fragile X syndrome, and at least 20% of boys with this mutation have behaviors consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Mutations that inactivate the gene \"MECP2\" cause Rett syndrome, which is associated with autistic behaviors in girls, and in boys the mutation is embryonic lethal.\n\nBesides these early examples, the role of \"de novo\" mutations in ASD first became evident when DNA microarray technologies reached sufficient resolution to allow the detection of copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome. CNVs are the most common type of structural variation in the genome, consisting of deletions and duplications of DNA that range in size from a kilobase to a few megabases. Microarray analysis has shown that \"de novo\" CNVs occur at a significantly higher rate in sporadic cases of autism as compared to the rate in their typically developing siblings and unrelated controls. A series of studies have shown that gene disrupting \"de novo\" CNVs occur approximately four times more frequently in ASD than in controls and contribute to approximately 5–10% of cases. Based on these studies, there are predicted to be 130–234 ASD-related CNV loci. The first whole genome sequencing study to comprehensively catalog \"de novo\" structural variation at a much higher resolution than DNA microarray studies has shown that the mutation rate is approximately 20% and not elevated in autism compared to sibling controls. However, structural variants in individuals with autism are much larger and four times more likely to disrupt genes, mirroring findings from CNV studies.\n\nCNV studies were closely followed by exome sequencing studies, which sequence the 1–2% of the genome that codes for proteins (the \"exome\"). These studies found that \"de novo\" gene inactivating mutations were observed in approximately 20% of individuals with autism, compared to 10% of unaffected siblings, suggesting the etiology of ASD is driven by these mutations in around 10% of cases. There are predicted to be 350-450 genes that significantly increase susceptibility to ASDs when impacted by inactivating \"de novo\" mutations. A further 12% of cases are predicted to be caused by protein altering missense mutations that change an amino acid but do not inactivate a gene. Therefore approximately 30% of individuals with autism have a spontaneous \"de novo\" large CNV that deletes or duplicates genes, or mutation that changes the amino acid code of an individual gene. A further 5–10% of cases have inherited structural variation at loci known to be associated with autism, and these known structural variants may arise \"de novo\" in the parents of affected children.\n\nTens of genes and CNVs have been definitively identified based on the observation of recurrent mutations in different individuals, and suggestive evidence has been found for over 100 others. The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) details the evidence for each genetic locus associated with autism.\n\nThese early gene and CNV findings have shown that the cognitive and behavioral features associated with each of the underlying mutations is variable. Each mutation is itself associated with a variety of clinical diagnoses, and can also be found in a small percentage of individuals with no clinical diagnosis. Thus the genetic disorders that comprise autism are not autism-specific. The mutations themselves are characterized by considerable variability in clinical outcome and typically only a subset of mutation carriers meet criteria for autism. This variable expressivity results in different individuals with the same mutation varying considerably in the severity of their observed particular trait.\n\nThe conclusion of these recent studies of \"de novo\" mutation is that the spectrum of autism is breaking up into quanta of individual disorders defined by genetics.\n\nEpigenetic mechanisms may increase the risk of autism. Epigenetic changes occur as a result not of DNA sequence changes but of chromosomal histone modification or modification of the DNA bases. Such modifications are known to be affected by environmental factors, including nutrition, drugs, and mental stress. Interest has been expressed in imprinted regions on chromosomes 15q and 7q.\n\nThe risk of autism is associated with several prenatal risk factors, including advanced age in either parent, diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. Autism has been linked to birth defect agents acting during the first eight weeks from conception, though these cases are rare.\n\nPrenatal viral infection has been called the principal non-genetic cause of autism. Prenatal exposure to rubella or cytomegalovirus activates the mother's immune response and may greatly increases the risk for autism in mice. Congenital rubella syndrome is the most convincing environmental cause of autism. Infection-associated immunological events in early pregnancy may affect neural development more than infections in late pregnancy, not only for autism, but also for psychiatric disorders of presumed neurodevelopmental origin, notably schizophrenia.\n\nTeratogens are environmental agents that cause birth defects. Some agents that are theorized to cause birth defects have also been suggested as potential autism risk factors, although there is little to no scientific evidence to back such claims. These include exposure of the embryo to valproic acid, paracetamol, thalidomide or misoprostol. These cases are rare. Questions have also been raised whether ethanol (grain alcohol) increases autism risk, as part of fetal alcohol syndrome or alcohol-related birth defects. All known teratogens appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.\n\nThyroid problems that lead to thyroxine deficiency in the mother in weeks 8–12 of pregnancy have been postulated to produce changes in the fetal brain leading to autism. Thyroxine deficiencies can be caused by inadequate iodine in the diet, and by environmental agents that interfere with iodine uptake or act against thyroid hormones. Possible environmental agents include flavonoids in food, tobacco smoke, and most herbicides. This hypothesis has not been tested.\n\nDiabetes in the mother during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for autism; a 2009 meta-analysis found that gestational diabetes was associated with a twofold increased risk. A 2014 review also found that maternal diabetes was significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD. Although diabetes causes metabolic and hormonal abnormalities and oxidative stress, no biological mechanism is known for the association between gestational diabetes and autism risk.\n\nMaternal obesity during pregnancy may also increase the risk of autism, although further study is needed.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that folic acid taken during pregnancy could play a role in reducing cases of autism by modulating gene expression through an epigenetic mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by multiple studies.\n\nPrenatal stress, consisting of exposure to life events or environmental factors that distress an expectant mother, has been hypothesized to contribute to autism, possibly as part of a gene-environment interaction. Autism has been reported to be associated with prenatal stress both with retrospective studies that examined stressors such as job loss and family discord, and with natural experiments involving prenatal exposure to storms; animal studies have reported that prenatal stress can disrupt brain development and produce behaviors resembling symptoms of autism. However, other studies have cast doubts on this association, notably population based studies in England and Sweden finding no link between stressful life events and ASD.\n\nThe fetal testosterone theory hypothesizes that higher levels of testosterone in the amniotic fluid of mothers pushes brain development towards improved ability to see patterns and analyze complex systems while diminishing communication and empathy, emphasizing \"male\" traits over \"female\", or in E-S theory terminology, emphasizing \"systemizing\" over \"empathizing\". One project has published several reports suggesting that high levels of fetal testosterone could produce behaviors relevant to those seen in autism.\n\nBased in part on animal studies, diagnostic ultrasounds administered during pregnancy have been hypothesized to increase the child's risk of autism. This hypothesis is not supported by independently published research, and examination of children whose mothers received an ultrasound has failed to find evidence of harmful effects.\n\nSome research suggests that maternal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism, but it remains unclear whether there is a causal link between the two. There is evidence, for example, that this association may be an artifact of confounding by maternal mental illness.\n\nAutism is associated with some perinatal and obstetric conditions. A 2007 review of risk factors found associated obstetric conditions that included low birth weight and gestation duration, and hypoxia during childbirth. This association does not demonstrate a causal relationship. As a result, an underlying cause could explain both autism and these associated conditions. There is growing evidence that perinatal exposure to air pollution may be a risk factor for autism, although this evidence suffers from methodological limitations, including a small number of studies and failure to control for potential confounding factors.\n\nA wide variety of postnatal contributors to autism have been proposed, including gastrointestinal or immune system abnormalities, allergies, and exposure of children to drugs, vaccines, infection, certain foods, or heavy metals. The evidence for these risk factors is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies.\n\nThis theory hypothesizes that an early developmental failure involving the amygdala cascades on the development of cortical areas that mediate social perception in the visual domain. The fusiform face area of the ventral stream is implicated. The idea is that it is involved in social knowledge and social cognition, and that the deficits in this network are instrumental in causing autism.\n\nThis theory hypothesizes that autoantibodies that target the brain or elements of brain metabolism may cause or exacerbate autism. It is related to the maternal infection theory, except that it postulates that the effect is caused by the individual's own antibodies, possibly due to an environmental trigger after birth. It is also related to several other hypothesized causes; for example, viral infection has been hypothesized to cause autism via an autoimmune mechanism.\n\nInteractions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during embryogenesis, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of ASD. A small percentage of autism cases are associated with infection, usually before birth. Results from immune studies have been contradictory. Some abnormalities have been found in specific subgroups, and some of these have been replicated. It is not known whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathology of autism, for example, by infection or autoimmunity, or whether they are secondary to the disease processes. As autoantibodies are found in diseases other than ASD, and are not always present in ASD, the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis found that children with a family history of autoimmune diseases were at a greater risk of autism compared to children without such a history.\n\nWhen an underlying maternal autoimmune disease is present, antibodies circulating to the fetus could contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders.\n\nIn 1979, Jaak Panksepp proposed a connection between autism and opiates, noting that injections of minute quantities of opiates in young laboratory animals induce symptoms similar to those observed among autistic children. Opiate theory hypothesizes that autism is caused by a digestive disorder present from birth which causes gluten (present in wheat-derived foods) and casein (present in dairy products) to be converted to the opioid peptides gliadorphin (aka gluteomorphin) and casomorphin. \nAccording to the theory, exposure to these opiate compounds in young children interferes with normal neurological development by dulling sensory input. Lacking sufficient sensory input, the developing brain attempts to artificially generate the auditory, vestibular, visual, and tactile input on its own. This attempt at generating input manifests itself as behaviors common to autism, such as grunting or screaming (auditory), spinning or rocking back and forth (vestibular), preoccupation with spinning objects or waving of the fingers in front of the eyes (visual), and hand flapping or self-injury (tactile).\n\nThe theory further states that removing opiate precursors from a child's diet may allow time for these behaviors to cease, and neurological development in very young children to resume normally. The possibility of a relationship between autism and the consumption of gluten and casein was first articulated by Kalle Reichelt in 1991. The scientific evidence is not yet adequate to make treatment recommendations regarding diets, such as the GFCF diet, which exclude these substances.\n\nParents have reported gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances in autistic children, and several studies have investigated possible associations between autism and the gut, but the results so far are inconclusive.\n\nThere is some research evidence that autistic children are more likely to have GI symptoms than typical children. Even so, design flaws in studies of elimination diets mean that the data are inadequate to guide treatment recommendations.\n\nAfter a preliminary 1998 study of three children with ASD treated with secretin infusion reported improved GI function and dramatic improvement in behavior, many parents sought secretin treatment and a black market for the hormone developed quickly. Later studies found secretin clearly ineffective in treating autism.\n\nThe hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency has a role in autism is biologically plausible, but not researched.\n\nLead poisoning has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism, as the lead blood levels of autistic children has been reported to be significantly higher than typical.\nThe atypical eating behaviors of autistic children, along with habitual mouthing and pica, make it hard to determine whether increased lead levels are a cause or a consequence of autism.\n\nThis theory hypothesizes that autistic behaviors depend at least in part on a developmental dysregulation that results in impaired function of the locus coeruleus–noradrenergic (LC-NA) system. The LC-NA system is heavily involved in arousal and attention; for example, it is related to the brain's acquisition and use of environmental cues.\n\nThis theory hypothesizes that autism is associated with mercury poisoning, based on perceived similarity of symptoms and reports of mercury or its biomarkers in some autistic children. This view has gained little traction in the scientific community as the typical symptoms of mercury toxicity are significantly different from symptoms seen in autism. The principal source of human exposure to organic mercury is via fish consumption and for inorganic mercury is dental amalgams. The evidence so far is indirect for the association between autism and mercury exposure after birth, as no direct test has been reported, and there is no evidence of an association between autism and postnatal exposure to any neurotoxicant. A meta-analysis published in 2007 concluded that there was no link between mercury and autism.\n\nThis theory hypothesizes that toxicity and oxidative stress may cause autism in some cases. Evidence includes genetic effects on metabolic pathways, reduced antioxidant capacity, enzyme changes, and enhanced biomarkers for oxidative stress; however, the overall evidence is weaker than it is for involvement oxidative stress with disorders such as schizophrenia. One theory is that stress damages Purkinje cells in the cerebellum after birth, and it is possible that glutathione is involved. Autistic children have lower levels of total glutathione, and higher levels of oxidized glutathione. Based on this theory, antioxidants may be a useful treatment for autism.\n\nBruno Bettelheim believed that autism was linked to early childhood trauma, and his work was highly influential for decades both in the medical and popular spheres.\n\nParents, especially mothers, of individuals with autism were blamed for having caused their child's condition through the withholding of affection. Leo Kanner, who first described autism, suggested that parental coldness might contribute to autism. Although Kanner eventually renounced the theory, Bettelheim put an almost exclusive emphasis on it in both his medical and his popular books. Treatments based on these theories failed to help children with autism, and after Bettelheim's death, it came out that his reported rates of cure (around 85%) were found to be fraudulent.\n\nMany studies have presented evidence for and against association of autism with viral infection after birth. Laboratory rats infected with Borna disease virus show some symptoms similar to those of autism but blood studies of autistic children show no evidence of infection by this virus. Members of the herpes virus family may have a role in autism, but the evidence so far is anecdotal. Viruses have long been suspected as triggers for immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis but showing a direct role for viral causation is difficult in those diseases, and mechanisms whereby viral infections could lead to autism are speculative.\n\nThe social construct theory says that the boundary between normal and abnormal is subjective and arbitrary, so autism does not exist as an objective entity, but only as a social construct. It further argues that autistic individuals themselves have a way of being that is partly socially constructed.\n\nAsperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are particular targets of the theory that social factors determine what it means to be autistic. The theory hypothesizes that individuals with these diagnoses inhabit the identities that have been ascribed to them, and promote their sense of well-being by resisting or appropriating autistic ascriptions.\n\nScientific studies have refuted a causal relationship between vaccinations and autism. Despite this, some parents believe that vaccinations cause autism and therefore delay or avoid immunizing their children, for example under the \"vaccine overload\" hypothesis that giving many vaccines at once may overwhelm a child's immune system and lead to autism, even though this hypothesis has no scientific evidence and is biologically implausible. Because diseases such as measles can cause severe disabilities and death, the risk of death or disability for an unvaccinated child is higher than the risk for a child who has been vaccinated. Despite all this, antivaccine activism continues. A developing tactic appears to be the \"promotion of irrelevant research [as] an active aggregation of several questionable or peripherally related research studies in an attempt to justify the science underlying a questionable claim.\"\n\nThe MMR vaccine as a cause of autism is one of the most extensively debated hypotheses regarding the origins of autism. Andrew Wakefield \"et al.\" reported a study of 12 children who had autism and bowel symptoms, in some cases reportedly with onset after MMR. Although the paper, which was later retracted by the journal, concluded \"We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,\" Wakefield nevertheless suggested during a 1998 press conference that giving children the vaccines in three separate doses would be safer than a single dose.\n\nIn 2004, the interpretation of a causal link between MMR vaccine and autism was formally retracted by ten of Wakefield's twelve co-authors. The retraction followed an investigation by \"The Sunday Times\", which stated that Wakefield \"acted dishonestly and irresponsibly\". The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and the U.K. National Health Service have all concluded that there is no evidence of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nIn February 2010, \"The Lancet\", which published Wakefield's study, fully retracted it after an independent auditor found the study to be flawed. In January 2011, an investigation published in the journal \"BMJ\" described the Wakefield study as the result of deliberate fraud and manipulation of data.\n\nPerhaps the best-known hypothesis involving mercury and autism involves the use of the mercury-based compound thiomersal, a preservative that has been phased out from most childhood vaccinations in developed countries including US and the EU. Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. There is no scientific evidence for a causal connection between thiomersal and autism, but parental concern about the thiomersal controversy has led to decreasing rates of childhood immunizations and increasing likelihood of disease outbreaks. In 1999, due to concern about the dose of mercury infants were being exposed to, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that thiomersal be removed from childhood vaccines, and by 2002 the flu vaccine was the only childhood vaccine containing more than trace amounts of thimerosal. Despite this, autism rates did not decrease after the removal of thimerosal, in the US or other countries that also removed thimerosal from their childhood vaccines.\n\nA causal link between thimerosal and autism has been rejected by international scientific and medical professional bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada, and the European Medicines Agency.\n\n"}

The first, Richard Wright's, \"Native Son\" (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger’s brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, Paul Green, a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed. John Houseman and Orson Welles preferred Wright’s original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger’s character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. Canada Lee created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America’s declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation’s attention. \n\nThe second civil rights drama, \"Strange Fruit\" (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith’s controversial novel. Staged by José Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old Jane White as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by Mel Ferrer. Other Blacks in the cast were Juano Hernandez, Edna Thomas, Alonzo Bosan, Ken Renard, and Dorothy Carter. Robert Earl Jones played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because Eleanor Roosevelt wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, “My Day.” \n\nAfter the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. Abbie Mitchell, Augustus Smith, and Peter Morell played the members of Lee’s family. Margo Jones, from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by Maxine Wood. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt’s help and that of Langston Hughes, the play remained alive for 148 performances.\n\n"}
{"id": "2645480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2645480", "title": "Conquest of the Desert", "text": "Conquest of the Desert\n\nThe Conquest of the Desert () was a military campaign directed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca in the 1870s with the intent to establish Argentine dominance over Patagonia, which was inhabited by indigenous peoples. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia and ended the possibility of Chilean expansion there.\n\nArgentine troops killed more than a thousand enemy combatants and displaced over 15,000 more from their traditional lands. Ethnic European settlers developed the lands for agriculture, turning it into a breadbasket that made Argentina an agricultural superpower in the early 20th century. The conquest was paralleled by a similar campaign in Chile called the Occupation of Araucanía.\n\nThe Conquest is highly controversial. Apologists have described the Conquest as bringing civilisation, while revisionists have labelled it a genocide.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish colonists on the shores of the Río de la Plata and the foundation of the city of Buenos Aires during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the Spanish and the local Indian tribes, mainly the Querandí (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for cattle raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing or driving off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.\nThe frontier dividing the colonial farms and the Indian territories gradually moved outwards from Buenos Aires; at the end of the 18th century, the Salado River was the boundary between the civilizations. Many Indians were forced to abandon their tribes to work on the farms. Some assimilated or intermarried with the white population. The group known as gauchos developed from working on the ranches.\n\nAfter Argentina achieved independence in 1816, the provinces had numerous conflicts as they struggled over how to organize. Once these were settled, the government wanted to quickly occupy the lands claimed by the young republic (in part to prevent Chile from encroaching on it). It also wanted to increase the national agricultural production and offer new lands to prospective immigrants.\n\nIn 1833 Juan Manuel de Rosas in Buenos Aires Province and other military leaders in the Cuyo region coordinated offensives to try to exterminate the resistant indigenous tribes, but only Rosas' expedition achieved some success. By this time Chile had founded Punta Arenas in Magellan Strait in 1845, which threatened the Argentine claims in Patagonia. Later in 1861 Chile began the occupation of the Araucanía, which alarmed Argentine authorities because of its rival's growing influence in the zone. Chile had defeated the Mapuche in their central region. This indigenous tribe had strong language and cultural ties to the nomadic tribes on the east side of the Andes, with whom they share the same language.\n\nIn 1872 the indigenous leader Calfucurá and his 6,000 followers attacked the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo and Nueve de Julio. They killed 300 settlers and drove off 200,000 head of cattle. These events were a catalyst for the government to mount the Conquest of the Desert.\n\nThe Indians drove the stolen cattle from the incursions (\"malones\") to Chile through the Rastrillada de los chilenos and traded them for goods. The historian George V. Rauch notes evidence that Chilean authorities knew about the origin of the cattle and consented to the trading in order to strengthen their influence over Patagonian territories. They expected eventually to occupy those lands in the future.\n\nIn 1875 Adolfo Alsina, Minister of War under President Nicolás Avellaneda, presented the government with a plan which he later described as having the goal \"to populate the desert, and not to destroy the Indians.\"\n\nThe first step was to connect Buenos Aires and the \"Fortines\" (fortresses) with telegraph lines. The government signed a peace treaty with chieftain Juan José Catriel. But he broke it a short time later, as together with chieftain \"Namuncurá\" and 3,500 warriors, he attacked Tres Arroyos, Tandil, Azul, and other towns and farms. The casualties were higher than in 1872: Catriel and Namuncurá's forces killed 400 settlers, captured 300, and drove off 300,000 head of cattle.\n\nAlsina attacked the Indians, forcing them to fall back, and leaving \"fortines\" on his way south to protect the conquered territories. He also constructed the 374 km long trench named zanja de Alsina (\"Alsina's trench\"). It was supposed to be a fortified border to the unconquered territories. Three metres wide and two metres deep, it served as an obstacle to cattle drives by the Indians.\n\nThe Indians continued taking cattle from farms in the Buenos Aires Province and the south of the Mendoza Province, but found it difficult to escape as the animals slowed their march. They had to confront the patrolling units that followed them. As the war went on, some Indians eventually signed peace treaties and settled among the \"Christians\" behind the lines of forts. Some tribes allied with the Argentine government, standing neutral or, less often, fighting for the Argentine army. In return, they were granted periodical shipments of cattle and food. After Alsina died in 1877, Julio Argentino Roca was appointed Minister of War, and decided to change the strategy.\n\nJulio Argentino Roca, in contrast to Alsina, believed that the only solution against the Indian threat was to extinguish, subdue or expel them.\n\nAt the end of 1878 he started the first sweep to \"clean\" the area between the Alsina trench and the Negro river by continuous and systematic attacks on the Indian settlements. On 6 December 1878, elements of the Puán Division under Colonel Teodoro García clashed with a war party at the Lihué Calel heights. In a brief but hard fought battle, 50 Indians were killed, 270 captured, and 33 settlers were freed.\n\nNumerous armed encounters would follow, until by December 1878, over 4,000 Indians had been captured and 400 killed, 150 settlers freed and 15,000 head of cattle recovered.\n\nWith 6,000 soldiers armed with new breech-loading Remington rifles, in 1879 he began the second sweep reaching Choele Choel in two months, after killing 1,313 Indians and capturing over 15,000. From other points, southbound companies made their way down to the Negro River and the Neuquén River, a northern tributary of the Negro River. Together, both rivers marked the natural frontier from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean. This attack led to a large migration of Mapuches into the zone around Curarrehue and Pucón, Chile.\n\nMany settlements were built on the basin of these two rivers, as well as a number on the Colorado River. By sea, some settlements were erected on the southern basin of the Chubut River mainly by Welsh colonists in y Wladfa.\n\nRoca followed Nicolás Avellaneda as president. He thought it was imperative to conquer the territory south of the Negro River as soon as possible, and ordered the 1881 campaign under the control of Colonel Conrado Villegas.\n\nWithin a year Villegas conquered the Neuquén Province (he reached the Limay River). The campaign continued to push the Indian resistance further south, to fight the last battle on October 18, 1884. The last rebel group of over 3,000 members under the command of chieftains Inacayal and Foyel surrendered two months later in present Chubut Province.\n\nTo counteract the Argentine conquest of Patagonia, the Chileans supplied arms, ammunition and horses to their Indian Mapuche allies. On 16 January 1883, a 10-man section of a platoon of the Argentine Army in pursuit of a large Indian war party, ran into an ambush in the Pulmarí Valley set up by Chilean soldiers, and in the engagement that followed Captain Emilio Crouzeilles along with Lieutenant Nicolas Lazcano and several privates were killed. On 17 February 1883, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Díaz, at the head of a 16-man Argentine infantry detachment, was trailing a war party of 100 to 150 Indians. Upon reaching Pulmarí Valley, they were surrounded by the Indians and around 50 Chilean soldiers. Heavily outnumbered, the Argentine soldiers skillfully outfought their attackers, including a bayonet charge mounted by the Chilean detachment. On 21 February 1883, according to Argentine Army Major Manuel Prado, 150-200 Indians armed with Winchesters and Martini–Henry rifles attacked an Argentine Army detachment operating on the Argentine-Chilean border, and in a four-hour engagement killed or wounded 22 Argentine soldiers at a cost of some 100 warriors.\n\nHistorian Jens Andermann has noted that contemporary sources on the campaign indicate that the Conquest was intended by the Argentine government to exterminate the indigenous tribes, and thus attempt genocide. First-hand accounts state that Argentine troops killed prisoners and committed \"mass executions\". The 15,000 Indians taken captive \"became servants or prisoners and were prevented from having children.\"\n\nApologists perceive the campaign as intending to conquer specifically those groups of Indians that refused to submit to Argentine law and frequently carried out brutal attacks on frontier civilian settlements. In these attacks, Indians stole many horses and cattle, killed men defending their livestock and captured women and children to become the slaves and/or forced brides of Indian warriors.\n\n\"The Guardian\" alleged in 2011 that two education officials lost their jobs due to the controversy over the Conquest of the Desert: It alleged that Juan José Cresto was forced to resign as a director of the Argentine National Historical Museum because he \"said the Indians were violent parasites who attacked farms and kidnapped women\" and Beatriz Horn, a history teacher in La Pampa Province, was fired for \"telling a radio station that Roca deserved praise for putting Indians to flight and opening Argentina's frontier to European settlers.\" Argentine news sources, however, report Juan José Cresto lost his job for being abusive and violent towards employees and the firing of Beatriz Horn was primarily due to her praise for the military dictator Leopoldo Galtieri.\n\n\n"}

Decompensation may occur due to fatigue, stress, illness, or old age. When a system is \"compensated\", it is able to function despite stressors or defects. Decompensation describes an inability to compensate for these deficiencies. It is a general term commonly used in medicine to describe a variety of situations.\n\nFor example, \"cardiac decompensation\" may refer to the failure of the heart to maintain adequate blood circulation, after long-standing (previously compensated) vascular disease (see heart failure). Short-term treatment of cardiac decompensation can be achieved through administration of dobutamine, resulting in an increase in heart contractility via an inotropic effect.\n\nKidney failure can also occur following a slow degradation of kidney function due to an underlying untreated illness; the symptoms of the latter can then become much more severe due to the lack of efficient compensation by the kidney.\n\nIn psychology, the term refers to the inability to maintain defense mechanisms in response to stress, resulting in personality disturbance or psychological imbalance. Some who suffer from narcissistic personality disorder or borderline personality disorder may decompensate into persecutory delusions to defend against a troubling reality.\n\n"}

{"id": "47930157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47930157", "title": "Floodgates principle", "text": "Floodgates principle\n\nThe floodgates principle, or the floodgates argument, is a legal principle which is sometimes applied by judges to restrict or limit the right to make claims for damages because of a concern that permitting a claimant to recover in such situations might open the metaphorical \"floodgates\" to large numbers of claims and lawsuits. The principle is most frequently cited in common law jurisdictions, and in English tort law in particular.\n\nMost of the situations in which the courts have employed the floodgates argument have revolved around liability in tort, and in particular in relation to the liability for nervous shock or for pure economic loss. The rationale in which the floodgates principle has been applied may vary. In some cases it is expressed to be a constraint upon when a defendant will owe a duty of care, in others it is expressed to be a limitation upon the remoteness of damage for which a defendant should be held responsible for. In other cases it is simply stated as a principle of public policy.\n\nThe floodgates principle is arguably the antithesis of the legal maxim: \"fiat justitia ruat caelum\" (\"let justice be done though the heavens fall\").\n\nThe core of the principle was enunciated by the then-Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals (later Associate Supreme Court Justice) Benjamin N. Cardozo in \"Ultramares Corp. v. Touche\" (1932) 174 N.E. 441 as the risk of exposing defendants to liability for \"indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class\".\n\nIn \"Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd\" Lord Denning MR put the same point in more expansive terms:\n\nIf a party by their negligence causes physical injury to one other person, then the pool of claimants for that physical injury is just that person. However, if each person who suffers resultant economic loss as a result of the injury to the person is also able to make a claim, then potentially the negligent party (and the courts) could be opened up to a vast array of claims. Similarly, where a party publishes a negligent in a document, if that document is published widely, if every person who read that statement was entitled to rely upon it and claim for any loss caused by relying upon it, there would similarly be an extremely wide-ranging liability for negligent misstatement. The last, and probably most difficult area where the floodates principle has been evoked relates to psychiatric injury, or \"nervous shock\". How far should a person be liable if they injure someone negligently, and then other persons see the accident and suffer psychiatric injury (but no physical harm) just from witnessing the accident? In trying to answer these questions the courts have sometimes fallen back on the floodgates principle to try and limit the potential range of claims.\n\nIn English law the first recorded reference to the floodgates principle was in 1888 in \"Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas\" That case involved a pregnant woman (the claimant) whose husband had driven onto train tracks at a level crossing, and due to the negligence of the gate keeper, were nearly struck by a high speed train. The plaintiff, Mrs Coultas, suffered from serious shock, leading to impaired memory and eyesight, and the loss of her unborn child. Nonetheless, the Privy Council held that she had no sustainable claim for damages, holding that:\n\nThe leading authority on nervous shock cases under English law is now \"Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police\", a case which draws heavily upon the floodates principle. In limiting the right to recover to those who saw the accident or its immediate aftermath Lord Oliver held:\n\nAs an adjunct to the nervous shock cases, the courts have also had to consider claims by persons who are loosely classified as the \"worried well\", i.e. persons who are not actually ill, but have suffered an exposure and therefore are greatly concerned they may become gravely ill. These claims often relate to asbestos exposure, as mesothelioma can take 20 to 50 years, or longer, to manifest after an exposure. To date, the courts have appeared unwilling to consider claims from the \"worried well\".\n\nPure economic loss cases have also felt the strong influence of the concerns of the courts in relation to the floodgates principle. The English Court of Appeal in the decision of \"Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd\" made extensive reference to risks of such claims, and sought to limit economic loss to claims which are proximate to physical damage.\n\nJudicial concern has also been expressed about potential liability for negligent misstatements. Unlike physical acts, a negligent statement may be relied upon by a great many people leading to a wide class of potential claims. Accordingly, in \"Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd\" the House of Lords imposed the requirement that there would need to be a \"special relationship\" in order to justify a duty of care under which a person making a negligent statement could be held liable to a person who relied upon it.\n\nIn \"Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire\" the House of Lords had to consider a claim by Jacqueline Hill, the last victim of Peter Sutcliffe (a serial killer known as the \"Yorkshire Ripper\"), against the police. The case argued that police had been sloppy and careless in their investigation, and if they had not been so the killer would have caught long before he murdered his last few victims. The claim was struck out on a number of grounds, one of which was the risk that every victim of crime might have an action against the police arguing that they should have caught the perpetrators at an earlier stage of their criminal careers.\n\nThe decision was upheld in \"Kent v Griffiths\" and rationalised on a different basis, viz., that the emergency services to do not owe general duties to the public on grounds of public policy.\nHowever, by contrast in \"Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office\" the House of Lords were fully prepared to hold the Home Office responsible for the acts of young offenders whom it failed to supervise, and who subsequently caused damage to the property of various members of the general public.\n\nThe floodgates principle is by no means a principle of universal application.\n\nThe courts have, on occasion, been prepared to uphold claims notwithstanding that they recognise that the effect of a decision will most likely result in a large amount of subsequent litigation. In the case of \"Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC\" the House of Lords upheld a claim that interest rate swaps entered into with local authorities in the United Kingdom were void although they knew that large numbers of such contracts had been entered into, and that unwinding the swaps would result in a large amount of litigation. In the event, over 200 separate sets of legal proceedings were launched, several of which were litigated to the Court of Appeal and three of which reached the House of Lords.\n\n"}

{"id": "47751830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47751830", "title": "Green Dot Bystander Intervention", "text": "Green Dot Bystander Intervention\n\nGreen Dot Bystander Intervention is a bystander education approach that aims to prevent violence with the help of bystanders. It is built on the premise that violence can be measurably and systematically reduced within a community. Bystander intervention as a way of violence prevention programs are becoming popular within society. Its mission is to reduce power based-violence by being a proactive bystander and a reactive bystander.\n\nThe Green Dot Bystander Intervention Program was founded by Dr. Dorothy Edwards. The program trains people about sexual assault and domestic violence on college campuses, primary and secondary schools, and communities. It develops and offers training for sexual assault and domestic violence. The method teaches students to intervene by using the 3 D's: Direct, Delegating the responsibility to others, and creating a Distraction to defuse a potentially dangerous situation. As described by Green Dot an example of this is in a situation at a party, intervening could mean that instead of calling out an inebriated student, an individual can create a distraction by \"accidentally\" spilling their drink on a potential aggressor.\n\nDr. Dorothy Edwards is the founder of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program. Prior to creating the program Dorothy Edwards worked as the University of Kentucky's Violence Intervention and Prevention Director where she discovered that individuals were not sure how to respond when witnessing a potential sexual assault. In her first year of running the program she trained 10 individuals, but by the time she left the University of Kentucky she was training 3,500 students and volunteers. The initiative led by Dr. Edwards was supported by a new focus on bystanders in The White House. Green Dot, Bringing in the Bystander, and Coaching Boys Into Men are preventative bystander programs that have begun to make cultural changes.\n\nTitle IX of the 1972 Education Amendment is a tool meant to combat campus violence. The law requires colleges and universities to fight gender-based violence, harassment, and respond to the needs of survivors promoting equal educational access.\n\nSexual violence in schools and on campuses is a pressing civil rights issue. According to the National Women's Law Center students who suffer from sexual assault and harassment are deprived the liberty of equal education. A majority of sexual assaults involving college students also involve drugs and alcohol. A female or male who is incapacitated due to drugs and alcohol is legally incapable of giving consent and someone who has sex with an incapacitated person can be prosecuted for rape.\n\nThe goal of Green Dot is to implement a bystander intervention strategy that prevents and reduces power-based personal violence. Power-based violence includes: sexual violence, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, child abuse, elder abuse, and bullying. The curriculum is created from the concepts and lessons learned through research and theory across disciplines including: violence against women, diffusion of innovation, public health, social networking, psychology, bystander dynamics, perpetration, and marketing/advertising.\n\nA Green Dot is a behavior, choice, or action that promotes safety for everyone. It communicates intolerance for sexual violence, dating violence, and stalking. The goal is to promote safety on college campuses.\n\nGreen Dot develops programs, strategies, curriculum, and training courses designed to address power-based personal violence across environments. Training strategies include: strategic planning, bystander mobilization, communication, and coalition building. The program provides training courses for leadership and professionals that focus on the core areas necessary for successful implementation of the program.\n\nThe Green Dot bystander program uses four training modules to educate bystanders on their impact. \n\nThe heart of the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program are the 3 D's: direct, distract, and delegate. Direct interaction with the potential perpetrator or victim can be used to address concern. Through Distraction a bystander can create a diversion to diffuse the potentially problematic situation. Lastly, through delegation a bystander can ask for someone else to help intervene in the situation. The 3 D's work in situations of high risk to act as reactive Green Dots.\n\nExamples of proactive Green Dots are creating social media campaigns, checking-in with friends, promoting awareness, and hosting green dot sports games.\n\nExamples of reactive Green Dots include: \"directly\" confronting a situation, \"distracting\" by changing the conversation and the energy of the interaction or by distracting the individuals, or \"delegating\" by finding someone who will be more successful in fixing the problem (bar tender, other friends, police offer, etc.)\n\nAnn Coker at the University of Kentucky's Center for Research on Violence Against Women (CRVAW) led a study pertaining to the effectiveness at Green Dots' reduction of sexual violence. In the study, CRVAW found a greater than 50% reduction in the self-reported frequency of sexual violence perpetration by students at schools that received Green Dot training. The CRVAW study also found a 40% reduction in self-reported frequency of total violence perpetration including sexual violence, sexual harassment, stalking, and dating violence. Ann Coker, and the CRVAW team identify violence prevention as a public health priority.\n\nA recent study of 2,504 college undergraduate students between 18 and 24 looked at the impact of bystander intervention on college campuses. The study found that 46% of the students surveyed had heard a Green Dot speech on their college campus. Out of the sample size surveyed, only 14% had received active bystander training in the past two years. Students trained in Green Dot bystander intervention reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors compared to non-trained students. Those receiving bystander intervention training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than non-exposed students.\n"}

The entire collection was stolen by the Nazis in 1940 and only small portions were recovered after the war. In 1988, the part of the archival collection which had not been looted by the Nazis became the foundational collection of the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement. A substantial portion of the archive was discovered in Moscow in 1992 and returned to Amsterdam in 2003. In 2013, the institution which houses the collection was renamed as the Atria Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History\n\nThe International Archives for the Women's Movement was founded in 1935 by three Dutch feminists, Rosa Manus, Johanna Naber and Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot. Manus was a conference organizer for the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), a secretary of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and was involved with many of the leading feminists of her day, including Aletta Jacobs and Carrie Chapman Catt. When Jacobs died in 1929, her books and papers were bequeathed to Manus. Naber was one of the founders of the IWSA and a historian dedicated to writing about the history of the women's movement, including writing biographies of prominent women. As a member of the National Dutch Women's Council , Naber had begun to collect publications on feminism and create an archive for the NVN and by 1921, had urged creation of a resource for other women to study. Posthumus-van der Goot was an economist and after she attended a 1934 conference arranged by the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship (DAWIEC) to study government policies on paid employment for women, she realized that there was inadequate information on the history of women working.\n\nThe three women's different skill-sets and ages, which constituted three-generations of the Dutch women's movement, combined to persuade the founders of the newly established International Institute of Social History (IISH) (which included Posthumus-van der Goot's husband) to give them two rooms in their building at Keizersgracht 264 for their project. On 3 December 1935, the International Archives for the Women's Movement () was founded with Manus as president and Posthumus-van der Goot as the secretary. Within a year, the official opening of the IAV was held and by 1937 they had established a multi-lingual Yearbook to confirm the international nature of collecting and studying documents about women. The international advisory board, included such members as Margery Corbett Ashby, British feminist and IWSA president from 1926-1946; Cécile Brunschvicg, French feminist, International Council of Women (ICW) member and IWSA delegate; Carrie Chapman Catt, American founder of the IWSA; Dorothy Heneker, Canadian feminist, lawyer and Secretary of the Women's International Organizations' Peace and Disarmament Committee; Bertha Lutz, Brazilian feminist and IWSA board member; Baroness Marthe Boël, Belgian feminist and president of ICW between 1936 and 1947; and Elsie Zimmern, British feminist and ICW general secretary from 1925.\n\nThe women corresponded with women's groups in English, French and German, encouraging them to forward articles, books, brochures, periodicals and the like for inclusion in the archive. They also had reciprocity agreements with other women's facilities, like the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand in Paris and The Fawcett Library of London. By the end of the 1930s, the archive contained approximately 4500 books and brochures, as well as a collection of around 150 periodicals from twenty countries. Most of these journals were contemporary publications, though there was a complete collection of the \"Tribunes des femmes\" from 1833. Several first edition books were part of the archive, including \"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest\" (1694) by Mary Astell and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft. There were original documents by Jane Austen and a manuscript copy of 's novel, \"Hilda van Suylenburg\" (1897).\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This proved to be a costly miscalculation, as when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the Security Police confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers. The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, head of the National Socialist Women's League did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942. Francisca de Haan a professor of gender studies at Budapest's Central European University, believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to do with the facts that Manus, the president was Jewish, both an international feminist and pacifist, and suspected of Communist leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities; Manus would later be executed at Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1943.\n\nThe confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin, and then later were moved to Sudetenland for security reasons. At the end of the war, the Red Army took the documents from German-occupied Czechoslovakia and in 1945-46, stored them in the KGB's (), meaning special archive, which was housed in Moscow. In 1947, Posthumus-van der Goot, the only one of the founders who survived the war, became president of the IAV and reopened the archive. She immediately began making inquiries as to what had happened to their stolen collection, following the lead that women's groups in Berlin had wanted them. , a German philosopher living in Munich wrote her that it was unlikely that any German women, except possibly Scholtz-Klink had any interest in obtaining the materials. In 1947, Dirk Graswinckel, a member of the committee to recover and repatriate Nazi plunder, returned a few boxes, representing about 1/10th of IAV's pre-war holdings. Then in 1966, a librarian from Hradec Králové, Czechoslovakia found four books stamped by the IAV and returned them. In the 1960s, the organization filed for reparations under the Wiedergutmachung program and assumed its remaining holdings were lost.\n\nThe period of actively acquiring materials ceased effectively in 1939 and through the 1970s no efforts were made to expand the collection beyond what had been retrieved, unless an individual or organization donated materials. Though some minor works were published in the 1950s and 1960s by IAV, and they moved several times, little effort was made to reach those beyond Posthumus-van der Goot's circle. In the 1970s during the Second-wave of feminism institutions and organizations began to flourish again. Women's history groups at several Dutch universities began seeking out records on women and re-discovered IAV. Growing interest in preserving women's records and specifically evaluating the history of ordinary women, led to the decision to begin acquiring documents again in the early 1980s, with the specific focus of obtaining journals, letters and diaries from working class women, instead of just women's movement elites. The Dutch government began to subsidize the collection efforts, causing the archive to exponentially expand.\n\nWanting better access to the materials, the first professional inventory was completed in 1980 and the following year, having outgrown their space, IAV moved to Keizersgracht 10 in Amsterdam, sharing offices with three other women's organizations: the Documentation Centre for the Women's Movement (), the journal \"Lover\", and the Foundation of Women in the Visual Arts (). In 1988, the IAV, IDC and \"Lover\" organizations were merged to form the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement () with the IAV archival collection underpinning the new institution's holdings.\n\nIn 1992, a report which appeared in \"NRC Handelsblad\", a major Dutch newspaper, written by historian Marc Jansen, noted that some of IAV's materials had been located in Russia. He reported that the Russians were willing to return more than thirty collections, including those of the IAV. Almost immediately the state archivists of both countries met in Moscow and signed an agreement to return the twenty-five boxes of IAV's documents found in Russia, but there were delays because the Russian Parliament refused to ratify the agreement. In 1993, Heleen Massee of the photograph division of IIAV was allowed to go to Moscow and take notes on the content of six boxes.\n\nIn the spirit of Perestroika and Glasnost policy reforms, historian Mineke Bosch and a colleague, Myriam Everard, went to Moscow in 1994 to try to discover what records were held in the Osobyi Archive. Bosch discovered a leather bound volume of newspaper clippings, photographs and translations which had been prepared by Hungarian women for a visit by Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, following the 1906 Copenhagen Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. The Hungarians had invited Catt to visit in October, and advised her to bring a German-speaking companion, who was not German to assist her. To commemorate the visit, Rosika Schwimmer had helped them bind the volume marked with the inscription \"1906 October 12–14\". Upon finding the booklet, Bosch brought it to Everard and they approached the director and asked if they could return it to Amsterdam. Though sympathetic, the director denied their request, claiming that all items had to be counted before they could be returned.\n\nBosch and Everard spent four days in Moscow and inventoried 203 dossiers containing 28,051 documents, discovering hundreds of pictures dated to the 1890s. They found a large portion of Manus' documents but also noted that the collection did not represent the entirety of the stolen artifacts, as most of the 150 periodicals and all of the 4,500 books of the pre-war IAV were absent. When the delays caused concern that the IAV archives might not be returned quickly, the International Institute for Social History microfilmed 14 reels of 33,663 individual images, making the documents accessible once again. Though officials continued to press for the return of the documents bureaucracy delayed any action until an announced 2001 visit by Queen Beatrix to Russia. Finally in January 2002, twenty-two boxes of materials were returned to the Netherlands. Nine boxes, including some of the IAV records were retained because they had not been properly processed. In March 2003, the final nine boxes were sent, and rejoined the archival collection in May.\n\nIn December 2015, nine books, including \"Beroepsarbeid der gehuwde vrouw\" (Occupational work of the married woman, 1921) by Betsy Bakker-Nort were returned from the Berlin Central and Regional Library, bearing the stamp of IAV or Rosa Manus.\n\n"}

That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A’s specification also satisfies B’s specification, because B’s specification is weaker.\n\nThe \"is-a\" relationship is to be contrasted with the \"has-a\" (\"has_a\" or \"has a\") relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations \"has-a\" and \"is-a\" is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a computer program) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The \"is-a\" relationship may also be contrasted with the \"instance-of\" relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see \"type-token distinction\" and \"type-token relations.\"\n\nTo summarize the relations, we have\n\n\nSubtyping enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an is-a relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism.\n\nThe following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself).\n\nThe following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is required.\n\nThe following example, type(a) is a \"regular\" type, and type(type(a)) is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (PyType_Type, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as types.ClassType, can also be considered a distinct metatype.\n\nIn Java, is-a relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements clauses.\n\nUsing the Collections classes, ArrayList<E> implements List<E>, and List<E> extends Collection<E>. So ArrayList<String> is a subtype of List<String>, which is a subtype of Collection<String>. The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When we define an interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element. Its declaration might look like:\n\nThe following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List<String>:\n\nLiskov substitution principle explains a property, \"If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,\". Following example shows a violation of LSP.\nObviously, the DrawShape function is badly formatted. It has to know about every derivative classes of Shape class. Also, it should be changed whenever new subclass of Shape are created. In object-oriented design, many view the structure of this as anathema.\n\nHere is a more subtle example of violation of LSP:\nThis works well but when it comes to Square class, which inherits Rectangle class, it violates LSP even though the is-a relationship holds between Rectangle and Square. Because square is rectangular. The following example overrides two functions, Setwidth and SetHeight, to fix the problem. But fixing the code implies that the design is faulty.\n\nThe following example, function g just works for Rectangle class but not for Square, and so the open-closed principle has been violated.\n\n\n"}

His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have actually intended to reflect on the philosophical position that truth is hard to ascertain. The Greek word rendered as \"truth\" in English translations is \"aletheia\", which literally means \"unconcealed\" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality. \n\nThis verse reflects the Christian tradition of the \"guiltlessness of Jesus\" in Pilate's Court. The innocence of Jesus is important in the Gospel of John, given that it emphasizes Jesus as the Lamb of God.\n\nNote that Jesus, although he does not respond to Pilate's question (perhaps because Pilate \"went out again\" before giving him a chance to) knows the answer. During his prayer in Gethsemane, Jesus tells God, \"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.\" (John 17:17)\n\nIn addition to the guiltlessness of Jesus this verse also reflects the rejection of the truth of God: Jesus, the witness to truth was rejected, ignored and condemned.\n\nThis verse has been widely quoted and alluded to in culture and literature, particularly in that of philosophical nature. While Pilate's question -- whether intended philosophically, jestfully, rhetorically, or born of frustration at the lack of a plain answer -- is by no means the only incident of someone questioning the nature of truth, it has been drawn upon many times as a significant occurrence thereof. \n\nFrancis Bacon uses this musing to open his essay \"Of Truth\", saying that Pilate \"would not stay for an answer\". He uses this to introduce his theme of truth as an affirmation of faith.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche wrote of the line and extended praise to Pilate:\n\"Do I still have to add that in the entire New Testament there is only \"one\" solitary figure one is obliged to respect? Pilate, the Roman governor. To take a Jewish affair \"seriously\" - he cannot persuade himself to do that. One Jew more or less - what does it matter ?... The noble scorn of a Roman before whom an impudent misuse of the word 'truth' was carried on has enriched the New Testament with the only expression \"which\" \"possesses\" \"value\" - which is its criticism, its \"annihilation\" even: 'What is truth?...\" (Nietzsche, writing in \"The Antichrist\", §46)\n\nMikhail Bulgakov fictionally expands on the relationship between Pilate and Jesus in his novel \"Master and Margarita\". Specific reference to John 18:38 comes in Chapter 2 of the novel entitled \"Pontius Pilate\", in which he asks the very question \"What is truth?\" to Jesus (\"Jeshua Ha-Notsri\" - \"Jesus of Nazareth\" in Hebrew).\n\nJ. L. Austin, the ordinary-language philosopher, in a symposium on truth, comments:\n'What is truth?' said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Pilate was in advance of his time. For 'truth' itself is an abstract noun, a camel, that is, of a logical construction, which cannot get past the eye even of a grammarian. We approach it cap and categories in hand : we ask ourselves whether Truth is a substance (the Truth, the Body of Knowledge), or a quality (something like the colour red, inhering in truths), or a relation ('correspondence'). But philosophers should take something more nearly their own size to strain at. What needs discussing rather is the use, or certain uses, of the word 'true.' In vino, possibly, 'veritas,' but in a sober symposium\n'verum.'\n\nIn his novella (and play) \"Home Truths\", David Lodge lets the writer Adrian Ludlow quote \"What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer\" when he is interviewed by the journalist Fanny Tarrant, known for her vicious and perhaps not entirely truthful interviews.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "218426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218426", "title": "Just-in-time manufacturing", "text": "Just-in-time manufacturing\n\nJust-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, also known as just-in-time production or the Toyota Production System (TPS), is a methodology aimed primarily at reducing times within production system as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. Its origin and development was in Japan, largely in the 1960s and 1970s and particularly at Toyota.\n\nAlternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. Motorola's choice was short-cycle manufacturing (SCM). IBM's was continuous-flow manufacturing (CFM), and demand-flow manufacturing (DFM), a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado. Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that \"Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the 'Kanban System'\", and pointed out that kanban is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production.\n\nBut the wide use of the term \"JIT manufacturing\" throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term \"lean manufacturing\" became established as \"a more recent name for JIT\". As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, \"Toyota production system (TPS)\" has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing.\n\nThe exact reasons for adoption of JIT in Japan are unclear. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post-World War II rebuilding of industry: 1) Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. 2) Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3) The Japanese islands were (and are) lacking in natural resources with which to build products. 4) Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes. \"They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased.\" Plenart goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology.\n\nNews about JIT/TPS reached western shores in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the \"Ohno system\", after Taiichi Ohno, who was instrumental in its development within Toyota. The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details. Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group (RMG), which had been founded 1979 within the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to seek advances in manufacturing. The principle speaker, Fujio Cho (later, president of Toyota Motor Corp.), in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMG's shifting gears from things like automation to JIT/TPS.\n\nAt least some of audience's stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new JIT regime and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on JIT vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, \"The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time\". Less confrontational was Walt Goddard's, \"Kanban Versus MRP II—Which Is Best for You?\" in 1982. Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating JIT. Among the best known of MRP II's advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning JIT's kanban planning method and the \"japanning of America\". But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that \"JIT is a concept whose time has come\".\n\nJIT/TPS implementations may be found in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. An article in a 1984 issue of \"Inc\". magazine relates how Omark Industries (chain saws, ammunition, log loaders, etc.) emerged as an extensive JIT implementer under its US home-grown name ZIPS (zero inventory production system). At Omark's mother plant in Portland, Oregon, after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were \"turned loose\" and things began to happen. A first step was to \"arbitrarily eliminate a week's lead time [after which] things ran smoother. 'People asked that we try taking another week's worth out.' After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plant's operations 'like an amoeba.'\" The article also notes that Omark's 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omark's smaller plants making drill bits in Mesabi, Minnesota, \"large-size drill inventory was cut by 92%, productivity increased by 30%, scrap and rework ... dropped 20%, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days.\" The \"Inc\". article states that companies using JIT the most extensively include \"the Big Four, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Westinghouse Electric, General Electric, Deere, and Black and Decker\".\n\nBy 1986, a case-study book on JIT in the U.S. was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on JIT at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Computers, a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors.\n\nTwo similarly-inclined books emergent in the U.K. in the same years are more international in scope. One of the books, with both conceptual articles and case studies, includes three sections on JIT practices: in Japan (e.g., at Toyota, Mazda, and Tokagawa Electric); in Europe (jmg Bostrom, Lucas Electric, Cummins Engine, IBM, 3M, Datasolve Ltd., Renault, Massey-Ferguson); and in the USA and Australia (Repco Manufacturing-Australia, Xerox Computer, and two on Hewlett-Packard). The second book, reporting on what was billed as the First International Conference on just-in-time manufacturing, includes case studies in three companies: Repco-Australia, IBM-UK, and 3M-UK. In addition, a day-2 keynote discussed JIT as applied \"across all disciplines, ... from accounting and systems to design and production\".\n\nThree more books which include JIT implementations were published in 1993, 1995, and 1996, which are start-up years of the lean manufacturing/lean management movement that was launched in 1990 with publication of the book, \"The Machine That Changed the World\". That one, along with other books, articles, and case studies on lean, were supplanting JIT terminology in the 1990s and beyond. The same period, saw the rise of books and articles with similar concepts and methodologies but with alternative names, including \"cycle time management\", \"time-based competition\", \"quick-response manufacturing\", flow, and \"pull-based production systems\".\n\nThere is more to JIT than its usual manufacturing-centered explication. Inasmuch as manufacturing ends with order-fulfillment to distributors, retailers, and end users, and also includes remanufacturing, repair, and warranty claims, JIT's concepts and methods have application downstream from manufacturing itself. A 1993 book on \"world-class distribution logistics\" discusses kanban links from factories onward. And a manufacturer-to-retailer model developed in the U.S. in the 1980s, referred to as \"quick response\", has morphed over time to what is called \"fast fashion\".\n\nSepheri provides a list of methodologies of JIT manufacturing that \"are important but not exhaustive\":\n\nObjectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways: first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies; second, general listings and discussion.\n\nA case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits: reduced cycle times 97%, setup times 50%, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90% – achieved via four focused (cellular) factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment.\n\nAnother study from NCR (Dundee Scotland) in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing: In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60% of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77% going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165.\n\nHewlett-Packard, one of western industry's earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s. The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-P's 52 divisions had adopted JIT.\n\nAccording to Williams, it becomes necessary to find suppliers that are close by or can supply materials quickly with limited advance notice. When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers’ minimum order policies may pose a problem, though.\n\nEmployees are at risk of precarious work when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their workforce in response to supply and demand conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work.\n\n\n"}

This increase is due to the positive relationship between consumption and consumers' disposable income in the consumption function. Aggregate demand may also rise due to increases in investment (due to the accelerator effect), while this rise is reduced if imports and tax revenues rise with income. Equilibrium in this diagram occurs where total demand, \"AD\", equals the total amount of national output, \"Y\", (which corresponds to total national income or production). Here, total demand equals total supply. \n\nIn the diagram, the equilibrium level of output and demand is determined where this desired spending curve intersects a line that represents the equality of total income and output (\"AD=Y\"). The intersection gives the equilibrium output, \"Y\"'.\n\nThe movement toward equilibrium is mostly via changes in inventories inducing changes in production and income. If current output exceeds the equilibrium, inventories accumulate, encouraging businesses to cut back on production, moving the economy toward equilibrium. Similarly, if the level of production is below the equilibrium, then inventories run down, encouraging an increase in production and thus a move toward equilibrium. This equilibration process occurs when the equilibrium is stable, i.e., when the \"AD\" line is less steep than the \"AD=Y\" line.\n\nThe equilibrium level of output determines the equilibrium level of employment in the model. (In a dynamic view, these are connected by Okun's law.) There is no reason within the model why the equilibrium level of employment should correspond to full employment. Bringing in other considerations may imply this correspondence, though.\n\nIf any of the components of aggregate demand (\"C + I + G + NX\") rises at each level of income, for example because business becomes more optimistic about future profitability, that shifts the entire \"AD\" line \"upward\". This raises equilibrium income and output. Similarly, if the elements of \"AD\" fall, that shifts the line downward and lowers equilibrium output. (The \"AD=Y\" line does not shift under the definition used here).\n\nThe Keynesian cross produces an equilibrium under several assumptions. First, the \"AD\" (blue) curve is positive. The \"AD\" curve is assumed to be positive because an increase in national output should lead to an increase in disposable income and, thus, an increase in consumption, which makes up a portion of aggregate demand. Second, the \"AD\" curve is assumed to have a positive, vertical intercept. The \"AD\" curve must have a positive, vertical intercept to cross the \"AD=Y\" curve. If the curves do not cross, there is no equilibrium and no equilibrium output can be determined. The \"AD\" curve will have a positive, vertical intercept as long as there is some aggregated demand—from consumer spending, investment, net exports, or government spending—even if there is no national output. The slope of the \"AD\" curve is steeper given a high multiplier value.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10930909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10930909", "title": "Metaxy", "text": "Metaxy\n\nMetaxy () is defined in Plato's \"Symposium\" via the character of the priestess Diotima as the \"in-between\" or \"middle ground\".\n\nDiotima, tutoring Socrates, uses the term to show how oral tradition can be perceived by different people in different ways. In the poem by Socrates she depicts Eros as not an extreme or purity; rather, as a \"daemon\", Eros is in between the divine Gods and mankind. Diotima thus exposes the flaws of oral tradition; it uses strong contrasts to express truth, thus revealing vulnerability to sophistry. This portion of the dialogue points to the idea that reality is perceptible only through one's character (which includes one's desires and prejudices and one's limited understanding of logic). Man moves through the world of Becoming, the ever changing world of sensory perception, into the world of Being—the world of forms, absolutes and transcendence. Man transcends his place in Becoming by Eros, where man reaches the Highest Good, an intuitive and mystical state of consciousness. Neoplatonists like Plotinus later used the concept to express an ontological placement of Man between the Gods and animals. Much like Diotima did in expressing that Eros as a \"daemon\" was in between the Gods and mankind. Love (\"Eros\") is the thing in between or child of Poverty (\"Penia\") and Possession (\"Poros\").\n\nContemporary political philosopher Eric Voegelin used the term to mean the permanent place where man is in-between two poles of existence. Such as the infinite (Apeiron) and the finite (the divine mind or Nous) reality of existence or between the beginning of existence (Apeiron) and the Beyond existence (ἐπέκεινα \"epekeina\"). As a technical usage Voegelin defined Metaxy as the connection of the mind or nous to the material world and the reverse of the material world's connection to the mind as \"consciousness of being\". Under Voegelin it can also be interpreted to mean a form of perception in contrast to consciousness a template of the mind (or nous) in contrast to the dynamic and unordered flow of experiential consciousness. As a form of reflectiveness in-between two poles of experience (finite and the infinite or immanent and transcendent). The whole of existence being expressed as the cosmos. The Metaxy being man's connection to the material world this as the ground of being. Voegelin taught that those who sought political power for its own end were sophists and those who were seeking meaning and truth in life or union with the knowable and true, were philosophers. Each of these positions manifests a different view regarding Plato's becoming and being; again the place in between each of these poles of experience is metaxy.\n\nThe concept is also used by Simone Weil. She believed that compassion must act in the area of metaxy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54954131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54954131", "title": "Movement for a Democratic Military", "text": "Movement for a Democratic Military\n\nThe Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM) was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the Camp Pendleton Marine Base in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times., it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the House Committee on Internal Security (formally HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group's name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall. Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975.\n\nMDM started at the civilian supported \"Green Machine\" antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton. It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called GI's Against Fascism and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton. The San Diego group already had a newspaper called \"Duck Power\" and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called \"Attitude Check\" whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was \"written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em.\" The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14 in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by Donald W. Duncan, Captain Howard Levy, Angela Davis and a number of active duty GIs.\n\nAt this rally, MDM's spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of \"Duck Power\" and \"Attitude Check\". The Preamble stated \"that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights\" and pledged \"support for the self-determination of all peoples.\" It ended, \"We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer.\"\n\nThe 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, \"human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women,\" the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of \"mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training\", doing away with the \"court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems,\" \"wages equal to the federal minimum wage,\" \"the abolition of the class structure of the military,\" an end to \"all racism everywhere,\" the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton,\" an end to \"the glorification of war,\" and the abolition of the draft.\n\nThe pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called \"GI's Against Fascism\" merged with the group at Camp Pendleton. They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, \"Duck Power\" in San Diego and \"Attitude Check\" at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to \"Dare to Struggle\" which they continued to publish until mid-1971. \"Attitude Check's\" last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment. The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the San Diego Free Press which helped them put out their newspapers.\n\nBy early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the Great Lakes naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors. They began publishing \"The Navy Times Are Changing\" which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year \"drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians.\" When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000.\n\nTom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded \"GI's Against Fascism\" in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at Fort Ord near Monterey, CA which published the \"Right-On Post\" from May to August 1970. And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the Alameda Naval Air Station, Treasure Island, San Francisco and other military bases, which published their newspaper \"Up Against the Bulkhead\" regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until to 1975. The \"Up Against the Bulkhead\" paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship. This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.\n\nIn July 1970 another chapter formed at the El Toro Marine air base in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called \"Pay Back\" consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.\n\nIn mid-1970 a group of GI from the Fort Carson army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called \"Counter Attack\". They were supported by the \"Homefront\" GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.\n\nMDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict \"Rules for MDM Members\". These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.\n\nSome critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented \"would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force.\" In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general Leonard F. Chapman Jr. said MDM was \"a serious threat to the defense of this country.\"\n\nThe House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement \"is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement.\" A witness before the committee described MDM's efforts at Fort Ord as follows: \n\nThe general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the establishment, to conduct…certain operations aimed at distributing propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a military training base.\n\nOther observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable. One scholar observed that MDM viewed \"the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam conflict was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups.\" The \"Stanford Daily\" viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: \"These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed.\"\n\nMDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 \"Right-on Post\" newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: \n\nThe goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. military monster.\n\nSeveral of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the \"Green Machine\" coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected. Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol\n\n\"smashed down the door of a San Diego store front…to break up a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians.\" This was preceded by \"several hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested on non-existent charges.\"\n\nMDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities. Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self-determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.\n\n"}

The thesis is best known for its association with Saul Kripke, who published it in 1971, although it was first derived by the logician Ruth Barcan Marcus in 1947, and later, in simplified form, by W.V.O. Quine in 1953\n\nThe derivation in Kripke's 'Identity and Necessity' is in three steps:\n\nThe first premiss is simply postulated: every object is identical to itself. The second is an application of the principle of substitutivity: if a = b, then a has all the properties b has, thus from Fa, infer Fb, where F is 'nec(a = --)'. The third follows by elementary predicate logic.\n\nIn the later \"Naming and Necessity\", Kripke suggested that the principle could be derived directly, assuming what he called rigid designation. A term is a rigid designator when it designates the same object in every possible world in which that object exists. When a name’s referent is fixed by the original act of naming, it becomes a rigid designator. Some examples of rigid designators include proper names (i.e. ‘Richard Nixon’), natural kind terms ( i.e. ‘gold’ or ‘H2O’) and some descriptions.\n\nProper names are typically rigid designators, but definite descriptions are typically not. So we can speak of \"Richard Nixon\" referring to the same person in all possible worlds, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” could refer to many different people. According to Kripke, the proper name “Richard Nixon” can only be used rigidly, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” can be used non-rigidly. Kripke argues, that if names are rigid designators, then identity must be necessary, because the names ‘a’ and ‘b’ will be rigid designators of an object x if a is identical to b, and so in every possible world, ‘a’ and ‘b’ will both refer to this same object x, and no other, and there could be no situation in which a might not have been b, otherwise x would not have been identical with itself.\n\nThis does not mean that we have knowledge of this necessity. Before the discovery that Hesperus (the evening star) and Phosphorus (the morning star) were the same planet, this fact was not known, and could not have been inferred from first principles. Thus there can be a posteriori necessity.\n\nThe principle can also be applied to natural kinds. If water is HO, then water is \"necessarily\" HO. Since the terms 'water' and 'HO' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'HO'. Therefore, water is necessarily HO. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily HO, but \"conditionally\", \"if\" water is HO (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily HO.\n\n"}
{"id": "2685048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2685048", "title": "Peacemaking", "text": "Peacemaking\n\nPeacemaking is practical conflict transformation focused upon establishing equitable power relationships robust enough to forestall future conflict, often including the establishment of means of agreeing on ethical decisions within a community, or among parties, that had previously engaged in inappropriate (i.e. violent) responses to conflict. Peacemaking seeks to achieve full reconciliation among adversaries and new mutual understanding among parties and stakeholders. When applied in criminal justice matters, peacemaking is usually called restorative justice, but sometimes also transformative justice, a term coined by the late Canadian justice theorist and activist Ruth Morris. One popular example of peacemaking is the several types of mediation, usually between two parties and involving a third, a facilitator or mediator.\n\nSome geopolitical entities, such as nation-states and international organizations, attempt to relegate the term peacemaking to large, systemic, often factional conflicts in which no member of the community can avoid involvement, and in which no faction or segment can claim to be completely innocent of the problems, citing as instances post-genocide situations, or extreme situations of oppression such as apartheid. However peacemaking is a universal and age-old approach to conflict at all levels and among any and all parties, and its principles may be generalized and used in many different kinds of conflicts.\nIn contemporary international affairs, especially after the end of the Cold War, the concept of peacemaking has often been associated to the imposition upon warring parties of a peace settlement, usually under the auspices of an international organization.\nPeacemaking in smaller, traditional societies has often involved rituals. For example, Alula Pankhurst has produced films about peacemaking among Ethiopian communities.\n\nThe process of peacemaking is distinct from the rationale of pacifism or the use of non-violent protest or civil disobedience techniques, though they are often practiced by the same people. Indeed, those who master using nonviolent techniques under extreme violent pressure, and those who lead others in such resistance, have usually demonstrated the capacity not to react to violent provocation in kind, and thus may be more highly skilled at working with groups of people that may have suffered through violence and oppression, keeping them coordinated and in good order through the necessary, often difficult phases of rapprochement.\nGiven that, and a track record of not advocating violent responses, it is these leaders who are usually most qualified for peacemaking when future conflict breaks out between the previously warring sides.\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi is widely recognized as an important theorist of peacemaking strategies. He noted in particular that leaders who had been successful at violent strategies were counter-productive in peace time, simply because these strategies now had to be abandoned. But if a movement had adulated and emulated these people, it was unlikely ever to be able to make permanent peace even with those factions it had conquered or dominated, simply because the leaders lacked the skills and had become leaders in part for their suppression of the other side. Accordingly, even if a movement were to benefit from violent action, and even if such action was extremely effective in ending some other oppression, no movement that sought long-term peace could safely hold up these acts or persons as a moral example or advise emulating either. Gandhi's views have influenced modern ethicists in forming a critique of terrorism, in which even those who support the goals must decry the methods and avoid making, for instance, a suicide bomber into a hero.\n\nThe Catholic Church has changed its view on peacemaking over the centuries. Some early Christians refused to join Rome’s Imperial army. A doctrine of a Just War theory originated with St. Augustine of Hippo in the 5th century. Versions of Just War doctrines have claimed that countries and people should keep peace at all cost. The right of a ruler to go to war must meet the criteria of just cause, comparative justice, competent authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality. The Colombian conflict is the present day, prime Catholic example.\n\nThe tradition of Christianity continues to be taken up by those who seek peace. Jesus taught, \"[...] all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\" (Matthew 26:52, NAB) Twenty years after the cessation of the Reichskonkordat\",\" Pope Paul VI proclaimed “No more war, war never again!” (Address to United Nations General Assembly, October 4, 1965 retweeted by Pope Francis Sept.2, 2013) Christians teach that a great (false) peace will soon be made.\n\n\n\n"}

It was launched in 2013 in all districts of Malakand Division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, namely, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Lower Dir, Upper Dir, Chitral and Malakand Agency.\n\nThe Programme for Economic Advancement and Community Empowerment (PEACE) commenced after an agreement worth € 40 million was signed between the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) and the European Union (EU). The project runs under the principles of financial sustainability and equitable sharing of benefits with the community for social development purposes.\n\nUnder the PEACE project 62% of the funding is utilised for generation of community run micro-hydro power units in the project areas. Hydro power stations under the project are primarily built in areas where there is no active national grid or where such grid stands disrupted. Communities contribute time and labour, known as \"sweat equity\", which creates a sense of ownership and helps sustain the projects. The MHPs are run as a social enterprise and its earnings are spent on the welfare of local communities, particularly women. Electricity is generated harnessing the small glacier-meltwater rivers that drop steeply off soaring mountains.\n\nThe European Union under the PEACE project has funded the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) to set up 240 micro hydropower plants, in the Malakand Division. In general, PKR 4/unit is charged for domestic and PKR 7-10/unit is charged for commercial use.\n\nA significant portion of the funds are allocated to the building or restoration of basic infrastructure such as road, bridges, water channels etc.\n\nElectricity from hydro schemes cuts down the use of wood for cooking, heating and lighting, consequently reducing deforestation which is a huge problem in the region. The hydro schemes also cut greenhouse gas emissions, by virtually eliminating the use of kerosene lighting, cutting the use of diesel generators, and also reducing the use of unsustainable wood. A detailed breakdown has not been made of fuels replaced, but an indication of the significance can be made by assuming that the estimated 110,000 MWh of electricity generated each year replaces diesel generation producing around 0.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide per MWh. This suggests a substantial greenhouse gas saving of around 88,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.\n\nPakistan is only producing 128 out of a potential of 3,100 MW of electricity from small hydropower projects.\n\nIn 2015 the Programme for Economic Advancement and Community Empowerment (PEACE) project earned the Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP) an Ashden Award for Increasing Energy Access. In 2017 the project attracted the National Award given out by the Energy Globe Award in Pakistan for supplying electricity to off-grid areas. \n\n"}
{"id": "1796242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796242", "title": "Rationalization (sociology)", "text": "Rationalization (sociology)\n\nIn sociology, rationalization (or rationalisation) is the replacement of traditions, values, and emotions as motivators for behavior in society with concepts based on rationality and reason. For example, the implementation of bureaucracies in government is a kind of rationalization, as is the construction of high-efficiency living spaces in architecture and urban planning. A potential reason as to why rationalization of a culture may take place in the modern era is the process of globalization. Countries are becoming increasingly interlinked, and with the rise of technology, it is easier for countries to influence each other through social networking, the media and politics. An example of rationalization in place would be the case of witch doctors in certain parts of Africa. Whilst many locals view them as an important part of their culture and traditions, development initiatives and aid workers have tried to rationalize the practice in order to educate the local people in modern medicine and practice (Giddens, 2013).\n\nMany sociologists, critical theorists and contemporary philosophers have argued that rationalization, falsely assumed as progress, has had a negative and dehumanizing effect on society, moving modernity away from the central tenets of Enlightenment. The founders of sociology had critical reaction to rationalization:\n\nRationalization formed a central concept in the foundation of classical sociology, particularly with respect to the emphasis the discipline placed – by contrast with anthropology – on the nature of modern Western societies. The term was presented by the profoundly influential German antipositivist Max Weber, though its themes bear parallel with the critiques of modernity set forth by a number of scholars. A rejection of dialectism and sociocultural evolution informs the concept.\n\nWeber demonstrated rationalization in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", in which the aims of certain Protestant Theologies, particularly Calvinism, are shown to have shifted towards rational means of economic gain as a way of dealing with their 'salvation anxiety'. The rational consequences of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with its religious roots, and so the latter were eventually discarded. Weber continues his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy and on the classifications of authority. In these works he alludes to an inevitable move towards rationalization.\n\nWeber believed that a move towards rational-legal authority was inevitable. In charismatic authority, the death of a leader effectively ends the power of that authority, and only through a rationalized and bureaucratic base can this authority be passed on. Traditional authorities in rationalized societies also tend to develop a rational-legal base to better ensure a stable accession. (See also: Tripartite classification of authority)\n\nWhereas in traditional societies such as feudalism governing is managed under the traditional leadership of, for example, a queen or tribal chief, modern societies operate under rational-legal systems. For example, democratic systems attempt to remedy qualitative concerns (such as racial discrimination) with rationalized, quantitative means (for example, civil rights legislation). Weber described the eventual effects of rationalization in his \"Economy and Society\" as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in an \"iron cage\" (or \"steel-hard casing\") of rule-based, rational control.\n\nJürgen Habermas has argued that understanding rationalization properly requires going beyond Weber's notion of rationalization. It requires distinguishing between \"instrumental rationality\", which involves calculation and efficiency (in other words, reducing all relationships to those of means and ends), and \"communicative rationality\", which involves expanding the scope of mutual understanding in communication, the ability to expand this understanding through reflective discourse about communication, and making social and political life subject to this expanded understanding.\n\nFor Zygmunt Bauman, rationalization as a manifestation of modernity may be closely associated with the events of the Holocaust. In \"Modernity and Ambivalence\", Bauman attempted to give an account of the different approaches modern society adopts toward the stranger. He argued that, on the one hand, in a consumer-oriented economy the strange and the unfamiliar is always enticing; in different styles of food, different fashions and in tourism it is possible to experience the allure of what is unfamiliar.\n\nYet this strange-ness also has a more negative side. The stranger, because he cannot be controlled and ordered, is always the object of fear; he is the potential mugger, the person outside of society's borders who is constantly threatening. Bauman's most famous book, \"Modernity and the Holocaust\", is an attempt to give a full account of the dangers of these kinds of fears. Drawing upon Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno's books on totalitarianism and the Enlightenment, Bauman argues that the Holocaust should not simply be considered to be an event in Jewish history, nor a regression to pre-modern barbarism. Rather, he says, the Holocaust should be seen as deeply connected to modernity and its order-making efforts. Procedural rationality, the division of labour into smaller and smaller tasks, the taxonomic categorization of different species, and the tendency to view rule-following as morally good all played their role in the Holocaust coming to pass.\n\nFor this reason, Bauman argues that modern societies have not fully taken on board the lessons of the Holocaust; it is generally viewed – to use Bauman's metaphor – like a picture hanging on a wall, offering few lessons. In Bauman's analysis, the Jews became 'strangers' \"par excellence\" in Europe; the Final Solution was pictured by him as an extreme example of the attempts made by societies to excise the uncomfortable and indeterminate elements existing within them. Bauman, like the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, contended that the same processes of exclusion that were at work in the Holocaust could, and to an extent do, still come into play today.\n\nIn their analysis of contemporary western society, \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1944, revised 1947), Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer developed a wide and pessimistic concept of enlightenment. In their analysis, enlightenment had its dark side: while trying to abolish superstition and myths by 'foundationalist' philosophy, it ignored its own 'mythical' basis. Its strivings towards totality and certainty led to an increasing instrumentalization of reason. In their view, the enlightenment itself should be enlightened and not posed as a 'myth-free' view of the world. For Marxist philosophy in general, rationalization is closely associated with the concept of \"commodity fetishism\", for the reason that not only are products designed to fulfill certain tasks, but employees are hired to fulfill specific tasks as well.\n\nModern food consumption typifies the process of rationalization. Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. Fast-food restaurants, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency has been accomplished in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals and the addition of drive-through windows.\n\nRationalization is also observable in the replacement of more traditional stores, which may offer subjective advantages to consumers, such as what sociologists consider a less regulated, more natural environment, with modern stores offering the objective advantage of lower prices to consumers. The case of Wal-Mart is one strong example demonstrating this transition. While Wal-Marts have attracted considerable criticism for effectively displacing more traditional stores, these subjective social-value concerns have held minimal effectiveness in limiting expansion of the enterprise, particularly in more rationalized nations, due to the preferences of the public for lower prices over the advantages sociologists claim for more traditional stores.\n\nThe sociologist George Ritzer has used the term McDonaldization to refer, not just to the actions of the fast food restaurant, but to the general process of rationalization. Ritzer distinguishes four primary components of McDonaldization:\n\n\nAs capitalism itself is a rationalized economic policy, so is the process of commercialization it utilizes in order to increase sales. Most holidays, for instance, were created out of a religious context or in celebration of some past event. However, in rationalized societies these traditional values are increasingly diminished and the aim shifts from the qualitative aim of a meaningful celebration to the more quantitative aim of increasing sales.\n\nIn the United States, for example, most major holidays now are represented by rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem. In more traditional environments, gifts are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present they are interested in receiving. In these societies, the value of a gift is more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).\n\nOne rational tendency is towards increasing the efficiency and output of the human body. Several means can be employed in reaching this end, including trends towards regular exercise, dieting, increased hygiene, drugs, and an emphasis on optimal nutrition. As well as increasing lifespans, these allow for stronger, leaner, more optimized bodies for quickly performing tasks. Another aspect of this is maintaining a certain level of physical attraction. Processes such as the combing of hair, use of a fragrance, having an appropriate haircut, and wearing certain clothes receive calculated use, that of giving off a certain impression to other individuals. In these cases, we see how rationalization does produce meaning and is not just simply a way to speed things up, i.e., a fat person is said to have poor self-control and discipline and thus you can now make personal judgments about them.\n\nAnother trend is in the bureaucratization of processes that formerly might have been done through the home. This includes the use of hospitals for childbirth and the use of doctors to identify symptoms of an illness and to prescribe treatment.\n\nRationalized education tends to focus less on subjects based around the use of critical discourse (for instance, religion) and more on matters of a calculated importance (such as business administration). This is reflected also in the move towards standardized and multiple choice testing, which measures students on the basis of numbered answers and against a uniform standard.\n\n\n"}

He was the third Director of the Natural History Museum, and was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society.\n\nRay Lankester was born on 15 May 1847 on Burlington Street in London, the son of Edwin Lankester, a coroner and doctor-naturalist who helped eradicate cholera in London, and his wife, the botanist and author Phebe Lankester. Ray Lankester was probably named after the naturalist John Ray: his father had just edited the memorials of John Ray for the Ray Society.\n\nIn 1855 Ray went to boarding school at Leatherhead, and in 1858 to St Paul's School. His university education was at Downing College, Cambridge, and Christ Church, Oxford; he transferred from Downing, after five terms, at his parents' behest because Christ Church had better teaching in the form of the newly appointed George Rolleston.\n\nLankester achieved first-class honours in 1868. His education was rounded off by study visits to Vienna, Leipzig and Jena, and he did some work at the Stazione Zoologica at Naples. He took the examination to become a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and studied under Thomas H. Huxley before taking his MA.\n\nLankester therefore had a far better education than most English biologists of the previous generation, such as Huxley, Wallace and Bates. Even so, it could be argued that the influence of his father Edwin and his friends were just as important. Huxley was a close friend of the family, and whilst still a child Ray met Hooker, Henfrey, Clifford, Gosse, Owen, Forbes, Carpenter, Lyell, Murchison, Henslow and Darwin.\n\nHe was a large man with a large presence, of warm human sympathies and in his childhood a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln. His interventions, responses and advocacies were often colourful and forceful, as befitted an admirer of Huxley, for whom he worked as a demonstrator when a young man. In his personal manner he was not so adept as Huxley, and he made enemies by his rudeness. This undoubtedly damaged and limited the second half of his career.\n\nLankester appears, thinly disguised, in several novels. He is the model for Sir Roderick Dover in H.G. Wells' \"Marriage\" (Wells had been one of his students), and in Robert Briffault's \"Europa\", which contains a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with Karl Marx. (Lankester was one of the eight people at Marx's funeral.) He has also been suggested as the model for Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\", but Doyle himself said that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named William Rutherford.\n\nLankester never married. In 1895, he was arrested and acquitted over sexual offences with young men. He died in London on 15 August 1929.\n\nA finely decorated memorial plaque to him can be seen at the Golders Green Crematorium, Hoop Lane, London.\n\nLankester became a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1873. He co-edited the \"Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science\" which his father had founded. From 1869 until his death he edited this journal (jointly with his father, 1869–71). He worked as one of Huxley's team at the new buildings in South Kensington, and after the death of Francis Balfour became Huxley's intended successor.\n\nLankester was appointed Jodrell Professor of Zoology and curator of what is now the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London from 1874 to 1890, Linacre Professor of Comparative Anatomy at Merton College, Oxford, from 1891 to 1898, and director of the Natural History Museum from 1898 to 1907. He was a founder in 1884 of the Marine Biological Association and served as its second President between 1890 and 1929. Influential as teacher and writer on biological theories, comparative anatomy, and evolution, Lankester studied the protozoa, mollusca, and arthropoda. He was knighted in 1907, awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1913, and the Linnean Society of London's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1908.\n\nAt University College London (the 'Godless Institute of Gower Street') Lankester taught W.F.R. Weldon (1860–1906), who went on to succeed him in the chair at UCL. Another interesting student was Alfred Gibbs Bourne, who went on to hold senior positions in biology and education in the Indian Empire. When Lankester left to take up the Linacre chair at Oxford in 1891, the Grant Museum at UCL continued to grow under Weldon who added a number of extremely rare specimens. Weldon is perhaps best known for founding the science of biometry with Francis Galton (1822–1911) and Karl Pearson (1857–1936). He followed Lankester to Oxford in 1899.\nAfter Huxley the most important influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected Lamarckism, and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution at a time when other biologists had doubts. Weismann's separation of germplasm (genetic material) from soma (somatic cells) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester was one of the first to see its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English.\n\nLankester was hugely influential, though perhaps more as a teacher than as a researcher. Ernst Mayr said \"It was Lankester who founded a school of selectionism at Oxford\". Those he influenced (in addition to Weldon) included Edwin Stephen Goodrich (Linacre chair in zoology at Oxford 1921–46) and (indirectly) Julian Huxley (the evolutionary synthesis). In turn their disciples, such as E.B. Ford (ecological genetics), Gavin de Beer (embryology and evolution), Charles Elton (ecology) and Alister Hardy (marine biology) held sway during the middle years of the 20th century.\n\nAs a zoologist Lankester was a comparative anatomist of the Huxley school, working mostly on invertebrates. He was the first to show the relationship of the horseshoe crab or \"Limulus\" to the Arachnida. His \"Limulus\" specimens can still be seen in the Grant Museum of Zoology at UCL today. He was also a voluminous writer on biology for the general readership; in this he followed the example of his old mentor, Huxley.\n\nLankester's books \"Developmental history of the Mollusca\" (1875) and \"Degeneration: a chapter in Darwinism\" (1880) established him as a leader in the study of invertebrate life histories. In \"Degeneration\" he adapted some ideas of Ernst Haeckel and Anton Dohrn (the founder and first director of the Stazione Zoologica, Naples). Connecting Dohrn's work with Darwinism, Lankester held that degeneration was one of three general avenues that evolution might take (the others being balance and elaboration). Degeneration was a suppression of form, \"Any new set of conditions which render [a species'] food and safety very easily obtained, seem to lead to degeneration\". Degeneration was well known in parasites, and Lankester gave several examples. In \"Sacculina\", a genus of barnacles which is a parasite of crabs, the female is little more than \"a sac of eggs, and absorbed nourishment from the juices of its host by root-like processes\" (+ wood-engraved illustration). He called this degenerative evolutionary process in parasites \"retrogressive metamorphosis\".\n\nLankester pointed out that retrograde metamorphosis could be seen in many species that were not, strictly speaking, degenerate. \"Were it not for the recapitulative phases of the barnacle, we may doubt whether naturalists would \"ever\" have guessed it was a crustacean.\" The lizard \"Seps\" has limbs which are \"ridiculously small\", and \"Bipes\", a burrowing lizard, has no front limbs, and rear limbs reduced to stumps. The Dibamidae are legless lizards of tropical forests who also adopt the burrowing habit. Snakes, which have evolved unique forms of locomotion, and are probably derived from lizards. Thus degeneration or retrogressive metamorphosis sometimes occurs as species adapt to changes in habit or way of life.\n\nAs evidence of degeneration, Lankester identifies the recapitulative development of the individual. This is the idea propagated by Ernst Haeckel as a source of evolutionary evidence (recapitulation theory). As antecedents of degeneration, Lankester lists:\nHe also considered the axolotl, a mole salamander, which can breed whilst still in its gilled larval form without maturing into a terrestrial adult. Lankester noted that this process could take the subsequent evolution of the race into a totally different and otherwise improbable direction. This idea, which Lankester called \"super-larvation\", is now called neoteny.\n\nLankester extended the idea of degeneration to human societies, which carries little significance today, but it is a good example of a biological concept invading social science. Lankester and H.G. Wells used the idea as a basis for propaganda in favour of social and educational reform.\n\nIn Lankester's time the Natural History Museum had its own building in South Kensington, but in financial and administrative matters it was subordinate to the British Museum. Moreover, the Superintendent (= Director) of the NHM was the subordinate of the Principal Librarian of the BM, a fact which was bound to cause trouble since that august person was not a scientist. We can see that the conflict which took place was one aspect of the struggle undertaken, in their different ways, by Owen, Hooker, Huxley and Tyndall to emancipate science from enslavement by traditional forces.\n\nThere was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, who was on the point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the palaeographer, was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended to take control of the whole Museum, including the Natural History departments. In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, Mitchell, Poulton, and Weldon were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).\n\nLankester was appointed in 1898, and the outcome was inevitable. Eight years of conflict with Maunde Thompson followed, with Thompson constantly interfering in the affairs of the museum and obstructing Lankester's attempt to improve the museum. Lankester resigned in 1907, at the direction of Thompson, who had discovered a clause in the regulations which allowed him to call for the resignation of officials at the age of 60. Lazarus Fletcher was appointed in his stead. There was a vast clamour in the press, and from foreign zoologists protesting at the treatment of Lankester. That Lankester had some friends in high places was shown by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering him an enhanced pension, and the knighthood that was bestowed on him the next year.\n\nThe issues raised by this affair did not end there. Eventually the NHM gained, first, its administrative freedom, then finally there was a complete separation from the BM. Today the British Library, the British Museum and the Natural History Museum all occupy separate buildings, and have complete legal, administrative and financial independence from each other.\n\nLankester had close family connections with Suffolk (the Woodbridge and Felixstowe area), and was an active member of the Rationalist group associated with the circle of Thomas Huxley, Samuel Laing and others. He was a friend of the Rationalist Edward Clodd of Aldeburgh. From 1901 to his death in 1929 he was Honorary President of the Ipswich Museum. He became convinced of the human workmanship of the (now unfavoured) 'Pre-palaeolithic' implements and rostro-carinates, and championed their cause at the Royal Society in 1910–1912. Through correspondence he became the scientific mentor of the Suffolk prehistorian James Reid Moir (1879–1944). He was a friend of Karl Marx in the latter's later years and was among the few persons present at his funeral.\n\nLankester was active in attempting to expose the frauds of Spiritualist mediums during the 1920s. He was an important writer of popular science, his weekly newspaper columns over many years being assembled and reprinted in a series of books entitled \"Science from an Easy Chair\" (first series, 1910; second series, 1912).\n\nHis professional writings include the following:\n\n\nThe \"Lankester Pamphlets\" are held at the National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. These consist of 43 volumes of reprints, with an author index.\n\nIn 1903 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on \"Extinct Animals\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42446", "title": "Reason", "text": "Reason\n\nReason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans.\nReason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as rationality.\n\nReasoning is associated with thinking, cognition, and intellect. The philosophical field of logic studies ways in which humans reason formally through argument. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning (forms associated with the strict sense): deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal, such as intuitive reasoning and verbal reasoning. Along these lines, a distinction is often drawn between logical, discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\n\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination. \n\nIn contrast to the use of \"reason\" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals. \n\nUsing reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, \"morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.\" \n\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.\n\nIn the English language and other modern European languages, \"reason\", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.\n\nThe earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words \"\"logos\", \"ratio\", \"raison\"\" and \"reason\" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word \"reason\" in senses such as \"human reason\" also overlaps to a large extent with \"rationality\" and the adjective of \"reason\" in philosophical contexts is normally \"rational\", rather than \"reasoned\" or \"reasonable\". Some philosophers, Thomas Hobbes for example, also used the word \"ratiocination\" as a synonym for \"reasoning\".\n\nThe proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science, starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive, or \"self-correcting\", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy. It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.\n\nFor many classical philosophers, nature was understood teleologically, meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (\"psyche\"), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (\"thumos\") and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He \"defined\" the highest human happiness or well being (\"eudaimonia\") as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.\n\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via Averroes, came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance, and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.\n\nThe early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in Europe. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world. Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same \"laws of nature\" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.\n\nAccordingly, in the 17th century, René Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as \"rational animals\", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than \"thinking things\" along the lines of other \"things\" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.\n\nIn his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt \"all\" knowledge – \"except\" that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:\n\nAt this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.\n\nThis eventually became known as epistemological or \"subject-centred\" reason, because it is based on the \"knowing subject\", who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.\n\nA contemporary of Descartes, Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of \"addition and subtraction\" which is not limited to numbers. This understanding of reason is sometimes termed \"calculative\" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that \"No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come\" but that \"sense and memory\" is absolute knowledge.\n\nIn the late 17th century, through the 18th century, John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.\n\nHume famously remarked that, \"We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas, and that \"reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations.\" It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.\n\nIn the 18th century, Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a \"transcendental\" self, or \"I\", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge (epistemology), and understanding.\n\nIn the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason () is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on \"universal\" laws.\n\nHere practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms, and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature.\n\nUnder practical reason, the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on religious understanding and interpretation, or nature for their substance.\n\nAccording to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the \"categorical imperative\", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:\n\nAct only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nIn contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German \"Vernunft\") has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his \"transcendental logic\" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.\n\nAccording to Jürgen Habermas, the \"substantive unity\" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question \"How should I live?\" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or \"procedural.\" He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):\n\n\nFor Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the \"lifeworld\" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.\n\nHamann, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty, and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity, or \"spirit\" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.\n\nSome thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other \"forms\" of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.\n\nIn the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to \"re-orient\" this critique of reason, or to recognize the \"other voices\" or \"new departments\" of reason:\n\nFor example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity.\n\nNikolas Kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as \"that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness\" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.\n\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor, influenced by the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger, has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure, which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new \"department\" of reason.\n\nIn the essay \"What is Enlightenment?\", Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between \"private\" and \"public\" uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:\n\n\nThe terms \"logic\" or \"logical\" are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term \"reason\" or with the concept of being \"rational\", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern economics, rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice.\n\nReason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.\n\nReason is a type of thought, and the word \"logic\" involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, especially \"Prior Analysis\" and \"Posterior Analysis\". Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's newly coined word \"syllogism\" (\"syllogismos\") identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to \"the logical\" (\"hē logikē\"), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.\n\nAs pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of \"associative thinking\", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.\n\nHuman reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.\n\nMore generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols, as well as indices and icons, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire. One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language.\n\nThe connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. Thomas Hobbes described the creation of \"Markes, or Notes of remembrance\" (\"Leviathan\" Ch.4) as \"speech\". He used the word \"speech\" as an English version of the Greek word \"logos\" so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called \"Signes\" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (\"logos\"), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and \"nous\", and even uses the word \"logos\" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.\n\nReason and imagination rely on similar mental processes. Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that \"phantasia\" (imagination: that which can hold images or \"phantasmata\") and \"phronein\" (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or \"logos\". But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.\n\nThe recent modern writings of Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald, writing about the origin of language, also connect reason connected to not only language, but also mimesis, More specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness, and imagination or fantasy. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker, to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.\n\nAs reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of \"icons\" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes\nA dog might perceive the \"meaning\" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself\n\nIn classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is \"eikasia\", in the philosophy of Plato. This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as \"dianoetic eikasia\" is the \"eikasia\" concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, \"signes\", and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible \"objects of thought\" as \"foundations\" (\"hypothēses\" in Ancient Greek). This thinking (\"dianoia\") is \"...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' \"noēta\".\"\n\nBoth Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of \"mimesis\", often translated as \"imitation\" or \"representation\". Donald writes\nImitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.\n\n\"Mimēsis\" is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the \"Poetics\". In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.\nIt is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...\n\nDonald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in \"On Memory and Recollection\"), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek \"anamnēsis\", normally translated as \"recollection\" was opposed to \"mneme\" or \"memory\". Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also \"that\" something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of \"eikasia\" \"...but nothing except man is able to recollect.\" Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, \"To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.\" Donald calls the same thing \"autocueing\", which he explains as follows: \"Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational \"thinking\".\"\n\nIn a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay \"On Fairy Stories\" that the terms \"fantasy\" and \"enchantment\" are connected to not only \"...the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires...\" but also \"...the origin of language and of the mind.\"\n\nLooking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as \"the science of deduction\". The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.\n\nA subdivision of Philosophy is Logic. Logic is the study of reasoning. Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process. One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following:\n\n\nThe reasoning in this argument is valid, because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.\n\nInduction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences, or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns.\n\nInductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.\n\nA classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume:\n\nAbductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of inductive reasoning, since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is reasoning from the particular to the particular. It is often used in case-based reasoning, especially legal reasoning. An example follows:\n\n\nAnalogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example, but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general. Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:\n\n\nFlawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.\n\nFormal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word \"formal\" refers to this link to the \"form\" of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.\n\nAn informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the \"content\", rather than mere \"structure\", of the argument.\n\nPhilosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).\n\nSince classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction, to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.\n\nThis leads to the question of what types of first principles, or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, \"first principles\" are \"archai\", \"starting points\", and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as \"nous\" which was close in meaning to \"awareness\" or \"consciousness\".\n\nEmpiricism (sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable. Idealism, (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a \"higher\" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.\n\nPhilosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas and Hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel, \"...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.\"\n\nSince the 17th century rationalists, reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty, or rather the unaided ability (pure reason) to form concepts. For Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, this was associated with mathematics. Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts (time and space) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.\n\nAfter Plato and Aristotle, western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites. Stoic philosophy by contrast considered all passions undesirable. After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions. Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim \"follow your heart\".\n\nReason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably in the work of David Hume, and more recently of Freud. Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called \"rationalization\".\n\nRousseau first proposed, in his second \"Discourse\", that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, \"best suits his constitution\"? Rousseau saw \"two principles prior to reason\" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, \"Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the \"Contrat Social\" and the moral education in \"\". All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.\"\n\nThis quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kant's new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways, German Idealism after Kant, and major later figures such Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or \"urges\" of \"reason\". The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as Nikos Kazantzakis) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state.\n\nAnother view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled \"Descartes' Error\" by Antonio Damasio. In it, Damasio presents the \"Somatic Marker Hypothesis\" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as \"gut feelings\") are \"intuitive signals\" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.\n\nThere are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.). Though the theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not claim to be irrational, there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of wisdom, law and truth.\n\nReligious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism: \nSome commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between \"unaided\" reason and faith in \"revealed\" truths—figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem, respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a \"Greater West\" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation, including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the great Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature (by which we mean \"physis\" in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the \"discovery or invention of nature\" and the \"pre-philosophical equivalent of nature\" was supplied by \"such notions as 'custom' or 'ways, which appear to be \"really universal in all times and places\". The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding \"archai\" (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.\n\nAlthough there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as Hinduism, because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.\n\nAristotle famously described reason (with language) as a part of human nature, which means that it is best for humans to live \"politically\" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state (\"polis\" in Greek). For example...\nIt is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [\"politikon\" = of the \"polis\"] animal [\"zōion\"] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [\"logos\"]. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [\"logos\"] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [\"polis\"]. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the \"polis\"], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. (Aristotle's Politics 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)\n\nThe concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau's Second Discourse, and secondly, the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the \"polis\" had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.\nFriendship [\"philia\"] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to nature [\"kata phusin\"]; for people are by nature [\"tēi phusei\"] pairing [\"sunduastikon\"] more than political [\"politikon\" = of the \"polis\"], inasmuch as the household [\"oikos\"] is prior [\"proteron\" = earlier] and more necessary than the \"polis\" and making children is more common [\"koinoteron\"] with the animals. In the other animals, community [\"koinōnia\"] goes no further than this, but people live together [\"sumoikousin\"] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [\"erga\"] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [\"eis to koinon\"]. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [\"chrēsimon\"] and pleasure [\"hēdu\"] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. (Nicomachean Ethics, VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)\n\nRousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.\n\nIn other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.\n\nThe two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by Karl Marx, a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.\n\nHowever, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as Geneva, and rural living.\n\nScientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.\n\nAssessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning. Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts.\n\nExperimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., \"If A then B\" and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., \"A or else B\". They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., \"A is to the left of B\", or \"A happens after B\", and about quantified assertions, e.g., \"All the A are B\". Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.\n\nDevelopmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.\n\nThe biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.\n\nIn artificial intelligence and computer science, scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages, and formal specification in software engineering.\n\nMeta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation. This requires a programming language capable of reflection, the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.\n\nA species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs (confirmation bias). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. They suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.\n\n\n"}

According to an essay by the nineteenth century French philosopher Ernest Renan, a state has the right to exist when individuals are willing to sacrifice their own interests for the community it represents. Unlike self-determination, the right to exist is an attribute of states rather than of peoples. It is not a right recognized in international law. The phrase has featured prominently in the Arab–Israeli conflict since the 1950s.\n\nThe right to exist of a \"de facto\" state may be balanced against another state's right to territorial integrity. Proponents of the right to exist trace it back to the \"right of existence\", said to be a fundamental right of states recognized by writers on international law for hundreds of years.\n\nThomas Paine used the phrase \"right to exist\" to refer to forms of government, arguing that representative government has a right to exist, but that hereditary government does not. In 1823, Sir Walter Scott argued for the \"right to exist in the Greek people\". (The Greeks were then revolting against Turkish rule.) According to Renan's \"What is a Nation?\" (1882), \"So long as this moral\nconsciousness [called a nation] gives proof of its strength by the sacrifices which demand the abdication of the individual to\nthe advantage of the community, it is legitimate and has the right to exist. If doubts arise regarding its\nfrontiers, consult the populations in the areas under dispute.\" Existence is not a historical right, but \"a daily plebiscite, just as an individual's existence is a perpetual affirmation of life,\" Renan said. The phrase gained enormous usage in reference to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. \"If Turkey has a right to exist – and the Powers are very prompt to assert that she has – she possesses an equally good right to defend herself against all attempts to imperil her political existence,\" wrote Eliakim and Robert Littell in 1903. In many cases, a nation's right to exist is not questioned, and is therefore not asserted.\n\nThe right to exist of Armenia became known as the Armenian Question during the Congress of Berlin in 1878, and would again be asked during the Armenian Genocide in World War I.\n\nAccording to Basque nationalists, \"Euzkadi (the name of our country in our own language) is the country of the Basques with as such right to exist independently as a nation as Poland or Ireland. The Basques are a very ancient people...\"\n\nThe phrase, \"right to exist\" has also been used in reference to the right of Chechens (in the eyes of supporters) to establish a state independent from Russia.\n\nIn 1947, a United Nations General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an \"Arab State\" and a \"Jewish State\" to exist within Palestine in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. This has been described by Prof. Joseph Massad as \"a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require.\" The Jewish Agency, precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral declaration of independence, support from neighboring Arab states escalated the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The legal and territorial status of Israel and Palestine is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.\n\nAccording to Ilan Pappé, Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist was part of Folke Bernadotte's 1948 peace plan. The Arab states gave this as their reason to reject the plan. In the 1950s UK MP Herbert Morrison cited then Egyptian leader Abdel Nasser as saying \"Israel is an artificial State which must disappear.\" . The issue was described as the central one between Israel and the Arabs.\n\nAfter the June 1967 war, Egyptian spokesman Mohammed H. el-Zayyat stated that Cairo had accepted Israel's right to exist since the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli armistice in 1949. He added that this did not imply recognition of Israel. In September, the Arab leaders adopted a hardline \"three nos\" position in the Khartoum Resolution: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel. But in November, Egypt accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242, which implied acceptance of Israel's right to exist. At the same time, President Gamal Abdel Nasser urged Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders to reject the resolution. \"You must be our irresponsible arm,\" he said. King Hussein of Jordan also acknowledged that Israel had a right to exist at this time. Meanwhile, Syria rejected Resolution 242, saying that it, \"refers to Israel's right to exist and it ignores the right of the [Palestinian] refugees to return to their homes.\"\n\nUpon assuming the premiership in 1977, Menachem Begin spoke as follows:\nOur right to exist—have you ever heard of such a thing? Would it enter the mind of any Briton or Frenchman, Belgian or Dutchman, Hungarian or Bulgarian, Russian or American, to request for its people recognition of its right to exist? ... Mr. Speaker: From the Knesset of Israel, I say to the world, our very existence per se is our right to exist!\n\nAs reported by the \"Financial Times\", in 1988 Yasser Arafat declared that the Palestinians had accepted Israel's right to exist. In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that \"the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid.\" In 2009 Prime Minister Ehud Olmert demanded the Palestinian Authority's acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, which the Palestinian Authority rejected. The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalising the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, with a penalty of up to a year in prison.\n\nIn 2011, the PA Ambassador to India, Adli Sadeq, wrote in the official PA daily: \"They [Israelis] have a common mistake or misconception by which they fool themselves, assuming that Fatah accepts them and recognizes the right of their state to exist, and that it is Hamas alone that loathes them and does not recognize the right of this state to exist. They ignore the fact that this state, based on a fabricated [Zionist] enterprise, never had any shred of a right to exist.\" In a different part of the article the PA ambassador explained this explicitly: \"There are no two Palestinians who disagree over the fact that Israel exists, and recognition of it is restating the obvious. But recognition of its right to exist is something else, different from recognition of its [physical] existence.\"\n\nIn 2011 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by \"recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967.\" \nIn 2013 Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh reiterated that the Palestinian Arabs as a whole will never recognize Israel: \"We had two wars...but Palestinians did not and will not recognize Israel\".\n\nJohn V. Whitbeck argued that Israel's insistence on a right to exist forces Palestinians to provide a moral justification for their own suffering. Noam Chomsky has argued that no state has the right to exist, that the concept was invented in the 1970s, and that Israel's right to exist can not be accepted by the Palestinians.\n\nInternational law scholar Anthony Carty observed in 2013 that “the question whether Israel has a legal right to exist might appear to be one of the most emotively charged in the vocabulary of international law and politics. It evokes immediately the ‘exterminationist’ rhetoric of numerous Arab and Islamic politicians and ideologues, not least the present President of Iran.\"\n\nRepresentatives of the Kashmiri people regularly assert their right to exist as a nation, independent from both India and Pakistan.\n\nRepresentatives of the Kurdish people regularly assert their right to exist as a nation.\n\nThe constitution of the Irish free state claimed the national territory consisted of the whole of the Island, denying Northern Ireland's right to exist.\n\nSupporters of an autonomous Novorossiya in eastern Ukraine equally argue for a Novorossiyan right to exist. Due to ongoing media controversy around the driving forces behind the unrest in Ukraine, however, the term carries significant weight. RT News reported in December 2014 that Soika, a self-professed 23-year old Slovak volunteer who had then been in Donbass for two months, told them: \"Novorossiya has the right to exist. Although Europe declares the rights of peoples, it recognizes them in a selective manner.\" Euromaidan generally sees the state not as a grassroots movement, but rather as Russian-backed astroturfing.\n\nIn the context of South Korea's and the United States non-recognition of the North Korean state and what the North views as a 'hostile policy' pursued by the US, the North's government frequently accuses the US of denying the 'right of existence' of North Korea. For instance, a 2017 Foreign Ministry statement declared, \"The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence.\" North Korea itself does not recognise the right of existence of the Republic of Korea in the south. \n\nThe League of Nations formally awarded Britain a mandate over Mandatory Palestine in 1922, when Jews made up 11% of the population. The land west of the Jordan River was under direct British administration until 1948, while the land east of the Jordan was a semi-autonomous region known as Transjordan Emirate, and gained independence in 1946. \nIn 1936-39 there was a nationalist uprising by Palestinian Arabs against British colonial rule and mass Jewish immigration into Palestine.\n\nIn 1947, a United Nations General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an \"Arab State\" and a \"Jewish State\" to exist within Palestine in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. This has been described by Prof. Joseph Massad as \"a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require.\" The Jewish Agency, precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected this and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral declaration of independence, support from neighboring Arab states escalated the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The legal and territorial status of Israel and Palestine is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.\n\nIn June 2009 Barack Obama said \"Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.\"\n\nAs reported by \"The New York Times\", in 1988 Yasser Arafat declared that the Palestinians accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which would guarantee \"\"the right to exist in peace and security for all\".\" In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that \"the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid.\"However, the actual wording of the revision only stated the provision would be removed at a future date; the non-recognition of Israel remains in the charter.\n\nIn 2009 Prime Minister Ehud Olmert demanded the Palestinian Authority's acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, which the Palestinian Authority rejected. The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalizing the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, with a penalty of up to a year in prison.\n\nIn 2011, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech to the Dutch parliament in the Hague that the Palestinian people recognize Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by \"recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967.\"\n\nIsraeli government ministers Naftali Bennett and Danny Danon have repeatedly rejected the creation of a Palestinian state, with Bennett stating \"I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state.\" Bennett stated that \"relinquishing control of the West Bank would expose Israel's home front to infiltration tunnels leading into the heartland of Israel,\" citing the case of Gaza as a scenario that could repeat itself. In an August 2011 interview with Teymoor Nabili on Al Jazeera English, Danny Danon said \"There is place only for one state on the land of Israel... I do not believe in a two-state solution.\", reaffirming his stance in June 2013: “Oy vey! Is it such a criminal offense to oppose a two-state solution?” In June 2016 a poll showed that only 4 out of 20 Israeli ministers accepted the state of Palestine's right to exist A poll carried out in 2011 by the Hebrew University indicated that 58% of Israelis and 50% of Palestinians support a two-state solution based on the Clinton Parameters. \nIn 2011 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by \"recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967.\" \nAbbas said he sought United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state only after the Israeli government refused \"the terms of reference of the peace process and the cessation of settlement building\" in the occupied territories.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The SEQUAL framework, which stands for \"semiotic quality framework\" is developed by John Krogstie and others since the 1990s.\n\nThe SEQUAL framework is a so-called \"top-down quality framework\", which is based on semiotic theory, such as the works of Charles W. Morris. Building on these theory it \"defines several quality aspects based on relationships between a model, a body of knowledge, a domain, a modeling language, and the activities of learning, taking action, and modeling\". Its usefulness, according to Mendling et al. (2006), was confirmed in a 2002 experiment by Moody et al.\n\nThe basic idea behind the SEQUAL framework is, that \"conceptual models can be considered as sets of\nstatements in a language, and therefore can be evaluated in semiotic/linguistic terms\". A first semiotic\nframework for evaluating conceptual models was originally proposed by Lindland et al. in the 1994 article \"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling\". In its initial version, it considered three quality levels: \n\nThe framework was later extended, and called the SEQUAL framework by Krogstie et al. in the 1995 article \"Defining quality aspects for conceptual models\". in the 2002 article \"Quality of interactive models\" Krogstie & Jørgensen extended the initial framework adding\nmore levels of Stamper’s semiotic ladder.\n\nModeling is an integral part of many technical fields, including engineering, economics, and software engineering. In this context, a model is a formal representation of an organizational system, such as a business model or a formal description of software in UML.\n\nModel activation, according to John Krogstie (2006), is the process by which a model affects reality. Model activation involves actors interpreting the model and to some extent adjusting their behaviour accordingly. This process can be:\n\nThe Quality Framework works with a set of eight items:\n\nThe three main aspects of physical quality are: \n\n\"Externalization\" is presenting the modeller's concept in some model form for others to make sense of it. Other people can have look on it and can discuss. How other people perceives the model is a matter of internalization. After perceiving the model in their own way they can discuss and change their mind accordingly. To make sense others, it is better to have some model language in common. Physical quality refers to the possibility of externalizing models by using model language that should be available and of course in persistence manner to be internalized by audiences.\n\n\"How available is the model to audience?\" Availability depends on distributability, especially when members of the audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by ordinary mail or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format.\n\nHow persistent is the model, how protected is it against loss or damage? This also includes previous versions of the model, if these are relevant. E.g. for a model on disk, the physical quality will be higher if there is a backup copy, or even higher if this backup is on another disk whose failure is independent of the originals. Similarly, for models on paper, the amount and security of backup copies will be essential.\n\nTo evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: \n\nBasically empirical quality is about the question \"Is the model easily readable?\". Empirical quality deals with the variety of elements distinguished, error frequencies when being written or read, coding (shapes of boxes) and ergonomics for Computer-Human Interaction for documentation and modeling-tools. Ergonomics is the study of workplace design and the physical and psychological impact it has on workers. This quality is related to readability and layout. There are different factors that have an important impact on visual emphasis like size, solidity, foreground/background differences, colour (red attracts the eye more than other colours),change(blinking or moving symbols attract attention), position and so on.\n\nFor graph aesthetics there may be different consideration(Battista, 1994, Tamassia, 1988) like angles between edges not be too small, minimize the number of bends along edges, minimize the number of crossings between edges, place nodes with high degree in the centre of the drawing, have symmetry of sons in hierarchies, have uniform density of nodes in the drawing, have verticality of hierarchical structures and so on.\n\nSyntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are:\n\nWhat is expressed in the model?\nThe semantic goals of this framework are: \n\nPerceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain.\n\nPragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: \n\nThe goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define:\n\nDegree of internalization of existing organizational reality.\n\nActivities for improvement:\n\nTo receive good language quality it is important that:\n\nIf the language quality is good, it will improve the participants' interpretation and other technical actors' interpretation. \nFor additional detail, see the quality of modelling languages\n\nThe organizational quality of the model relates to:\n\nAn alternative quality framework is the \"Guidelines of Modeling\" (GoM) based on general accounting principles. The framework \"include the six principles of correctness, clarity, relevance, comparability, economic efficiency, and systematic design\". It was operationalized for Event-driven Process Chains and also tested in experiments \n\nAn other alternative modelling process quality framework actually based on SEQUAL is the \"Quality of Modelling\" framework (QoMo). QoMo is still a \"preliminary modelling process oriented, based on knowledge state transitions, cost of the activities bringing such transitions about, and a goal structure for activities-for-modelling. Such goals are directly linked to concepts of SEQUAL\".\n\n"}

Equivalently, it is a function space whose elements are functions from the natural numbers to the field K of real or complex numbers. The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in K, and can be turned into a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are linear subspaces of this space. Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a norm, or at least the structure of a topological vector space.\n\nThe most important sequence spaces in analysis are the ℓ spaces, consisting of the \"p\"-power summable sequences, with the \"p\"-norm. These are special cases of L spaces for the counting measure on the set of natural numbers. Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or null sequences form sequence spaces, respectively denoted \"c\" and \"c\", with the sup norm. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence, under which it becomes a special kind of Fréchet space called FK-space.\n\nLet K denote the field either of real or complex numbers. Denote by K the set of all sequences of scalars\nThis can be turned into a vector space by defining vector addition as\nand the scalar multiplication as\nA sequence space is any linear subspace of K.\n\nFor 0 < \"p\" < ∞, ℓ is the subspace of K consisting of all sequences \"x\" = (x) satisfying\nIf \"p\" ≥ 1, then the real-valued operation formula_5 defined by\ndefines a norm on ℓ. In fact, ℓ is a complete metric space with respect to this norm, and therefore is a Banach space.\n\nIf 0 < \"p\" < 1, then ℓ does not carry a norm, but rather a metric defined by\n\nIf \"p\" = ∞, then ℓ is defined to be the space of all bounded sequences. With respect to the norm\nℓ is also a Banach space.\n\nThe space of convergent sequences \"c\" is a sequence space. This consists of all \"x\" ∈ K such that lim\"x\" exists. Since every convergent sequence is bounded, \"c\" is a linear subspace of ℓ. It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.\n\nThe subspace of null sequences \"c\" consists of all sequences whose limit is zero. This is a closed subspace of \"c\", and so again a Banach space.\n\nThe subspace of eventually zero sequences \"c\" consists of all sequences which have only finitely many nonzero elements. This is not a closed subspace and therefore is not a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. For example, the sequence (\"x\") where \"x\" has 1/k for the first n entries and is zero everywhere else (i.e. \"x\" = (1, 1/2, ..., 1/n, 0, ...)) is Cauchy w.r.t. infinity norm but not convergent (to a sequence in \"c\").\n\nThe space of bounded series, denote by bs, is the space of sequences \"x\" for which\nThis space, when equipped with the norm\nis a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to ℓ, via the linear mapping\nThe subspace \"cs\" consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space \"c\" under this isomorphism.\n\nThe space Φ or formula_12 is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with finite support). This set is dense in many sequence spaces.\n\nThe space ℓ is the only ℓ space that is a Hilbert space, since any norm that is induced by an inner product should satisfy the parallelogram law\n\nSubstituting two distinct unit vectors for \"x\" and \"y\" directly shows that the identity is not true unless \"p\" = 2.\n\nEach ℓ is distinct, in that ℓ is a strict subset of ℓ whenever \"p\" < \"s\"; furthermore, ℓ is not linearly isomorphic to ℓ when \"p\" ≠ \"s\". In fact, by Pitt's theorem , every bounded linear operator from ℓ to ℓ is compact when \"p\" < \"s\". No such operator can be an isomorphism; and further, it cannot be an isomorphism on any infinite-dimensional subspace of ℓ, and is thus said to be strictly singular.\n\nIf 1 < \"p\" < ∞, then the (continuous) dual space of ℓ is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ, where \"q\" is the Hölder conjugate of \"p\": 1/\"p\" + 1/\"q\" = 1. The specific isomorphism associates to an element \"x\" of ℓ the functional\nfor \"y\" in ℓ. Hölder's inequality implies that \"L\" is a bounded linear functional on ℓ, and in fact\nso that the operator norm satisfies\nIn fact, taking \"y\" to be the element of ℓ with\ngives \"L\"(\"y\") = ||\"x\"||, so that in fact\nConversely, given a bounded linear functional \"L\" on ℓ, the sequence defined by \"x\" = \"L\"(\"e\") lies in ℓ. Thus the mapping formula_19 gives an isometry\n\nThe map\nobtained by composing κ with the inverse of its transpose coincides with the canonical injection of ℓ into its double dual. As a consequence ℓ is a reflexive space. By abuse of notation, it is typical to identify ℓ with the dual of ℓ: (ℓ) = ℓ. Then reflexivity is understood by the sequence of identifications (ℓ) = (ℓ) = ℓ.\n\nThe space \"c\" is defined as the space of all sequences converging to zero, with norm identical to ||\"x\"||. It is a closed subspace of ℓ, hence a Banach space. The dual of \"c\" is ℓ; the dual of ℓ is ℓ. For the case of natural numbers index set, the ℓ and \"c\" are separable, with the sole exception of ℓ. The dual of ℓ is the ba space.\n\nThe spaces \"c\" and ℓ (for 1 ≤ \"p\" < ∞) have a canonical unconditional Schauder basis {\"e\" | \"i\" = 1, 2,…}, where \"e\" is the sequence which is zero but for a 1 in the \"i\" entry.\n\nThe space ℓ has the Schur property: In ℓ, any sequence that is weakly convergent is also strongly convergent . However, since the weak topology on infinite-dimensional spaces is strictly weaker than the strong topology, there are nets in ℓ that are weak convergent but not strong convergent.\n\nThe ℓ spaces can be embedded into many Banach spaces. The question of whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains an isomorph of some ℓ or of \"c\", was answered negatively by B. S. Tsirelson's construction of Tsirelson space in 1974. The dual statement, that every separable Banach space is linearly isometric to a quotient space of ℓ, was answered in the affirmative by . That is, for every separable Banach space \"X\", there exists a quotient map formula_22, so that \"X\" is isomorphic to formula_23. In general, ker \"Q\" is not complemented in ℓ, that is, there does not exist a subspace \"Y\" of ℓ such that formula_24. In fact, ℓ has uncountably many uncomplemented subspaces that are not isomorphic to one another (for example, take formula_25; since there are uncountably many such \"X\" 's, and since no ℓ is isomorphic to any other, there are thus uncountably many ker \"Q\" 's).\n\nExcept for the trivial finite-dimensional case, an unusual feature of ℓ is that it is not polynomially reflexive.\n\nFor formula_26, the spaces formula_27 are increasing in formula_28, with the inclusion operator being continuous: for formula_29, one has formula_30. \n\nThis follows from defining formula_31 for formula_32, and noting that formula_33 for all formula_34, which can be shown to imply formula_35.\n\n\n"}

L-systems are very important in the field of complexity science and A-life.\nA universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised. \nThe most widely implemented tree-generating algorithms are described in the papers \"Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees\", and Real-Time Tree Rendering\n\nThe realistic modeling of plant growth is of high value to biology, but also for computer games.\n\nA biologist, Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989) worked with yeast and filamentous fungi and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria \"Anabaena catenula\". Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.\nCentral to L-systems, is the notion of rewriting, where the basic idea is to define complex objects by successively replacing parts of a simple object using a set of rewriting rules or productions. The rewriting can be carried out recursively. L-Systems are also closely related to Koch curves.\nA challenge for plant simulations is to consistently integrate environmental factors, such as surrounding plants, obstructions, water and mineral availability, and lighting conditions. \nis to build virtual/environments with as many parameters as computationally feasible, thereby, not only simulating the growth of the plant, but also the environment it is growing within, and, in fact, whole ecosystems.\nChanges in resource availability influence plant growth, which in turn results in a change of resource availability. Powerful models and powerful hardware will be necessary to effectively simulate these recursive interactions of recursive structures. \n\n\"see Comparison of tree generators and A Survey of Modeling and Rendering Trees \n\n\n"}
{"id": "38032018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38032018", "title": "State collapse", "text": "State collapse\n\nState collapse, breakdown, or downfall is the complete failure of a mode of government within a sovereign state. Sometimes this brings about a failed state, as in Somalia and the final decade of Yugoslavia. More often, there is an immediate process of transition to a new administration, and basic services such as tax collection, defence, police, civil service, and courts are maintained throughout, as in South Africa following the failure of the apartheid system.\n\nState collapse may coincide with economic collapse. State collapse is not always synonymous with societal collapse, which often is a more prolonged process, as in the fall of the western Roman Empire. \n\nNot all attempts at regime change succeed in bringing about state collapse. The 16th-century Babington plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I of England, the 19th-century Decembrist revolt in Russia, and the 20th-century Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba failed.\n\nFor Aristotle (384–322 BC), the inherent dangers of democracy were, first, that conflict between the aristocracy and the poor was inevitable; and second, that it would usher in \"mischief and corruption\". Both processes would lead to collapse unless independent controls and separation of powers were enforced. The ancient Greek philosopher Polybius (c.200 – c.118 BC) asserted that all nations follow a cycle of; democracy, oligarchy, dictatorship, tyranny and collapse.\n\nIslamic scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332 – 1406) also produced a general theory of state collapse. A \"theological rationalist\", he transformed the study of history into a \"new science\". In his eyes, dynasties repeatedly become \"sedentary, senile, coercive, pompous, subservient to desire ... liable to divisions in the dynasty.\" Group feeling (asabiyyah, groupthink) disappears as the dynasty grows senile. Ibn Khaldun was fatalistic; \"This senility is a chronic disease which cannot be cured because it is something natural\". He observed that dynasties last for three generations before a new invading clique, \"restless, alert and courageous\", will cause the old to collapse in accordance with the principle in the Book of Exodus, chapter 20, verse four: God \"visits the sins of the fathers onto their children, even unto the third and fourth generation of those that hate Him\". Professor Geoff Mulgan discusses Ibn Khaldun in detail and agrees on the timescale: \"There are obvious parallels between the lifespans of individuals and those of ruling groups.\"\n\nJ.J. Saunders, claiming in 1966 that \"our age, like his, is one of misery\", regrets that Ibn Khaldun had \"no predecessors and no successors ... not until four centuries after his death did he rise from his long sleep.\" In 1868 French Arabists translated the Muqaddimah; \"the world was amazed, but he remained a lonely pioneer without followers ... the world has yet to prove that history can exist independently of the theological setting that gives it meaning\".\n\nThe Japanese philosopher Hajime Tanabe points to the quasi-religious role of the state to mediate between mortal individuals and the eternal universe, so that states regularly collapse; like religious figures, they must undergo a process of death and resurrection. In his view this may account for the perennial popularity of states because they regularly demonstrate their ability to transcend death.\n\nAccording to psychologist Erich Fromm it is possible for an entire nation, if they all share the same vices and errors, to become insane—a \"folie a millions\". Inhuman treatment by the rulers inevitably leads to collapse; Despots and ruling cliques can succeed in dominating and exploiting their fellow man ... but their subjects react ... with apathy, impairment of intelligence, initiative and skills ... or they react by the accumulation of such hate and destructiveness as to bring about an end to themselves, their rulers and their system. ... if man lives under conditions contrary to his nature and to human growth and sanity, he cannot help reacting.' Mark Blyth alleges that a democracy can also collapse \"if voters don't get what they want and merely affirm the status quo.\" In these circumstances, voters deprived of real choice may opt for the least democratic option.\n\nMarina Ottaway discusses the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire in 1918, British India in 1947, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the collapse of South Africa's white supremacist government in 1993, of Czechoslovakia the following year, and of Yugoslavia. Harold Perkin sees \"an acceleration of the process of collapse ... the [20th century] saw the collapse of seven great empires: Imperial China, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Turkey, the Japanese empire, the British Empire, and Russia, twice\". Furthermore, the 20th Century saw the collapse of the French and Portuguese Empires.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith regrets the \"very slight\" amount of research on political power in such cases. Power regularly passes to those who \"assert the unknown with the greatest conviction... not necessarily related to intelligence.\" What we call \"power\" is, \"in practice, the illusion of power.\" Discussing how the \"powerless\" Mahatma Gandhi brought about the collapse of militarily \"powerful\" British India, Galbraith reflects that power, mostly seen as a possession of states and their leaders, would be better viewed as a flow, into and away from \"those instruments that enforce it\".\n\nFew political scientists credibly predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union or agreed on its causes. No one predicted the Arab spring. Though many writings study particular cases of state collapse in isolation, there appears to be no contemporary text which compares events on a global historical basis and identifies common features.\n\nMartin Wight, like Saunders, deplored the \"demonic concentrations of power\" of the defeated countries in the two world wars. A devout Christian, he saw their \"triumphant self-destruction\" as \"Antichrist moments\". He disliked the modern secular tendency to view politics as a succession of questions (the Eastern question, the two-state solution) with \"solutions\" which are devoid of moral content, because The members of international society are, on the whole, immortals. States do die or disappear occasionally, but mostly they outlive the span of human life. They are partnerships of the living with posterity ... A society of immortals will be looser than one of mortals ... there are moral difficulties about indicting a whole nation, because (to do so) would make the passive majority suffer for the acts of the criminal minority, and future generations for the sins of the fathers. \n\nRegarding the idea of a state being immortal, the nation called Russia has survived the collapse of two different political systems: Imperial Russia, a monarchy, in 1917; and the Soviet Union, a communist totalitarianism, in 1991. Likewise, though Germany, ruled by the Nazi Party, was defeated in 1945 and the nation, Germany, was dismembered, it was resurrected in 1990.\n\nExamples of state collapse through civil war include: the War of the Roses in 15th-century England; the Thirty years war (1618–48); the Irish Civil War (1916-22); the Chinese Communist Revolution (1949); and the Cuban Revolution (1958). State collapses through revolutions, not featuring civil war, took place in Imperial China (1911), in Russia (1917), and in Iran (1979). Collapse through \"Coups d'etat\" occurred in Egypt (1952), in Iraq (1958), and in Libya (1969). Negotiated surrenders of power took place in the English Commonwealth (1660); and in the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991), when it fragmented into fifteen independent states.\n\nMediaeval England was the scene of several violent dynastic collapses: the fall of the West Saxon kings, when William the Conqueror defeated Harold Godwinson in 1066; the civil war known as The Anarchy from 1139-1153 between Stephen and Empress Matilda, a time when 'Christ and his saints were asleep', which ended the Norman line of kings; the reign of the last Angevin, John, King of England, known as 'Lackland' for his military incompetence in losing Anjou; the tyranny of the last Plantagenet monarch, Richard II, who was defeated by Henry, duke of Lancaster, later Henry IV; the destruction of the Lancastrian dynasty during the Wars of the Roses, and especially at the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471; and the battle of Bosworth, which saw the end of Richard III and the Yorkist line \n\nThe Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) was a civil war in China between the established Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the Christian millenarian movement of the Heavenly Kingdom of Peace. It was the second-worst conflict in history; 20-30 millions died over 15 years. In 1858-60 the Qing dynasty effectively collapsed as France and the UK invaded and imposed unequal treaties. In 1864 the Taiping regime also collapsed and the dynasty was reshaped in the Tongzhi Restoration.\n\nThe partition of India in 1947 led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. The partition displaced between 10 and 12 million Sikhs, Hindus and Moslems, creating overwhelming refugee crises; there was large-scale violence, with estimates of loss of life accompanying or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.\n\nFailed attempts at reform in the Soviet Union, a standstill economy, and defeat in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Baltic republics and Eastern Europe. Greater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of Glasnost and Perestroika encouraged open criticism of the communist regime. The dramatic drop of the price of oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership. The Reagan administration in the 1980s placed Pershing II missiles in western Europe in order to escalate the Cold War, overstretch the USSR economy and bring about its downfall because 'they can't sustain military spending the way we can'. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when Boris Yeltsin seized power in the aftermath of a failed coup that had attempted to topple Gorbachev. Soviet nuclear weapons were all reassigned to Russia; \n\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia collapsed in the 1990s, when its six socialist republics broke apart to become separate countries; though Slovenia seceded peacefully, civil wars broke out in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, then part of Serbia. Ethnic cleansing and genocide erupted, including the Srebrenica massacre and Bosnian genocide.\n\nThe apartheid system in South Africa ended through negotiations between the governing National Party, the African National Congress, and other political organizations, resulting in South Africa's first non-racial election, which was won by the African National Congress.\nConcerns were raised about the future of its nuclear weapons but they were dismantled.\n\nIn a totalitarian state or an ideocracy, individuals may develop a closed mind and an authoritarian personality, making them more likely to resist threats to the incumbent regime. Psychologists speak of a \"Masada complex\" that may drive fanatics to a suicidal, violent last-ditch stand. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has commented that \"History teaches that dangers are never greater than when empires break up.\"\n\nThe new regime gains power, not through the truth of its doctrines and promises, but through its ability to organize and absorb the frustrated masses. As Pope Francis warned in 2017, \"in times of crisis, we lack judgement\". The timidity of the old regime contrasts with the boldness of those in rebellion against it; \"Where power is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate reckless daring.\" \"The frustrated see in a general downfall an approach to the brotherhood of all. Chaos, like the grave, is a haven of equality.\"\n\nAccording to political scientists, in an ideocracy there must be a ruthless charismatic leader: \"the leader is the movement\", and all individuals are required to submit to, and worship him. \"Followers who lead barren, insecure, frustrated lives obey the leader, not through faith in his vision of a 'Promised land', but because he leads them away from their unwanted selves\". When collapse threatens he may insist on a \"fight to the finish\".\n\nHitler, according to Walter Langer had a Messiah complex and saw himself as the \"Saviour of Germany\" who performed \"miracles\" with the economy. He was unnaturally fond of his mother, to the extent that Germany became a \"mother symbol\". His drive to destroy (the Jews, communism, Europe) was an unconscious attempt to resolve his Oedipus complex and the injustices of his childhood. He \"dismantled the German state ... and replaced it with a war machine\". He was swept along by a tide of events.\n\nMussolini, according to Denis Mack Smith, \"was an actor, playing the part that Italians wanted him to be\". He was vindictive, sadistic, impulsive, proud and cruel, full of \"demonic wilfulness\" and did not know right from wrong. When in 1944 he led a puppet state in northern Italy, he \"divided Italy in two and initiated 18 months of terrible civil war.\" Ken Livingstone has compared Slobodan Milosevic to Hitler for his racism and expansionist goals. Saddam Hussein, who also suffered from a Messiah complex, was similar: \"Hitler was not one of a kind. As long as millions of people passionately long for his return, it is only a matter of time until their wish is fulfilled.\"\n\nNicolae Ceaușescu \"went mad\" as early as 1971 according to John Sweeney, when, \"blind to his own Messianism\", he attempted to recreate North Korean totalitarianism in Romania. He \"played the king\" and the role of \"chosen one\" and \"saviour\". Czar Nicholas II by contrast was deferential. Acceding at an early age, 26, he was untrained in governance. Grand Duke Vladimir's son Cyril was a rival candidate for the throne. Liberals and revolutionaries challenged his autocracy. By 1916 he had become apathetic, dominated by the Czarina and Rasputin, a \"Christ in the image of the rejected and agonizing monarchy\".\n\nIn the case of the USSR, a Marxist Revolutionary wave had formed in which several subordinate regimes in Eastern Europe and Africa collapsed almost simultaneously with the central power. Mikhail Gorbachev saw the USSR as \"on the way to civil war\" and tried to conciliate both reformers and hardliners. He and F.W. De Klerk in South Africa focused on acknowledging and managing decline, rather than \"heroically\" attempting to deny it. They have enjoyed better reputations, although in China, Gorbachev is seen as a dismal failure who capitulated to the West.\n\nState collapse is often a gradual process of slow, imperceptible, generational change. Only the courageous are prepared for speaking truth to power; the majority 'go with the flow', as with Jewish passivity in the face of the creeping corruption of Nazi Germany.\n\nCollapse is often preceded externally by war, and internally by overpopulation and repression. As Paul Kennedy points out, 'Nations in decline instinctively spend more on \"security\" and thus compound their long-term dilemma.' In the case of a revolution the crisis is reached when 'the old regime is no longer able to mobilise force'.\n\nEither the incumbent regime itself, or an extremist reactionary group dissatisfied with its performance, may attempt to postpone or avoid collapse by regenerating popular support; 'At the end of a dynasty there often appears some show of power giving the impression that the dynasty's senility has been made to disappear. It lights up brilliantly just before it is extinguished, like a candle which leaps up brilliantly just before it is put out.' \nTo do so they may have to take 'heroic' measures; 'Throughout history there have always been in the event of defeat two paths of action; the one aims at saving enough of the substance as possible. the other at leaving behind a stirring legend.' According to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, they may rethink or adapt the ideology, or replace it by a completely new set of ideals. For example, in Poland, according to Piekalkiewicz and Penn, communist ideocracy failed in 1980; the recognition of Lech Walesa's Solidarity Trade Union led to a military coup and authoritarian military rule.\n\nAccording to Sabrina Ramet, regenerative changes occurred in Yugoslavia in the 1980s when the communist ideology was replaced by a nationalist drive for a Greater Serbia and by an anti-bureaucratic revolution in support of Slobodan Milosevic \nThe Young Turk coup of 1908, the 1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt, and the financial/industrial reforms of Sergei Witte in Imperial Russia, were all aimed at regenerating causes which were nearing collapse.\n\nWhen collapse - whether through civil war, revolution, coup d'état, or military defeat and/or invasion - becomes unavoidable and immediate, law and order may break down. There may be Ethnic cleansing or Genocide. Hitler ordered the killing of invalids, Gypsies, Russians and Jews in the Final solution. In Ottoman Turkey, estimates for the death toll in the Armenian genocide vary between 300,000 and 1.5 million.\n\nIn the Pacific theatre of World War II, Japan's collapse was hastened by nuclear destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nWhen Ottoman Turkey collapsed at the end of World War I, it lost territory, including what became Syria, Iraq and Palestine; the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire gave rise to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Austrian Republic, while Slovenia and Croatia became part of Yugoslavia]]. Nazi Germany in 1945 fragmented into East and West Germany, while Pomerania and Silesia became part of Poland\n\nIn 1946, the Diet ratified a new Constitution of Japan The new constitution drafted by Americans allowed access and control over the Japanese military through MacArthur and the Allied occupation on Japan. \"The political project drew much of its inspiration from the U.S. Bill of Rights, New Deal social legislation, the liberal constitutions of several European states and even the Soviet Union.\"\n\nRecovery from collapse is often improved by formal or informal efforts at justice, such as the Nuremberg trials and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa). Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein were also tried in court, but Mussolini and Colonel Gaddafi were murdered by mobs.\n\nThe collapse of the Ottomans in 1918 had long-term consequences, 'triggering most of the problems that plague the Middle East today.' Hegemony in the Middle East has been subject to quarrels between British, French, Zionist, American, Arab nationalist, Saudi and Iranian interests ever since.\n\nHitler, says Sebastian Haffner, 'whether we like it or not', created many features of the postwar world, including the state of Israel, the end of European empires, the division of Germany, and the joint hegemony of the US and USSR.\n\nPaul Stares and Helia Aghani suggest that Saudi Arabia could lapse into a succession crisis and civil war if Mohammed bin Salman's accession is contested after the death of his aging father, king Salman. Lebanon and Jordan could collapse following the influx of refugees from Syria and the resultant burden on infrastructure.\n\nIn 2003, Colonel Gaddafi of Libya agreed to dismantle his nuclear and chemical weapons programme. In 2011 he was deposed and murdered. This is the reason, according to Forbes magazine, for North Korea to seek to guarantee its security and invulnerability through continuing its nuclear weapons programme. Tom Embury-Dennis claims that North Korea could collapse \"within a year\" as new US sanctions take effect.\nIn Venezuela, protests and riots against the authoritarian rule of Nicolas Maduro have steadily increased since 2014, while the economy and social infrastructure have worsened.\n\nEmmanuel Todd, one of the first to predict the fall of the USSR, now predicts the collapse of the US in his book \"\". According to Iranian general Reza Naqdi, the US will collapse by 2035 and the Trump presidency is hastening that process. Margaret McMillan has compared President Trump to Mussolini, on the grounds that President Trump similarly seeks attention, makes grand gestures, plays the 'strong man' and seeks out enemies.\n\nNigel Lawson predicts that the European Union will become a federal superstate; also likely to collapse, according to the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, journalist Stephen Pollard, German economist Thorsten Polleit, and a leaked German Government contingency plan.\n\nS Daniel Abraham anticipates the collapse of Israel, where Palestinians will soon outnumber Jews, if the Palestinian problem is not resolved; Iqbal Jassat compares the situation to apartheid in South Africa. A secret CIA report sees the end of Israel by 2022. In Pakistan, Islamic militants are allegedly infiltrating the military and nuclear weapons systems. There are fears of collapse into nuclear war with India, or of chaos enabling extremists to seize weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGordon G. Chang, in editions of \"The Coming Collapse of China\", has made several predictions of collapse, none of which have materialised. Bruce Gilley sees a largely peaceful process unfolding. David Shambaugh says China must either liberalise to become a developed economy–as Taiwan and South Korea have–or else remain authoritarian and endure a stagnating economy. \"We cannot predict when Chinese communism will collapse, but it is hard not to conclude that we are seeing its final phases.\"\n\nMark Katz suggests that the Islamic fundamentalist revolutionary wave led by Iran could collapse, but \"must first expand significantly\" and then experience a \"crisis of confidence\".\n\nGeoff Mulgan has called for; \"new structures of government above the nation-state... this task is essential for Human survival\".\n\nThere are many semi-fictional books and films, which dramatically demonstrate the turbulent effects of collapse upon innocent or naive individuals. Bernardo Bertolucci's film, \"The Last Emperor\", showed the collapse of both Imperial China and Manchukuo, as well as the post-collapse trial and rehabilitation of Pu Yi. Bruno Ganz played Hitler in \"Downfall\", which depicts the final days of Germany's Third Reich. Events from the period,\nas seen by prisoners at Auschwitz, are shown in Primo Levi's memoir, \"If This Is a Man\", and in the graphic novels \"Maus\" and \"Maus II\". Kurt Vonnegut witnessed the bombing of Dresden and fictionalized the experience in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\".\n\nRobert K. Massie's book about the last Russian tsar, \"Nicholas and Alexandra\", was also filmed. \"Doctor Zhivago\" and \"And Quiet Flows the Don\" (filmed as \"War and Revolution\") relate stories of families caught up in the collapse of Russia. \"The House of the Mosque\" and \"Persepolis\" depict the collapse of Iran.\n\nThe \"Left Behind\" series of novels by \"Tim LaHaye\" and \"Jerry B. Jenkins\" features the supposed role of Israel in the apocalyptic End Times. In the spy novel, \"The Mask of Dimitrios\" (1939), Eric Ambler comments: \"In a dying civilization, political prestige goes not to the man with the shrewdest diagnosis, but to the one with the best bedside manner.\"\n"}

The following year the club took the name 'The Caledonian Hunt Club'. The Duke of Hamilton was to be the President of the Club and the Countess Eglinton was to be the Patron. As the name implied the club was originally constituted to hunt, with the first fortnight long meeting set to take place at Haddington on 12 October 1778. However, it seemed that the club was also concerned from the beginning with horse racing. One year after it was instituted the club held races at Musselburgh. Two years after it was instituted the Caledonian Hunt club sponsored its first race at the Racecourse in Kelso. So it was, that the club met twice a year at Kelso, using the Cross Keys Hotel as their meeting point. Over time the frequency of their meets increased, in both Edinburgh and elsewhere. A Hunt Ball was held, a notable example of which was the ball of 1787, for which the Edinburgh Assembly Rooms were opened for the first time. In 1786 a Yorkshire Colonel visited the club and remarked:\n\nAlthough the club became based in Edinburgh, the location of its race meetings varied each year, with Kelso playing host most often. Although the club had a choice of 8 different courses in Scotland, they only chose Aberdeen once.\n\nAround 1787 Robbie Burns met with members of the Caledonia Hunt Club, having befriended a number of members around Edinburgh. Burns dedicated the first Edinburgh Edition of his Poems to the Hunt. To return the favour the treasurer of the Caledonia Hunt Club was instructed to \"subscribe for one hundred copies in their name, for which he should pay Mr Burns £25, upon the publication of his book.\" By 1792 Burns was himself a member of the Caledonia Hunt Club. A portrait of Robbie Burns was given to the club by the famous engraver William Walker. The print is now property of the British museum.\n\nIn 1822 as part of his visit to Edinburgh King George IV attended the Caledonian Hunt Club's annual ball. He was so struck with the meeting that he agreed to be the patron of the club, permitting them to use the title 'Royal'. Nathaniel Gow provided the music for the event, but refused to charge the club, having been so pleased by the response of the King to his music.\n\nSince the patronage of 1822, several other monarchs and royals have been involved with the club, including William IV, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and Edward VII.\n\nIn addition to Robbie Burns, the Royal Caledonia Hunt Club seems to have inspired the works of other artists. For example, The Caledonian Hunt, by Sir Alexander Don in 1780 and the Royal Caledonian Hunt's Delight, written by Mr James Miller in 1792 (later given words by Robbie Burns); and North's (Milles Macphail) Farewell to the Caledonian Hunt published as part of the Gow collection.\n"}

Marketers always try to create a segmentation of the market in order to focus their product offering. Segmentation can be done on demographic, behavioral, or other bases. According to this segmentation, different options of differentiation vis-à-vis the competition get evaluated and implemented. This is called positioning of the product. McCarthy’s 4 marketing P’s, product, placement, promotion, and pricing are repeatedly used to create good combination of product features at the right price, distributed via preferred distribution channels, and combined with an appealing promotion.\n\nOne aspect tends to be forgotten: purchase timing behaviour or simply, timing aspect. Time marketing researches and gives guidelines on when to position a product in the market. Not only competition, but also absolute time frames in a consumer’s life are considered.\n\nAn obvious example, known for years before any research was conducted on this matter, illustrates the importance of timing aspects in marketing. A fan is a typical example of a product that goes on sale according to laws of nature and therefore timing. In summer, department stores have promotions on fans, as higher temperatures urge consumers to purchase.\n\nResearch has found that products are bought by customers at different moments of the day and different days of the week.

{"id": "20647654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20647654", "title": "Trickster", "text": "Trickster\n\nIn mythology, and in the study of folklore and religion, a trickster is a character in a story (god, goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphisation), which exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge, and uses it to play tricks or otherwise disobey normal rules and conventional behaviour.\n\nTricksters are archetypal characters who appear in the myths of many different cultures. Lewis Hyde describes the trickster as a \"boundary-crosser\". The trickster crosses and often breaks both physical and societal rules. Tricksters \"...violate principles of social and natural order, playfully disrupting normal life and then re-establishing it on a new basis.\"\n\nOften, the bending/breaking of rules takes the form of tricks or thievery. Tricksters can be cunning or foolish or both. The trickster openly questions and mocks authority. They are usually male characters, and are fond of breaking rules, boasting, and playing tricks on both humans and gods.\n\nAll cultures have tales of the trickster, a crafty creature who uses cunning to get food, steal precious possessions, or simply cause mischief. In some Greek myths Hermes plays the trickster. He is the patron of thieves and the inventor of lying, a gift he passed on to Autolycus, who in turn passed it on to Odysseus. In Slavic folktales, the trickster and the culture hero are often combined.\n\nFrequently the trickster figure exhibits gender and form variability. In Norse mythology the mischief-maker is Loki, who is also a shape shifter. Loki also exhibits gender variability, in one case even becoming pregnant. He becomes a mare who later gives birth to Odin's eight-legged horse Sleipnir.\n\nBritish scholar Evan Brown suggested that Jacob in the Bible has many of the characteristics of the trickster:The tricks Jacob plays on his twin brother Esau, his father Isaac and his father-in-law Laban are immoral by conventional standards, designed to cheat other people and gain material and social advantages he is not entitled to. Nevertheless, the Biblical narrative clearly takes Jacob's side and the reader is invited to laugh and admire Jacob's ingenuity–as is the case with the tricksters of other cultures\".\n\nIn a wide variety of African language communities, the rabbit, or hare, is the trickster. In West Africa (and thence into the Caribbean via the slave trade), the spider (Anansi) is often the trickster.\n\nThe trickster or clown is an example of a Jungian archetype. In modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a stock character. Often too, the trickster is distinct in a story by his acting as a sort of catalyst, in that his antics are the cause of other characters' discomfiture, but he himself is left untouched. A once-famous example of this was the character Froggy the Gremlin on the early children's television show \"Andy's Gang\". A cigar-puffing puppet, Froggy induced the adult humans around him to engage in ridiculous and self-destructive hi-jinks.\n\nIn later folklore, the trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and deceit as a defense. He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. For example, many typical fairy tales have the king who wants to find the best groom for his daughter by ordering several trials. No brave and valiant prince or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes. With the help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners. Therefore, the most unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward. More modern and obvious examples of that type include Bugs Bunny and Pippi Longstocking.\n\nModern African American literary criticism has turned the trickster figure into an example of how it is possible to overcome a system of oppression from within. For years, African American literature was discounted by the greater community of American literary criticism while its authors were still obligated to use the language and the rhetoric of the very system that relegated African Americans and other minorities to the ostracized position of the cultural \"other.\" The central question became one of how to overcome this system when the only words available were created and defined by the oppressors. As Audre Lorde explained, the problem was that \"the master's tools [would] never dismantle the master's house.\"\n\nIn his writings of the late 1980s, Henry Louis Gates Jr. presents the concept of Signifyin'. Wound up in this theory is the idea that the \"master's house\" can be \"dismantled\" using his \"tools\" if the tools are used in a new or unconventional way. To demonstrate this process, Gates cites the interactions found in African American narrative poetry between the trickster, the Signifying Monkey, and his oppressor, the Lion. According to Gates, the \"Signifying Monkey\" is the \"New World figuration\" and \"functional equivalent\" of the Eshu trickster figure of African Yoruba mythology. The Lion functions as the authoritative figure in his classical role of \"King of the Jungle.\" He is the one who commands the Signifying Monkey's movements. Yet the Monkey is able to outwit the Lion continually in these narratives through his usage of figurative language. According to Gates, \"[T]he Signifying Monkey is able to signify upon the Lion because the Lion does not understand the Monkey's discourse…The monkey speaks figuratively, in a symbolic code; the lion interprets or reads literally and suffers the consequences of his folly...\" In this way, the Monkey uses the same language as the Lion, but he uses it on a level that the Lion cannot comprehend. This usually leads to the Lion's \"trounc[ing]\" at the hands of a third party, the Elephant. The net effect of all of this is \"the reversal of [the Lion's] status as the King of the Jungle.\" In this way, the \"master's house\" is dismantled when his own tools are turned against him.\nFollowing in this tradition, critics since Gates have come to assert that another popular African American folk trickster, Br'er Rabbit (a contraction of \"Brother Rabbit\"), uses clever language to perform the same kind of rebellious societal deconstruction as the Signifying Monkey. Brer Rabbit is the \"creative way that the slave community responded to the oppressor's failure to address them as human beings created in the image of God.\" The figurative representative of this slave community, Brer Rabbit is the hero with a \"fragile body but a deceptively strong mind\" that allows him to \"create [his] own symbols in defiance of the perverted logic of the oppressor.\" By twisting language to create these symbols, Brer Rabbit not only was the \"personification of the ethic of self-preservation\" for the slave community, but also \"an alternative response to their oppressor's false doctrine of anthropology.\" Through his language of trickery, Brer Rabbit outwits his oppressors, deconstructing, in small ways, the hierarchy of subjugation to which his weak body forces him to physically conform.\n\nBefore Gates, there was some precedent for the analysis of African American folk heroes as destructive agents of an oppressive hierarchical system. In the 1920s and 1930s, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound engaged in an epistolary correspondence. Both writers signed the letters with pseudonyms adopted from the Uncle Remus tales; Eliot was \"Possum;\" Pound was \"Tar Baby.\" Pound and Eliot wrote in the same \"African slave\" dialect of the tales. Pound, writing later of the series of letters, distinguished the language from \"the Queen's English, the language of public propriety.\" This rebellion against proper language came as part of \"collaboration\" between Pound and Eliot \"against the London literary establishment and the language that it used.\" Although Pound and Eliot were not attempting to overthrow an establishment as expansive as the one oppressing the African American slave community, they were actively trying to establish for themselves a new kind of literary freedom. In their usage of the Uncle Remus trickster figures' names and dialects, they display an early understanding of the way in which cleverly manipulated language can dismantle a restrictive hierarchy.\n\nAfrican American literary criticism and folktales are not the only place in the American literary tradition that tricksters are to be found combating subjugation from within an oppressive system. In \"When Brer Rabbit Meets Coyote\", the argument is posited that the Brer Rabbit stories were derived from a mixture of African and Native American mythology, thus attributing part of the credit for the formation of the tales and wiles of Brer Rabbit to \"Indian captivity narratives\" and the rabbit trickster found in Cherokee mythology. In arguing for a merged \"African–Native American folklore\", the idea is forwarded that certain shared \"cultural affinities\" between African Americans and Native Americans allowed both groups \"through the trickster tales…survive[d] European American cultural and political domination.\"\n\nWhile the trickster crosses various cultural traditions, there are significant differences between tricksters in the traditions of different parts of the world:\n\nMany native traditions held clowns and tricksters as essential to any contact with the sacred. People could not pray until they had laughed, because laughter opens and frees from rigid preconception. Humans had to have tricksters within the most sacred ceremonies for fear that they forget the sacred comes through upset, reversal, surprise. The trickster in most native traditions is essential to creation, to birth.\n\nNative American tricksters should not be confused with the European fictional picaro. One of the most important distinctions is that \"we can see in the Native American trickster an openness to life's multiplicity and paradoxes largely missing in the modern Euro-American moral tradition\". In some stories the Native American trickster is foolish and other times wise. He can be a hero in one tale and a villain in the next.\n\nIn many Native American and First Nations mythologies, the Coyote spirit (Southwestern United States) or Raven spirit (Pacific Northwest) stole fire from the gods (stars, moon, and/or sun). Both are usually seen as jokesters and pranksters. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches.\n\nWakdjunga in Winnebago mythology is an example of the trickster archetype.\n\nThe Coyote mythos is one of the most popular among western Native American cultures, especially among indigenous peoples of California and the Great Basin.\n\nAccording to Crow (and other Plains) tradition, Old Man Coyote impersonates the Creator: \"Old Man Coyote took up a handful of mud and out of it made people\". He also bestowed names on buffalo, deer, elk, antelopes, and bear. According to A. Hultkranz, the impersonation of Coyote as Creator is a result of a taboo, a mythic substitute to the religious notion of the Great Spirit whose name was too dangerous and/or sacred to use apart from at special ceremonies.\n\nIn Chelan myths, Coyote belongs to the animal people but he is at the same time \"a power just like the Creator, the head of all the creatures.\" while still being a subject of the Creator who can punish him or remove his powers. In the Pacific Northwest tradition, Coyote is mostly mentioned as a messenger, or minor power.\n\nAs the culture hero, Coyote appears in various mythic traditions, but generally with the same magical powers of transformation, resurrection, and \"medicine\". He is engaged in changing the ways of rivers, creating new landscapes and getting sacred things for people. Of mention is the tradition of Coyote fighting against monsters. According to Wasco tradition, Coyote was the hero to fight and kill Thunderbird, the killer of people, but he could do that not because of his personal power, but due to the help of the Spirit Chief. In some stories, Multnomah Falls came to be by Coyote's efforts; in others, it is done by Raven.\n\nMore often than not Coyote is a trickster, but always different. In some stories, he is a noble trickster: \"Coyote takes water from the Frog people... because it is not right that one people have all the water.\" In others, he is malicious: \"Coyote determined to bring harm to Duck. He took Duck's wife and children, whom he treated badly.\"\n\nIn online environments there has been a link between the trickster and Internet trolling. Some have said that a trickster is a type of online community character.\n\n\n"}

This word also refers to \"manas\" or mind. This word has its root in the term, bhū ( भू), meaning – 'become', 'arise', 'come into existence'; thus \"vibhu\" means – 'expand', 'become manifest', 'appear', 'pervade'.\n\nFrom Atharvaveda it is learnt that Sudhanvan Angirasa had three sons, Ribhu, Vibhu and Vaja, collectively known as Ribhus who were intelligent sages. They carried the luminous power of knowledge to this world, which knowledge pervaded the world as nectar. Ribhu or Ribhukshan was skillful at handling knowledge; Vibhu or Vibhawa was skillful in pervading and diffusing, and Vaja handled embodied plenitude with similar skill; all three dwelled in the solar-region and are considered to be the rays of the sun. They are the three leaders of rites and the possessors of opulence, and the three deities of several Rig Vedic hymns.\n\nA mantra of the Rig Veda reads as follows:-\n\nIn the Rig Veda, the word, \"vibhu\", means – 'all-pervading unified entity that permeates or extends throughout a spatial expanse', as is in the afore-cited mantra wherein the phrase - एकस्य चिन्मे विभ्वस्त्वोजः which means - \" Though I be but one, let my might be extensive. \" Though the words, \"vibhu\" and \"prabhu\", appear in the Rig Veda but these words have a fixed psychological significance – \"vibhu\" means - 'coming into existence to pervade the whole being as \"ānanda\", and \"prabhu\" means - 'coming into existence as a specific object or particular experience within the range of one’s consciousness'. A sage of the Rig Veda (II.xxiv.11) asserts that:-\n\nBrihaspati, the lord of the heaven of light and the guardian of \"rta\", is present in all things and beings (\"vibhu\") same as the Brahman of the Vedanta.\n\nIn the Kaushitaki Upanishad, while describing the world of Brahman, there is the mention of the hall of Brahman called \"Vibhu\" (or built by \"Vibhu\" here meaning – 'egoism') arriving at which hall the glory of Brahman reaches the one who seeks liberation, where the seeker thinks himself to be Brahman, and thinking thus approaches the throne \"Vikakshanā\" ('perception'), in other words, the seeker having become liberated experiences Brahman, his own true nature. Gaudapada in his \"kārikā\" on the Mandukya Upanishad stating:-\n\ndescribes the fourth state (\"turiya\") as the ordainer (\"iśana\"), as the supreme lord (\"prabhu\"), as the non-dual (\"advaita\") and the all-pervading (\"vibhu\") god (\"devata\") of all beings. Here, the word, \"avyaya\", means that which is not subject to change; and \"turiya\" is \"vibhu\" because it pervades all the three states.\n\nAccording to all six orthodox Vedic \"darśanas\" which comprise Hindu philosophy, with the exception of Ramanuja’s 'theory of atomic dimensionless soul', the \"ātmān\" is \"vibhu\" ('omnipresent'). The followers of Jainism, who believe that the \"ātmān\" assumes the size corresponding to the size of the body it occupies, also believe that in the final state of liberation it remains unalterable, but they reject the Hindu theory of \"vibhu\" which to them does not explain if the soul is same at all times everywhere why for is there the experience individual self. Vedāntists argue that for the atman to be unchangeable in the state of liberation then it must be regarded either as \"anu\" ('minute') or as \"vibhu\" ('pervasive'). The contention of the Yoga school that the \"jivatman\" and the \"paramatman\" are both mere consciousnesses and both are all-pervading (\"vibhu\") and that \"moksha\" is merely the cessation of pain is also refuted – एतेन योगः प्रत्युक्तः (Brahma Sutras II.i.3).\n\nAdvaita Vedanta rests on the premise that only the substratum (Brahman) is real, the phenomenal world all with its properties and relations is unreal and due to \"maya\". Substance, in its pure subtle state is the constitutive cause of things, and in its rational state it is the substratum of qualities, actions, etc., and exists in nine forms – earth (\"prithivi\"), water (\"jala\"), fire (\"agni\"), air (\"vayu\"), space (\"akasha\") ('which five constitute the physical world'), direction (\"disha\") ('without which no movement is not possible'), time (\"kaal\") ('the substratum and the causal factor of all psycho-physical product and worldly behaviour'), mind (\"manas\") and self (\"ātmān\"); the first four and mind are \"paramanus\" ('infinitesimal') and the rest are \"vibhu\" ('ubiquitous'), simple and infinite. Vindhyāvāsī, giving up the doctrine of the three psychical organs, associates the processes of the faculty of knowledge (\"buddhi\") and I-consciousness with the thinking organ (\"manah\") which three were the great all –penetrating \"vibhu\". Vyasa too held mind (\"citta\") to be all-penetrating (\"vibhu\"). Shankara explains that \" the Self (Brahman), which is by nature all-pervasive (\"vibhu\") assumes the form and qualities of the \"buddhi\" when apparently moving in the cycle of empirical existence. \" Brahman, who is omnipresent (\"sarvagata\"), is without attributes; Brahman with attributes is Ishvara, who is \"vibhu\" possessing \"mahāmāyā\", and who through his diverse powers creates all this diversity experienced through the senses.\n"}
{"id": "246891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246891", "title": "Y chromosome", "text": "Y chromosome\n\nThe Y chromosome is one of two sex chromosomes (allosomes) in mammals, including humans, and many other animals. The other is the X chromosome. Y is the sex-determining chromosome in many species, since it is the presence or absence of Y that determines the male or female sex of offspring produced in sexual reproduction. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains the gene SRY, which triggers testis development. The DNA in the human Y chromosome is composed of about 59 million base pairs. The Y chromosome is passed only from father to son. With a 30% difference between humans and chimpanzees, the Y chromosome is one of the fastest-evolving parts of the human genome. To date, over 200 Y-linked genes have been identified. All Y-linked genes are expressed and (apart from duplicated genes) hemizygous (present on only one chromosome) except in the cases of aneuploidy such as XYY syndrome or XXYY syndrome. \n\nThe Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the mealworm \"Tenebrio molitor\". Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. She realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome \"Y\" simply to follow on from Henking's \"X\" alphabetically.\n\nThe idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter \"Y\" is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.\n\nMost mammals have only one pair of sex chromosomes in each cell. Males have one Y chromosome and one X chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. In mammals, the Y chromosome contains a gene, SRY, which triggers embryonic development as a male. The Y chromosomes of humans and other mammals also contain other genes needed for normal sperm production.\n\nThere are exceptions, however. For example, the platypus relies on an XY sex-determination system based on five pairs of chromosomes. Platypus sex chromosomes have strong sequence similarity with the avian Z chromosome, (indicating close homology), and the SRY gene so central to sex-determination in most other mammals is apparently not involved in platypus sex-determination. Among humans, some men have two Xs and a Y (\"XXY\", see Klinefelter syndrome), or one X and two Ys (see XYY syndrome), and some women have three Xs or a single X instead of a double X (\"X0\", see Turner syndrome). There are other exceptions in which SRY is damaged (leading to an XY female), or copied to the X (leading to an XX male). \n\nMany ectothermic vertebrates have no sex chromosomes. If they have different sexes, sex is determined environmentally rather than genetically. For some of them, especially reptiles, sex depends on the incubation temperature; others are hermaphroditic (meaning they contain both male and female gametes in the same individual).\n\nThe X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved from a pair of identical chromosomes, termed autosomes, when an ancestral animal developed an allelic variation, a so-called \"sex locus\" – simply possessing this allele caused the organism to be male. The chromosome with this allele became the Y chromosome, while the other member of the pair became the X chromosome. Over time, genes that were beneficial for males and harmful to (or had no effect on) females either developed on the Y chromosome or were acquired through the process of translocation.\n\nUntil recently, the X and Y chromosomes were thought to have diverged around 300 million years ago. However, research published in 2010, and particularly research published in 2008 documenting the sequencing of the platypus genome, has suggested that the XY sex-determination system would not have been present more than 166 million years ago, at the split of the monotremes from other mammals. This re-estimation of the age of the therian XY system is based on the finding that sequences that are on the X chromosomes of marsupials and eutherian mammals are present on the autosomes of platypus and birds. The older estimate was based on erroneous reports that the platypus X chromosomes contained these sequences.\n\nRecombination between the X and Y chromosomes proved harmful—it resulted in males without necessary genes formerly found on the Y chromosome, and females with unnecessary or even harmful genes previously only found on the Y chromosome. As a result, genes beneficial to males accumulated near the sex-determining genes, and recombination in this region was suppressed in order to preserve this male specific region. Over time, the Y chromosome changed in such a way as to inhibit the areas around the sex determining genes from recombining at all with the X chromosome. As a result of this process, 95% of the human Y chromosome is unable to recombine. Only the tips of the Y and X chromosomes recombine. The tips of the Y chromosome that could recombine with the X chromosome are referred to as the pseudoautosomal region. The rest of the Y chromosome is passed on to the next generation intact, allowing for its use in tracking human evolution.\n\nBy one estimate, the human Y chromosome has lost 1,393 of its 1,438 original genes over the course of its existence, and linear extrapolation of this 1,393-gene loss over 300 million years gives a rate of genetic loss of 4.6 genes per million years. Continued loss of genes at the rate of 4.6 genes per million years would result in a Y chromosome with no functional genes – that is the Y chromosome would lose complete function – within the next 10 million years, or half that time with the current age estimate of 160 million years. Comparative genomic analysis reveals that many mammalian species are experiencing a similar loss of function in their heterozygous sex chromosome. Degeneration may simply be the fate of all non-recombining sex chromosomes, due to three common evolutionary forces: high mutation rate, inefficient selection, and genetic drift.\n\nHowever, comparisons of the human and chimpanzee Y chromosomes (first published in 2005) show that the human Y chromosome has not lost any genes since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees between 6–7 million years ago, and a scientific report in 2012 stated that only one gene had been lost since humans diverged from the rhesus macaque 25 million years ago. These facts provide direct evidence that the linear extrapolation model is flawed and suggest that the current human Y chromosome is either no longer shrinking or is shrinking at a much slower rate than the 4.6 genes per million years estimated by the linear extrapolation model.\n\nThe human Y chromosome is particularly exposed to high mutation rates due to the environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during gametogenesis. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation than the rest of the genome. The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.\n\nWithout the ability to recombine during meiosis, the Y chromosome is unable to expose individual alleles to natural selection. Deleterious alleles are allowed to \"hitchhike\" with beneficial neighbors, thus propagating maladapted alleles in to the next generation. Conversely, advantageous alleles may be selected against if they are surrounded by harmful alleles (background selection). Due to this inability to sort through its gene content, the Y chromosome is particularly prone to the accumulation of \"junk\" DNA. Massive accumulations of retrotransposable elements are scattered throughout the Y. The random insertion of DNA segments often disrupts encoded gene sequences and renders them nonfunctional. However, the Y chromosome has no way of weeding out these \"jumping genes\". Without the ability to isolate alleles, selection cannot effectively act upon them.\n\nA clear, quantitative indication of this inefficiency is the entropy rate of the Y chromosome. Whereas all other chromosomes in the human genome have entropy rates of 1.5–1.9 bits per nucleotide (compared to the theoretical maximum of exactly 2 for no redundancy), the Y chromosome's entropy rate is only 0.84. This means the Y chromosome has a much lower information content relative to its overall length; it is more redundant.\n\nEven if a well adapted Y chromosome manages to maintain genetic activity by avoiding mutation accumulation, there is no guarantee it will be passed down to the next generation. The population size of the Y chromosome is inherently limited to 1/4 that of autosomes: diploid organisms contain two copies of autosomal chromosomes while only half the population contains 1 Y chromosome. Thus, genetic drift is an exceptionally strong force acting upon the Y chromosome. Through sheer random assortment, an adult male may never pass on his Y chromosome if he only has female offspring. Thus, although a male may have a well adapted Y chromosome free of excessive mutation, it may never make it in to the next gene pool. The repeat random loss of well-adapted Y chromosomes, coupled with the tendency of the Y chromosome to evolve to have more deleterious mutations rather than less for reasons described above, contributes to the species-wide degeneration of Y chromosomes through Muller's ratchet.\n\nAs it has been already mentioned, the Y chromosome is unable to recombine during meiosis like the other human chromosomes; however, in 2003, researchers from MIT discovered a process which may slow down the process of degradation.\nThey found that human Y chromosome is able to \"recombine\" with itself, using palindrome base pair sequences. Such a \"recombination\" is called gene conversion.\n\nIn the case of the Y chromosomes, the palindromes are not noncoding DNA; these strings of bases contain functioning genes important for male fertility. Most of the sequence pairs are greater than 99.97% identical. The extensive use of gene conversion may play a role in the ability of the Y chromosome to edit out genetic mistakes and maintain the integrity of the relatively few genes it carries. In other words, since the Y chromosome is single, it has duplicates of its genes on itself instead of having a second, homologous, chromosome. When errors occur, it can use other parts of itself as a template to correct them.\n\nFindings were confirmed by comparing similar regions of the Y chromosome in humans to the Y chromosomes of chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas. The comparison demonstrated that the same phenomenon of gene conversion appeared to be at work more than 5 million years ago, when humans and the non-human primates diverged from each other.\n\nIn the terminal stages of the degeneration of the Y chromosome, other chromosomes increasingly take over genes and functions formerly associated with it. Finally, the Y chromosome disappears entirely, and a new sex-determining system arises. Several species of rodent in the sister families Muridae and Cricetidae have reached these stages, in the following ways:\nOutside of the rodents, the black muntjac, \"Muntiacus crinifrons\", evolved new X and Y chromosomes through fusions of the ancestral sex chromosomes and autosomes.\n\nFisher's principle outlines why almost all species using sexual reproduction have a sex ratio of 1:1. W. D. Hamilton gave the following basic explanation in his 1967 paper on \"Extraordinary sex ratios\", given the condition that males and females cost equal amounts to produce:\n\nMany groups of organisms in addition to mammals have Y chromosomes, but these Y chromosomes do not share common ancestry with mammalian Y chromosomes. Such groups include \"Drosophila\", some other insects, some fish, some reptiles, and some plants. In \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the Y chromosome does not trigger male development. Instead, sex is determined by the number of X chromosomes. The \"D. melanogaster\" Y chromosome does contain genes necessary for male fertility. So XXY \"D. melanogaster\" are female, and \"D. melanogaster\" with a single X (X0), are male but sterile. There are some species of Drosophila in which X0 males are both viable and fertile.\n\nOther organisms have mirror image sex chromosomes: where the homogeneous sex is the male, said to have two Z chromosomes, and the female is the heterogeneous sex, and said to have a Z chromosome and a W chromosome. For example, female birds, snakes, and butterflies have ZW sex chromosomes, and males have ZZ sex chromosomes.\n\nThere are some species, such as the Japanese rice fish, the XY system is still developing and cross over between the X and Y is still possible. Because the male specific region is very small and contains no essential genes, it is even possible to artificially induce XX males and YY females to no ill effect.\n\nIn humans, the Y chromosome spans about 58 million base pairs (the building blocks of DNA) and represents approximately 1% of the total DNA in a male cell. The human Y chromosome contains over 200 genes, at least 72 of which code for proteins. Traits that are inherited via the Y chromosome are called Y-linked, or holandric traits.\n\nSome cells, especially in older men and smokers, lack a Y chromosome. It has been found that men with a higher percentage of hematopoietic stem cells in blood lacking the Y chromosome (and perhaps a higher percentage of other cells lacking it) have a higher risk of certain cancers and have a shorter life expectancy. Men with \"loss of Y\" (which was defined as no Y in at least 18% of their hematopoietic cells) have been found to die 5.5 years earlier on average than others. This has been interpreted as a sign that the Y chromosome plays a role going beyond sex determination and reproduction (although the loss of Y may be an effect rather than a cause). And yet women, who have no Y chromosome, have lower rates of cancer. Male smokers have between 1.5 and 2 times the risk of non-respiratory cancers as female smokers.\n\nThe human Y chromosome is normally unable to recombine with the X chromosome, except for small pieces of pseudoautosomal regions at the telomeres (which comprise about 5% of the chromosome's length). These regions are relics of ancient homology between the X and Y chromosomes. The bulk of the Y chromosome, which does not recombine, is called the \"NRY\", or non-recombining region of the Y chromosome. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this region are used to trace direct paternal ancestral lines. \n\nThe following are some of the gene count estimates of human Y chromosome. Because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies (for technical details, see gene prediction). Among various projects, the collaborative consensus coding sequence project (CCDS) takes an extremely conservative strategy. So CCDS's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein-coding genes.\n\nIn general, the human Y chromosome is extremely gene poor—it is one of the largest gene deserts in the human genome. Disregarding pseudoautosomal genes, genes encoded on the human Y chromosome include:\n\n\nDiseases linked to the Y chromosome typically involve an aneuploidy, an atypical number of chromosomes. \n\nY chromosome microdeletion (YCM) is a family of genetic disorders caused by missing genes in the Y chromosome. Many affected men exhibit no symptoms and lead normal lives. However, YCM is also known to be present in a significant number of men with reduced fertility or reduced sperm count.\n\nThis results in the person presenting a female phenotype (i.e., is born with female-like genitalia) even though that person possesses an XY karyotype. The lack of the second X results in infertility. In other words, viewed from the opposite direction, the person goes through defeminization but fails to complete masculinization.\n\nThe cause can be seen as an incomplete Y chromosome: the usual karyotype in these cases is 45X, plus a fragment of Y. This usually results in defective testicular development, such that the infant may or may not have fully formed male genitalia internally or externally. The full range of ambiguity of structure may occur, especially if mosaicism is present. When the Y fragment is minimal and nonfunctional, the child is usually a girl with the features of Turner syndrome or mixed gonadal dysgenesis.\n\nKlinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) is not an aneuploidy of the Y chromosome, but a condition of having an extra X chromosome, which usually results in defective postnatal testicular function. The mechanism is not fully understood; it does not seem to be due to direct interference by the extra X with expression of Y genes.\n\n47, XYY syndrome (simply known as XYY syndrome) is caused by the presence of a single extra copy of the Y chromosome in each of a male's cells. 47, XYY males have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes, for a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Researchers have found that an extra copy of the Y chromosome is associated with increased stature and an increased incidence of learning problems in some boys and men, but the effects are variable, often minimal, and the vast majority do not know their karyotype.\n\nIn 1965 and 1966 Patricia Jacobs and colleagues published a chromosome survey of 315 male patients at\nScotland's only special security hospital for the developmentally disabled,\nfinding a higher than expected number of patients to have an extra Y chromosome. The authors of this study wondered \"whether an extra Y chromosome predisposes its carriers to unusually aggressive behaviour\", and this conjecture \"framed the next fifteen years of research on the human Y chromosome\".\n\nThrough studies over the next decade, this conjecture was shown to be incorrect: the elevated crime rate of XYY males is due to lower median intelligence and not increased aggression, and increased height was the only characteristic that could be reliably associated with XYY males. The \"criminal karyotype\" concept is therefore inaccurate.\n\nThe following Y-chromosome-linked diseases are rare, but notable because of their elucidating of the nature of the Y chromosome.\n\nGreater degrees of Y chromosome polysomy (having more than one extra copy of the Y chromosome in every cell, e.g., XYYY) are rare. The extra genetic material in these cases can lead to skeletal abnormalities, decreased IQ, and delayed development, but the severity features of these conditions are variable.\n\nXX male syndrome occurs when there has been a recombination in the formation of the male gametes, causing the SRY portion of the Y chromosome to move to the X chromosome. When such an X chromosome contributes to the child, the development will lead to a male, because of the SRY gene.\n\nIn human genetic genealogy (the application of genetics to traditional genealogy), use of the information contained in the Y chromosome is of particular interest because, unlike other chromosomes, the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son, on the patrilineal line. Mitochondrial DNA, maternally inherited to both sons and daughters, is used in an analogous way to trace the matrilineal line.\n\nResearch is currently investigating whether male-pattern neural development is a direct consequence of Y-chromosome-related gene expression or an indirect result of Y-chromosome-related androgenic hormone production.\n\nThe presence of male chromosomes in fetal cells in the blood circulation of women was discovered in 1974.\n\nIn 1996, it was found that male fetal progenitor cells could persist postpartum in the maternal blood stream for as long as 27 years.\n\nA 2004 study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, investigated the origin of male chromosomes found in the peripheral blood of women who had not had male progeny. A total of 120 subjects (women who had never had sons) were investigated, and it was found that 21% of them had male DNA. The subjects were categorised into four groups based on their case histories:\n\nThe study noted that 10% of the women had never been pregnant before, raising the question of where the Y chromosomes in their blood could have come from. The study suggests that possible reasons for occurrence of male chromosome microchimerism could be one of the following:\n\nA 2012 study at the same institute has detected cells with the Y chromosome in multiple areas of the brains of deceased women.\n\n\n"}
