{"id": "25102839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25102839", "title": "Assemblage (composition)", "text": "Assemblage (composition)\n\nAssemblage refers to a text \"built primarily and explicitly from existing texts to solve a writing or communication problem in a new context\". The concept was first proposed by Johndan Johnson-Eilola (author of \"Datacloud\") and Stuart Selber in the journal \"Computers & Composition\" in 2007. The notion of assemblages builds on remix and remix practices, which blur distinctions between invented and borrowed work.\n\nJohnson-Eilola and Selber write that assemblage is influenced by intertextuality and postmodernism. The authors discuss the intertextual nature of writing and assert that participation in existing discourse necessarily means that composition cannot occur separate from that discourse. They state that \"productive participation involves appropriation and re-appropriation of the familiar\" in a manner that conforms to existing discourse and audience expectations. In reference to intertextuality, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite \"The Social Life of Information\" by John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid. In this book Brown and Duguid state that the meaning of and use for a text is directly influenced both by its source texts and the broader textual context in which it participates. Building upon this notion, Johnson-Eilola and Selber position assemblage as a style of composition situated within postmodernism. They state that \"in a general sense, postmodern theories, and following them, cultural studies, offer a useful way of understanding assemblages (and the related process of remixing) as simultaneously social and textual structures.\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber suggest that texts should always be treated as assemblages since composition is often highly intertextual.\n\nJohnson-Eilola and Selber believe that composition should be undertaken as a problem solving activity rather than a demonstration of original ideas. They write that \"writing situations are, at base, problem-solving situations in one way or another,\" and offer assemblage as a form of problem solving that can be used alongside the creation of original text. Michael J. Michaud writes that \"assemblages are ubiquitous in contemporary workplaces\" where problem solving is paramount because assemblage allows authors to \"meet discursive needs and to get work done.\" He further argues that students with workplace experience often transfer assemblage writing into the composition classroom. Assemblage allows such authors to alter existing texts and combine them with original work in order to meet the demands of a writing situation or problem.\n\nThe idea of assemblages is closely tied to the practice of remix. Remix, originally referring to a reworked song, has been extended to describe any significant alteration of media, most commonly film and literature. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that remix \"can aid invention, leverage intellectual and physical resources, and dramatize the social dimensions of composing.\" However, they also recognize that \"remixing as a form of composition inhabits a contested terrain of creativity, intellectual property, authorship, corporate ownership, and power.\" While the practice of remixing is often marked by legal issues, the authors acknowledge that remix is nevertheless becoming an increasingly common creative form.\n\nWhile assemblage is closely tied to remix, there are distinctions between the two. In discussing models of writing, Liane Robertson, Kara Taczak, and Kathleen Blake Yancey describe remix models of writing as \"prior knowledge revised synthetically to \"incorporate\" new concepts and practices into the prior model of writing.\" In contrast, they define assemblage models as “grafting...isolated ‘bits’ of learning onto [a] prior structure without either recognition of differences between prior and current writing conceptions and tasks or synthesis of them.\" While a remix is a synthesis or incorporation of elements, an assemblage is a combination in which there are recognizable boundaries between elements.\n\nAssemblage and remix are also related to articulation. The sociological practice of articulation, as described by Antonio Gramsci and Stuart Hall, among others, refers to the appropriation of elements of culture by various social groups. Johnson-Eilola and Selber connect assemblage, remix, and articulation as examples of meaning being situated in a specific material and social context.\n\nA central characteristic of assemblages is the challenge to established notions of originality. Johnson-Eilola and Selber claim that the traditional distinction between original and plagiarized work is that original work is superior in terms of creative effort and is not derivative. They further assert that such a distinction is based upon outdated notions of \"the lone genius\" and is no longer practical in an academic setting. While they concede that \"teachers no longer evaluate writing completely as an isolated, decontextualized artifact,\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber maintain \"at least one set of social forces suggests to students that using citations and quotations from source materials will be valued less than their own original text, a situation that may encourage them to conceal their sources.\" While the current system of academic evaluation allows, and actually calls, for citation of source materials, Johnson-Eilola and Selber find that the placement of value on original work encourages students to hide sources in an attempt to demonstrate original thought. The emphasis on original work, according to Johnson-Eilola and Selber, may actually contribute to plagiarism. The authors believe that the emphasis on original work is unnecessary because \"rhetorical purposes can be addressed in context by either original or borrowed/quoted texts without a hierarchy of distinction between the two.\"\n\nJohnson-Eilola and Selber assert that despite shifting attitudes in academia, work produced by students at the scholastic and collegiate level is still evaluated in terms of its originality. They find fault with the current evaluative process for two reasons. First, the authors find that evaluating students for their originality is \"increasingly unrealistic in our postmodern age\" as this method is based on antiquated ideas of creativity. Second, they treat the idea of isolating a student's unique composition from the inspiring source materials as unrealistic and futile. For Johnson-Eilola and Selber, the ability to effectively contribute to academic or social discourse is what makes an assemblage valuable, not its \"originality.\" Rather than claiming originality is not to be valued, the authors see it as fundamentally problematic and misleading as an evaluative concept. They suggest that academic evaluation be reconsidered with a new emphasis on affect: \"What if the 'final' product a student produces—a text—is not concerned with original words or images on a page or screen but concerned primarily with assemblages of parts? Importantly, in this reconception, the assemblages do not distinguish primarily between which parts are supposed to be original and which have been found and gathered from someplace else; assemblages are interested in what works, what has social effects.\" In this model, the role of intertextuality is recognized as central to the composition of \"new\" material.\n\nIn support for their argument against the traditional view of plagiarism, Johnson-Eilola and Selber cite current critiques from other scholars. They refer to Price, who argued that plagiarism cannot be defined as a single concept, but is dependent upon the cultural practice and conventions in a given situation. They also acknowledge a presentation given by James Porter in 2006 at CCCC. In his presentation Porter described how plagiarism is sometimes encouraged in the academic community, offering examples of \"ways teachers plagiarize all the time—among them, sharing syllabi (with plagiarized plagiarism statements!), using boilerplate text for administrative documents, and failing to acknowledge the bibliographic work of others.\" Johnson-Eilola and Selber also refer to a 1993 article by Rebecca Moore Howard on \"patchwriting,\" which describes a technique used by new authors. Patchwriting \"involves copying from a source text then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-to-one synonym-substitutes.\" This technique can traditionally be viewed as a form of plagiarism, but it is also considered useful for learning how to communicate within expert discourse. Johson-Eilola and Selber reference patchwriting in an attempt to demonstrate the practical uses of otherwise \"plagiaristic\" practices, not to establish a connection between patchwriting and assemblage. While patchwriting can be a useful learning tool, it is completely distinct from assemblage. Assemblage is more than the systematic replacement of like terms and is closer to the artistic style of collage.\n\nParadox, a cut up collage assembled from words and phrases cut from magazines and glued together to form a picture of Abraham Lincoln being assassinated at Ford's Theater.\n\n"}

These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any term or subformula of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be free, or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term.\n\nGiven that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is countably infinite, an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be defined recursively. A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be \"finitely axiomatized\". Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant, even if they are less practical for deductive work.\n\nTwo very well known instances of axiom schemata are the:\nCzesław Ryll-Nardzewski proved that Peano arithmetic cannot be finitely axiomatized and Richard Montague proved that ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized. Hence, the axiom schemata cannot be eliminated from these theories. This is also the case for quite a few other axiomatic theories in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, etc.\n\nAll theorems of ZFC are also theorems of von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, but the latter can be finitely axiomatized. The set theory New Foundations can be finitely axiomatized, but only with some loss of elegance.\n\nSchematic variables in first-order logic are usually trivially eliminable in second-order logic, because a schematic variable is often a placeholder for any property or relation over the individuals of the theory. This is the case with the schemata of \"Induction\" and \"Replacement\" mentioned above. Higher-order logic allows quantified variables to range over all possible properties or relations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31276033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31276033", "title": "Bradley's regress", "text": "Bradley's regress\n\nBradley's Regress is a philosophical problem concerning the nature of relations. It is named after F. H. Bradley who discussed the problem in his 1893 book \"Appearance and Reality\". It bears a close kinship to the issue of the unity of the proposition.\n\nBradley raises the problem while discussing the bundle theory of objects, according to which an object is merely a \"bundle\" of properties. This theory raises the question of how the various properties that together comprise an object are related when they in fact comprise an object. More generally, the question that arises is what has to be the case for any two things to be related. Bradley's Regress appears to show that the notion of two things being related generates an infinite regress. \n\nSuppose, for example, that \"a\" respects \"b\". This state of affairs seems to involve three things: \"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting. For the state of affairs of \"a\" respecting \"b\" to obtain, it doesn't, however, suffice that these three things (\"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting) exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might say, is that \"a\" and \"b\" \"stand in\" the relation of respecting. But now we seem to have another state of affairs: the state of affairs of \"a\" and \"b\" standing in the relation of respecting. This state of affairs in turn seems to involve four things: \"a\", \"b\", the relation of respecting, and the relation of standing in. Again, however, for it to be the case that \"a\" and \"b\" stand in the relation of respecting, it doesn't suffice that these four items exist. They must also be related in some way. What is required, we might now say, is that \"a\", \"b\", and the relation of respecting stand in the relation of standing in. And so on, ad infinitum.\n\nIn \"Appearance and Reality\", Bradley seems to conclude that the regress should lead us to abandon the idea that relations are \"independently real\". One way to take this suggestion is as recommending that in the case of a respecting b, we are dealing with a state of affairs that has only two constituents: a and b. It does not, in addition, involve a third item, \"the relation of respecting\", to which a and b must then bear some further relation (\"standing in\").\n\nA different option is to accept that the regress is real, but to deny that it is a vicious regress.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "83987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83987", "title": "Camp (style)", "text": "Camp (style)\n\nCamp is an aesthetic style and sensibility that regards something as appealing because of its bad taste and ironic value. Camp aesthetics disrupt many of modernism's notions of what art is and what can be classified as high art by inverting aesthetic attributes such as beauty, value, and taste through an invitation of a different kind of apprehension and consumption.\n\nCamp can also be a social practice. For many it is considered a style and performance identity for several types of entertainment including film, cabaret, and pantomime. Where high art necessarily incorporates beauty and value, camp necessarily needs to be lively, audacious and dynamic. \"Camp aesthetics delights in impertinence.\" Camp opposes satisfaction and seeks to challenge.\n\nCamp art is related to—and often confused with—kitsch, and things with camp appeal may also be described as \"cheesy\". When the usage appeared in 1909, it denoted \"ostentatious, exaggerated, affected, theatrical\", or \"effeminate\" behaviour, and by the middle of the 1970s, the definition comprised \"banality, mediocrity, artifice, [and] ostentation ... so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal\". The American writer Susan Sontag's essay \"Notes on 'Camp'\" (1964) emphasized its key elements as: artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and 'shocking' \"excess\". Camp as an aesthetic has been popular from the 1960s to the present.\n\nCamp aesthetics were popularized by filmmakers George and Mike Kuchar, Jack Smith and his film \"Flaming Creatures\", and later John Waters, including the last's \"Pink Flamingos\", \"Hairspray\", and \"Polyester\". Celebrities that are associated with camp personas include drag queens and performers such as Dame Edna Everage, Divine, RuPaul, Paul Lynde, and Liberace. Camp was a part of the anti-academic defence of popular culture in the 1960s and gained popularity in the 1980s with the widespread adoption of postmodern views on art and culture. Television programs as varied as \"Doctor Who\", \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", and \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" have been described as camp.\n\nIn 1909, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gave the first print citation of \"camp\" as\n\nAccording to the dictionary, this sense is \"etymologically obscure\". \"Camp\" in this sense has been suggested to have possibly derived from the French term \"se camper\", meaning \"to pose in an exaggerated fashion\". Later, it evolved into a general description of the aesthetic choices and behaviour of working-class homosexual men. Finally, it was made mainstream, and adjectivized, by Susan Sontag in a landmark essay (see below).\n\nThe rise of post-modernism made \"camp\" a common perspective on aesthetics, which was not identified with any specific group. The attitude was originally a distinctive factor in pre-Stonewall gay male communities, where it was the dominant cultural pattern. It originated from the acceptance of gayness as effeminacy. Two key components of camp were originally feminine performances: swish and drag. With swish featuring extensive use of superlatives, and drag being exaggerated female impersonation, camp became extended to all things \"over the top\", including women posing as female impersonators (faux queens), as in the exaggerated Hollywood version of Carmen Miranda. It was this version of the concept that was adopted by literary and art critics and became a part of the conceptual array of 1960s culture. Moe Meyer still defines \"camp\" as \"queer parody\".\n\nMuch of the cult following of camp today grew rapidly during the transition from black-and-white to colour television in the early 1960s. Network programming during that time sought entertainment content that would display the new medium with the use of bright colours and high stylization. The concept of the comicbook superhero (an individual in a highly stylized, outlandish and possibly impractical costume avenging otherwise serious matters such as murder) could be interpreted as camp. However, since it was aimed initially at children, it is camp only in a secondary perspective. It was not until the 1960s television version of \"Batman\" (one of the more famous examples of camp in popular culture, 1966–1968) that the link was made explicit, with the inherent ridiculousness of the concept exposed as a vehicle for comedy. The villains of series as divergent as \"Batman\" and \"The Mod Squad\" (1968–1973) were costumed as to take advantage of new colours and changing fashion styles, in ways that took advantage of camp. \n\nIronically, even \"Batman\" fell victim to contemporaneous parodies, with the release of \"Captain Nice\" and \"Mr. Terrific\", which layered extra camp onto the already overladen superhero concept. The stylized content of \"Batman\" may have possibly jump-started television campiness, to circumvent the strict censorship of comics at this time (after Dr. Fredric Wertham's essay \"Seduction of the Innocent\" which led to the comics' industry-sponsored Comics Code), as the \"Batman\" comic books were very dark and noirish until the 1950s and from the 1970s onwards.\n\nTelevision series such as \"The Avengers\" (1961–1969), \"The Addams Family\", \"The Munsters\" (both 1964–1966), \"Gilligan's Island\" (1964–1967), \"Lost in Space\" (1965–1968), \"The Wild Wild West\" (1965–1969), \"Get Smart\" (1965–1970), \"Are You Being Served?\" (1972–1985), \"Charlie's Angels\" (1976–1981), \"Fantasy Island\" (1977–1984) and \"CHiPs\" (1977–1983) are enjoyed into the 21st century for what are interpreted as their \"camp\" aspects. Some of these series were developed 'tongue-in-cheek' by their producers.\n\nIn a \"Monty Python\" sketch of their television show (Episode 22, \"Camp Square-Bashing\", repeated in their film \"And Now for Something Completely Different\", 1971), the British Army's 2nd Armoured Division has a Military \"Swanning About\" Precision Drill unit in which soldiers \"camp it up\" in unison.\n\nTV soap operas, especially those that air in primetime, are often considered camp. The over-the-top excess of \"Dallas\" (1978–1991) and \"Dynasty\" (1981–1989) were popular in the 1980s. The Channel 4 series \"Eurotrash\" (1993–2004) was a television programme produced using the inherent ridiculousness of its subject matter for comedic effect, often using camp dubbing in regional accents and overexaggerated stereotypical characterisations (such as an aristocratic artist based on Brian Sewell) to puncture the interviewees' pretence of seriousness. However, an obituary to Lolo Ferrari was given straight dubbing as a mark of respect at odds with its irreverence. However, the subject matter would have offended many British viewers and fallen foul of OFCOM if it was done with any seriousness. Again, this is an example of doing a programme in a camp manner to get around the likelihood of censorship. Mentos television commercials during the 1990s developed a cult following due to their camp \"Eurotrash\" humour. In the Season 8 episode \"Homer's Phobia\" (1997) of the American animated comedy series \"The Simpsons\", gay secondary character John (played by gay director John Waters) defines to Homer Simpson the meaning of the word \"camp\" to be \"tragically ludicrous\", or \"ludicrously tragic\": Homer gives a misinterpreted example of \"camp\" as \"when a clown dies\".\n\nThe Comedy Central television show \"Strangers with Candy\" (1999–2000), starring comedian Amy Sedaris, was a camp spoof of the \"ABC Afterschool Special\" genre. The ESPN Classic show \"Cheap Seats without Ron Parker\" (2004–2006) featured two Generation-X, real-life brothers making humorous observations while watching televised camp sporting events, which had often been featured on \"ABC's Wide World of Sports\" during the 1970s. Examples include a 1970s sport that attempted to combine ballet with skiing (ski ballet), the Harlem Globetrotters holding a televised exhibition game at the notorious Attica State Prison in upstate New York, small-time regional professional wrestling and roller derby. The television series \"Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" (2007–2010) is a current example of camp, using inspiration from Public-access television productions, early morning infomercials, and the use of celebrity status in telethons and other televised charity appeals.\n\nSome classic films noted for their camp tone include:\n\nFilms such as \"Valley of the Dolls\" (1967), \"Mommie Dearest\" (1981), \"Showgirls\" (1995), and \"Burlesque\" (2010) gained camp status primarily due to the filmmakers' attempting to produce a serious film that wound up unintentionally comedic. Award-winning actresses, like Patty Duke in \"Valley of the Dolls\" and Faye Dunaway in \"Mommie Dearest\", gave such over-the-top performances that the films became camp classics, especially attracting fanfare from gay, male audiences.\n\nThe second part of the 1978 movie \"Superman\" set in fictional Metropolis takes on a campy screwball tone after the seriousness of the origin story.\n\nEducational and industrial films form an entire subgenre of camp films, with the most famous being the much-spoofed 1950s \"Duck and Cover\" film, in which an anthropomorphic, cartoon turtle explains how one can survive a nuclear attack by hiding under a school desk. Its British counterpart \"Protect and Survive\" could be seen as kitsch, even though it is very chilling to watch (it was never shown on grounds of national security and would only be broadcast if an attack was deemed likely within 72 hours). Many British Public Information Films gained a camp cult following, such as the famous Charley Says series. Charley's voice is performed by the camp surrealist comedian and Radio DJ Kenny Everett, who came from an advertising background as a copywriter.\n\nSome films are intentionally and consciously camp, such as \"The Toxic Avenger\" (1984) and \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (1994). Quentin Tarantino's black comedy crime film \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) has also fallen into this category, with film critic Nicholas Christopher calling it \"more gangland Camp than neo-noir\". In British cinema the archetypal camp film cult is the outrageous long-running, 30-film \"Carry On\" series (1958–1978). Another cult is built around \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975). \"Preaching to the Perverted\" (1997), written and directed by Stuart Urban, broke out of traditional British comedy style to portray the fetish and BDSM scene under assault from Christian crusaders and the authorities. It portrayed both the fetish scene and the Establishment in a cartoon, stylized visual manner. Lambasted by most traditional critics, lauded by gay, music and fashion press, it went on to build a lasting cult reputation.\n\nMovie versions of camp TV shows in recent years have made the camp nature of these shows a running gag throughout the films. In \"Grizzly Man\" (2005), a documentary by Werner Herzog, the protagonist, Timothy Treadwell, describes the wild life of bears with camp mannerisms. Inspired by the work of George Kuchar and his brother Mike Kuchar, ASS Studios, launched in 2011 by Courtney Fathom Sell and Jen Miller, began making a series of short, no-budget camp films. Their feature film \"Satan, Hold My Hand\" (2013) features many elements recognized in camp pictures.\n\nAmerican singer and actress Cher is often called the \"Queen of Camp\" due to her outrageous fashion and live performances. She gained that status in the 1970s when she was heavily present on American prime time television with her variety shows on which she was collaborating with the famous costume designer Bob Mackie.\n\nDusty Springfield is a camp icon. In public and on stage, Springfield developed a joyful image supported by her peroxide blonde beehive hairstyle, evening gowns, and heavy make-up that included her much-copied \"panda eye\" mascara. Springfield borrowed elements of her look from blonde glamour queens of the 1950s, such as Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, and pasted them together according to her own taste. Her ultra-glamorous look made her a camp icon and this, combined with her emotive vocal performances, won her a powerful and enduring following in the gay community. Besides the prototypical female drag queen, she was presented in the roles of the \"Great White Lady\" of pop and soul and the \"Queen of Mods\". More recently South Korean rapper Psy known for his viral internet music videos full of flamboyant dance and visuals has come to be seen as a 21st-century incarnation of camp style.\n\nSome challenge the perceived 'whiteness' of camp aesthetics, noting barriers for gender exploration in queer black communities relative to white LGBT communities. Uri McMillan identifies Nicki Minaj as a contemporary black icon of camp.\n\nRetro-camp fashion is an example of modern hipsters employing camp styles for the sake of humour. Yard decorations, popular in some parts of suburban and rural America, are examples of kitsch and are sometimes displayed as camp expressions. The classic camp yard ornament is the pink plastic flamingo. The yard globe, garden gnome, wooden cut-out of a fat lady bending over, the statue of a small black man holding a lantern (called a lawn jockey) and ceramic statues of white-tailed deer are also prevalent camp lawn decorations.\n\nThe Carvel chain of soft-serve ice cream stores is famous for its camp style, camp low-budget TV commercials and camp ice-cream cakes such as Cookie Puss and Fudgie The Whale.\n\nThe words \"camp\" and \"kitsch\" are often used interchangeably; both may relate to art, literature, music, or any object that carries an aesthetic value. However, \"kitsch\" refers specifically to the work itself, whereas \"camp\" is a mode of performance. Thus, a person may consume kitsch intentionally or unintentionally. Camp, as Susan Sontag observed, is always a way of consuming or performing culture \"in quotation marks.\"\n\nHowever, Sontag also distinguishes the difference between \"naive\" and \"deliberate\" camp. Kitsch, as a form or style, certainly falls under the category \"naive camp\" as it is unaware that it is tasteless; \"deliberate camp\", on the other hand, can be seen as a subversive form of kitsch which deliberately exploits the whole notions of what it is to be kitsch. (Sontag, 1964)\n\nThomas Hine identified 1954–1964 as the campiest period in modern US history. During this time, Americans had more money to spend, thanks to the post-war economic boom; but they often exercised poor taste. In the UK, on the other hand, camp is an adjective, often associated with a stereotypical view of feminine gay men. The term has been in common use for many decades. Gay comedian Kenneth Williams wrote in a diary entry for 1 January 1947: \"Went to Singapore with Stan—very camp evening, was followed, but tatty types so didn't bother to make overtures.\" Although it applies to gay men, it is a specific adjective used to describe a man that openly promotes the fact that he is gay by being outwardly garish or eccentric, for example, the character Daffyd Thomas in the English comedy skit show \"Little Britain\". \"Camp\" forms a strong element in UK culture, and many so-called gay-icons and objects are chosen as such because they are camp. People like Kylie Minogue, John Inman, Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen, Lulu, Graham Norton, Mika, Lesley Joseph, Ruby Wax, Dale Winton, Cilla Black, and the music hall tradition of the pantomime are camp elements in popular culture. The British tradition of the \"Last Night of the Proms\" has been said to glory in nostalgia, camp, and pastiche. Thomas Dworzak published a collection of portrait photographs of Taliban soldiers, found in Kabul photo studios. The \"Taliban\" book shows a campy esthetics, quite close to the gay movement in California or a Peter Greenaway film.\n\nThe Australian theatre and opera director Barrie Kosky is renowned for his use of camp in interpreting the works of the Western canon including Shakespeare, Wagner, Molière, Seneca, Kafka and his 2006 eight-hour production for the Sydney Theatre Company \"The Lost Echo\", based on Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and Euripides' \"The Bacchae\". In the first act (\"The Song of Phaeton\"), for instance, the goddess Juno takes the form of a highly stylized Marlene Dietrich, and the musical arrangements feature Noël Coward and Cole Porter. Kosky's use of camp is also effectively employed to satirize the pretensions, manners, and cultural vacuity of Australia's suburban middle class, which is suggestive of the style of Dame Edna Everage. For example, in \"The Lost Echo\" Kosky employs a chorus of high school girls and boys: one girl in the chorus takes leave from the goddess Diana, and begins to rehearse a dance routine, muttering to herself in a broad Australian accent, \"Mum says I have to practise if I want to be on \"Australian Idol\".\" See also the works of Australian writer/director Baz Luhrmann, in particular \"Strictly Ballroom\".\n\nSince 2000, the Eurovision Song Contest, an annually televised competition of song performers from different countries, has shown an increased element of camp—since the contest has shown an increasing attraction within the gay communities—in their stage performances, especially during the televised finale, which is screened live across Europe. As it is a visual show, many Eurovision performances attempt to attract the attention of the voters through means other than the music, which sometimes leads to bizarre onstage gimmicks, and what some critics have called \"the Eurovision kitsch drive\", with almost cartoonish novelty acts performing.\n\nThe first post-World War II use of the word in print, marginally mentioned in the Sontag essay, may be Christopher Isherwood's 1954 novel \"The World in the Evening\", where he comments: \"You can't camp about something you don't take seriously. You're not making fun of it; you're making fun \"out\" of it. You're expressing what's basically serious to you in terms of fun and artifice and elegance.\" In the American writer Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp'\", Sontag emphasized artifice, frivolity, naïve middle-class pretentiousness, and shocking excess as key elements of camp. Examples cited by Sontag included Tiffany lamps, the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Swan Lake\", and Japanese science fiction films such as \"Rodan\", and \"The Mysterians\" of the 1950s.\n\nIn Mark Booth's 1983 book \"Camp\" he defines camp as \"to present oneself as being committed to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits.\" He carefully discerns the distinction between genuine camp, and \"camp fads and fancies\", things that are not intrinsically camp, but display artificiality, stylization, theatricality, naivety, sexual ambiguity, tackiness, poor taste, stylishness, or portray camp people, and thus appeal to them. He considers Sontag's definition problematical because it lacks this distinction.\n\nAs a cultural challenge, camp can also receive a political meaning, when minorities appropriate and ridicule the images of the dominant group, the kind of activism associated with multiculturalism and the New Left. The best known instance of this is the gay liberation movement, which used camp to confront society with its own preconceptions and their historicity. The first positive portrayal of a gay secret agent in fiction appears in a series, \"The Man from C.A.M.P.\" in which the protagonist is, paradoxically, effeminate yet physically tough. Female camp actresses such as Mae West, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, and Joan Crawford also had an important influence on the development of feminist consciousness: by exaggerating certain stereotyped features of femininity, such as fragility, open emotionality or moodiness, they attempted to undermine the credibility of those preconceptions. The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.\n\nAs a part of its adoption by the mainstream, camp has undergone a softening of its original subversive tone, and is often little more than the recognition that popular culture can also be enjoyed by a sophisticated sensibility. Mainstream comic books and B Westerns, for example, have become standard subjects for academic analysis. The normalisation of the outrageous, common to many Vanguardist movements—has led some critics to argue the notion has lost its usefulness for critical art discourse.\n\nAccording to the sociologist Andrew Ross, camp engages in a redefinition of cultural meaning through a juxtaposition of an outmoded past alongside that which is technologically, stylistically, and sartorially contemporary. Often characterized by the reappropriation of a \"throwaway Pop aesthetic\", camp works to intermingle the categories of \"high\" and \"low\" culture. Objects may become camp objects because of their historical association with a power now in decline. As opposed to kitsch, camp reappropriates culture in an ironic fashion, whereas kitsch is indelibly sincere. Additionally, kitsch may be seen as a quality of an object, while camp, \"tends to refer to a subjective process.\" Those who identify objects as “camp” commemorate the distance mirrored in the process through which, \"unexpected value can be located in some obscure or exorbitant object.\" The effect of camp's irony is problematic, insofar as the agents of cultural redefinition are often of upper- or middle-class standing who could, \"afford, literally, to redefine the life of consumerism and material affluence as a life of spiritual poverty.\"\n\nCamp-style performances may allow certain prejudices to be perpetuated by thinly veiling them as irony. Some feminist critics argue that drag queens are misogynistic because they make women seem ridiculous and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. This criticism posits that drag queens are the gay equivalent of the black and white minstrel. Some critics claim that camp comedians like Larry Grayson, Kenny Everett, Duncan Norvelle and Julian Clary perpetuate gay stereotypes and pander to homophobia. This sign of a privileged cultural position left the lower-class standing incapable of any cultural redefinition, thereby relegating them to a static position which could then only be lifted by those with enough capital.\n\nCamp aesthetics became the curious site of personal liberation from the stranglehold of the corporate, capitalist state. Within the capitalist environment of constant consumption, camp rediscovers history's waste, bringing back objects thought of as refuse or of bad taste. Camp liberates objects from the landfills of history and reinvokes them with a new charisma. In doing so camp creates an economy separate from that of the state. In Ross's words, camp, \"is the re-creation of surplus value from forgotten forms of labor.\" \n\nThis is perhaps why camp often faces criticism from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, the most obvious argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar to be recognized as valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the \"yuck factor\". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, \"it's good because it's awful.\" \n\nFrom flea markets to thrift stores, the 'bad taste' of camp has been increasingly reinculcated with the cultural capital that it had intended to break away from. In an attempt to \"present a challenge to the mechanisms of control and containment that operate in the name of good taste\", the camp aesthetic has fallen flat on its face and has been appropriated by artists such as Macklemore with his hit single \"Thrift Shop\". Yet, his fame is only enjoyed at the expense of others, as Ross writes, \"it [the pleasure of camp] is the result of the (hard) work of a producer of taste and 'taste' is only possible through exclusion and depreciation.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "540943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540943", "title": "Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education", "text": "Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education\n\nThe Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is a framework for classifying colleges and universities in the United States. The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions. The classification includes all accredited, degree-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).\n\nThe Carnegie Classification was created by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.\n\nOn October 8, 2014, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the Indiana University School of Education in Bloomington, Indiana. The classification retained the Carnegie name after the Center for Postsecondary Research took over on January 1, 2015.\n\nInformation used in these classifications comes primarily from IPEDS and the College Board.\n\nThe number of institutions in each category is indicated in parentheses.\n\n\"Doctorate-granting Universities\" are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in 2013–14. Professional doctorates (M.D., J.D., etc.) are not included in this count. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors. A detailed list of schools can be found in the List of research universities in the United States.\n\n\n\"Master's Colleges and Universities\" are institutions that \"awarded at least 50 master's degrees in 2013–14, but fewer than 20 doctorates.\"\n\n\n\"Baccalaureate Colleges\" are institutions where \"bachelor's degrees accounted for at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and they awarded fewer than 50 master's degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).\"\n\n\n\"Associates Colleges\" are institutions whose highest degree is the associate degree, or bachelor's degrees account for fewer than 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).\n\n\n\"Special Focus Institutions\" were classified \"based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the College Board's Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution's only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories\".\n\n\n\"Tribal Colleges\" are institutions that belong to the \"American Indian Higher Education Consortium.\"\n\n\nThe Basic Classification omits 26 institutions.\n\nThe \"Undergraduate Instructional Program\" classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).\n\nThe framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.\n\n\nThe framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.\n\n\nThe \"Graduate Instructional Program\" classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master's degrees or master's degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.\n\nInstitutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having \"Postbaccalaureate\" graduate programs. These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.\n\n\nInstitutions that offer doctoral degrees, including medical and veterinary degrees, are classified by the field in which they award degrees.\n\n\nThe Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.\n\n\nThe framework classifies institutions' \"Undergraduate Profile\" according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.\n\nThe framework classifies \"Enrollment Status\" according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).\n\n\"Selectivity\" is classified according to the SAT and ACT scores of first-time first-year students. This classification only applies to four-year or higher institutions. As of the 2010 edition the criteria were as follows (http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/methodology/ugrad_profile.php)\n\n\"Transfer origin\" characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.\n\n\"Size and Setting\" classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.\n\nThe \"size\" of institutions is based on their \"full-time equivalent (FTE)\" enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students. Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.\n\n\n\"Setting\" is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing. Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.\n\nIn contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme provides a \"...set of multiple, parallel classifications.\" According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, \"The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?\" In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme (\"Basic classification\") has been revised.\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions. The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on \"...how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education.\"\n\nThe Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their website has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.\n\nThe \"basic classification\" is an update of the original classification scheme. In addition to changing names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:\n\n\nPrior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of federal funding they received. The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions. Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor \"Research I\" is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6001461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6001461", "title": "Causes of transsexuality", "text": "Causes of transsexuality\n\nThe study of the causes of transsexuality investigates gender identity formation of transgender people, especially those who are transsexual. Transsexual people have a gender identity that does not match their assigned sex, often resulting in gender dysphoria.<section begin=\"factors\" /> The causes of transsexuality have been studied for decades. The most studied factors are biological. Certain brain structures in trans women have been found to be similar to cisgender women's as opposed to cis men's, and trans men's have been found to be similar to cis men's, even controlling for hormone use, which can also cause trans people's brains to become closer to those of cis people of the same gender. However, these studies are limited as they include a small number of tested individuals. Brain structure differences have also been noted between gay and heterosexual men, as well as lesbian and heterosexual women as part of extensive research on biology and sexual orientation. Studies have also found that both androphilic and gynephilic trans women's brain function and responses are like cis women's and unlike cis men's, or are intermediate between the two. Likewise, studies such as Rametti's have found that trans men have male-like white matter patterns (even before using hormones), regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nWith regard to genetic factors, a study by Hare reported that trans women have a longer androgen receptor gene than cis men, which is less effective at binding testosterone, potentially preventing complete masculinization of the brain (prenatal androgen exposure or sensitivity, or lack thereof, is an often cited mechanism to explain observed brain-structure differences). A study by Bentz found that trans men have a CYP17 allele distribution like cis men and unlike cis women. A twin study published in the \"International Journal of Transgenderism\" found that 33% of identical twin pairs were both trans, compared to only 2.6% of non-identical twins who were raised in the same family at the same time, but were not genetically identical.\n\nEnvironmental factors have also been proposed. The failure of an attempt to raise David Reimer from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving the theory that gender identity is determined by upbringing. Ray Blanchard developed a taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism that proposes two distinct etiologies for androphilic and gynephilic individuals that has become highly controversial, supported by J. Michael Bailey, Anne Lawrence, James Cantor, Richard F. Docter and others, but opposed by Charles Allen Moser, Larry Nuttbrock, Julia Serano, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.<section end=\"factors\" />\n\nA 2008 study compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cisgender male controls. Male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than cisgender males to have a longer version of a receptor gene (longer repetitions of the gene) for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone. The androgen receptor (NR3C4) is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male-to-female transsexuals. The authors say that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might prevent complete masculinization of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals and thereby cause a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.\n\nA variant genotype for a gene called CYP17, which acts on the sex hormones pregnenolone and progesterone, has been found to be linked to female-to-male transsexuality but not MtF transsexuality. Most notably, the FtM subjects not only had the variant genotype more frequently, but had an allele distribution equivalent to male controls, unlike the female controls. The paper concluded that the loss of a female-specific CYP17 T -34C allele distribution pattern is associated with FtM transsexuality.\n\nIn 2013, a twin study combined a survey of pairs of twins where one or both had undergone, or had plans and medical approval to undergo, gender transition, with a literature review of published reports of transgender twins. The study found that one third of identical twin pairs in the sample were both transgender: 13 of 39 (33%) monozygotic or identical pairs of assigned males and 8 of 35 (22.8%) pairs of assigned females. Among dizygotic or genetically non-identical twin pairs, there was only 1 of 38 (2.6%) pairs where both twins were trans. The significant percent of identical twin pairs in which both twins are trans and the virtual absence of dizygotic twins (raised in the same family at the same time) in which both were trans would provide evidence that transgender identity is significantly influenced by genetics if both sets were raised in different families.\n\nSeveral studies have found a correlation between gender identity and brain structure. A first-of-its-kind study by Zhou \"et al.\" (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region which is known for sex and anxiety responses (and which is affected by prenatal androgens), cadavers of six persons who were described as having been male-to-female transsexual or transgender persons in life had female-normal BSTc size, similar to the study's cadavers of cisgender women. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including cadavers of non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still had sizes typical for their gender. No relationship to sexual orientation was found.<ref name=\"Zhou/Gooren\"></ref>\n\nIn a follow-up study, Kruijver \"et al.\" (2000) looked at the number of neurons in BSTc instead of volumes. They found the same results as Zhou \"et al.\" (1995), but with even more dramatic differences. One MtF subject, who had never gone on hormones, was also included and matched up with the female neuron counts nonetheless.\n\nIn 2002, a follow-up study by Chung \"et al.\" found that significant sexual dimorphism (variation between sexes) in BSTc did not become established until adulthood. Chung \"et al.\" theorized that either changes in fetal hormone levels produce changes in BSTc synaptic density, neuronal activity, or neurochemical content which later lead to size and neuron count changes in BSTc, or that the size of BSTc is affected by the generation of a gender identity inconsistent with one's assigned sex.\n\nIn a review of the evidence in 2006, Gooren confirmed the earlier research as supporting the concept of transsexuality as a sexual differentiation disorder of the sex dimorphic brain. Dick Swaab (2004) concurs.\n\nIn 2008, a new region with properties similar to that of BSTc in regards to transsexuality was found by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab: the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou \"et al.\" (1995) and Kruijver \"et al.\" (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MtF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FtM transsexual within the male range.\n\nA 2009 MRI study by Luders et al. of 24 MtF transsexuals not yet treated with cross-sex hormones found that regional gray matter concentrations were more similar to those of cisgender men than to those of cisgender women, but there was a significantly larger volume of gray matter in the right putamen compared to cisgender men. Like earlier studies, it concluded that transsexuality was associated with a distinct cerebral pattern. (MRI allows easier study of larger brain structures, but independent nuclei are not visible due to lack of contrast between different neurological tissue types, hence other studies on e.g. BSTc were done by dissecting brains post-mortem.)\n\nAn additional feature was studied in a group of FtM transsexuals who had not yet received cross-sex hormones: fractional anisotropy values for white matter in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal tract. Rametti \"et al.\" (2010) discovered that, \"Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the corticospinal tract.\"\n\nHulshoff Pol \"et al.\" (2006) studied the gross brain volume of 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals undergoing hormone treatment. They found that hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner: treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls. They concluded: \"The findings suggest that, throughout life, gonadal hormones remain essential for maintaining aspects of sex-specific differences in the human brain.\"\n\nBrain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging or DTI. DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing white matter of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).\n\nSimilar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men, and between lesbian and heterosexual women. Studies have also found that circumstance and repeated activities such as meditation modify brain structures in a process called brain plasticity or neuroplasticity. In May 2014, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that parenting \"rewires the male brain\" for fathers.\n\nStudies have shown that androphilic male-to-female transsexuals show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 cisgender males and 12 cisgender females. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the cisgender men responded in several brain regions that the cisgender women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.\n\nIn another study, Rametti and colleagues used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 androphilic cisgender females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals were halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.\n\nWhile MRI taken on gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals have likewise shown differences in the brain from non-transsexuals, no feminization of the brain's structure have however been identified.\nResearchers of the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 cisgender male and 24 cisgender female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and cisgender males, and the cisgender females; but the gynephilic transsexuals \"displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced thalamus and putamen volumes and elevated GM volumes in the right insular and inferior frontal cortex and an area covering the right angular gyrus\".\n\nThese researchers concluded that:\nContrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group ... The present study does not support the dogma that [male-to-female transsexuals] have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).\n\nBerglund \"et al.\" (2008) tested the response of gynephilic MtF transsexuals to two sex pheromones: the progestin-like 4,16-androstadien-3-one (AND) and the estrogen-like 1,3,5(10),16-tetraen-3-ol (EST). Despite the difference in sexual orientation, the MtFs' hypothalamic networks activated in response to the AND pheromone, like the androphilic female control groups. Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response to EST. Gynephilic male control groups experienced hypothalamic activation in response to EST. However, the MtF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation to EST. The researchers concluded that in terms of pheromone activation, MtFs occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features. The MtF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment at the time of the study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.\n\nAnother team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to compare the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of 11 gynephilic FtM transsexuals with that of 9 androphilic cis females. Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of \"male shift\" could be made, the study did reveal that the gynephilic FtM transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right insula, two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.\n\nPhantom limb syndrome is a common, often painful experience after the loss of an external organ. Ramachandran (2008) found that while nearly two thirds of non-transsexual males who have a penis surgically removed experience the sensation of a phantom penis, only one third of MtF transsexuals do so after sex reassignment surgery. However, this study overlooks differences between an amputation, where nerves connecting the penis and brain are severed, and reassignment surgery, where some of the penis and scrotum may be reused to create a vaginal canal, labia and a clitoris. In this case, some nerves connecting the genitalia to the brain remain intact. Two thirds of FtM transsexuals reported the sensation of a phantom penis from childhood onwards, complete with phantom erections and other phenomena.\n\nPrenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male-to-female transsexuality. MtF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females.\n\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia in persons with XX sex chromosomes results in what is considered to be excess exposure to prenatal androgens, resulting in masculinization of the genitalia and, typically, controversial prenatal hormone treatment and postnatal surgical interventions. Individuals with CAH are usually raised as girls and tend to have similar cognitive abilities to the typical female, including spatial ability, verbal ability, language lateralization, handedness and aggression. Research has shown that people with CAH and XX chromosomes will be more likely to be same sex attracted, and at least 5.2% of these individuals develop serious gender dysphoria.\n\nIn males with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone is disrupted, decreasing the masculinization of genitalia. Individuals with this condition are typically raised as females due to their feminine appearance at a young age. However, more than half of males with this condition raised as females become males later in their life. Scientists speculate that the definition of masculine characteristics during puberty and the increased social status afforded to men are two possible motivations for a female-to-male transition.\n\nFor many years, people such as psychiatrist and sexologist David Oliver Cauldwell and Harry Benjamin argued that transsexuality was a psychological/emotional disorder caused by psychological and environmental factors and personality conflicts. The failure of an attempt to raise David Reimer from infancy through adolescence as a girl after his genitals were accidentally mutilated is cited as disproving this theory that gender identity is determined by parenting. However, no studies have been able to demonstrate this at a large scale, in part due to widespread agreement among scholars that the Reimer study's methodology was unethical. Reimer's case is used by organizations such as the Intersex Society of North America to caution against needlessly modifying the genitals of unconsenting minors.\n\nIn 2015, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a webinar series on gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender, etc. In the first lecture Dr. Sherer explains that parents' influence (through punishment and reward of behavior) can influence gender \"expression\" but not gender \"identity\". She cites a Smithsonian article that shows a photo of a 3 year old President Franklin D. Roosevelt with long hair, wearing a dress. Children as old as 6 wore gender neutral clothing, consisting of white dresses, until the 1940s. In 1927, \"Time\" magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors, which consisted of pink for boys and blue for girls. Dr. Sherer argued that kids will modify their gender expression to seek reward from their parents and society but this will not affect their gender identity (their internal sense of self).\n\nRay Blanchard has developed a taxonomy of male-to-female transsexualism built upon the work of his colleague Kurt Freund, which assumes that trans women have one of two motivations for transition. Blanchard theorizes that \"homosexual transsexuals\" transition because they are attracted to men, and characterizes them as displaying overt and obvious femininity since childhood; he then characterizes \"non-homosexual transsexuals\" as transitioning because they are autogynephilic (sexually aroused by the thought or image of themselves as a woman), and as being either attracted to women, attracted to both women and men, or asexual. By contrast, a 2009 study found that over 90% of cis women are also attracted to the thought of themselves as women. \n\nThe theory has gained support from J. Michael Bailey, Anne Lawrence, James Cantor, and others who argue that there are significant differences between the two groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. However, the theory has been criticized in papers from Veale, Nuttbrock, Moser, and others who argue that it is poorly representative of MtF transsexuals and non-instructive, and that the experiments behind it are poorly controlled and/or contradicted by other data. Many authorities, including some supporters of the theory, criticize Blanchard's choice of wording as confusing or degrading. Transsexuals themselves overwhelmingly reject the theory, with evolutionary biologist and trans woman Julia Serano writing that \"Blanchard's controversial theory is built upon a number of incorrect and unfounded assumptions, and there are many methodological flaws in the data he offers to support it.\" Blanchard's ideas about trans women have also been rejected by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the largest association of medical professionals who provides care for transgender people, as lacking empirical evidence. \n\nThe DSM-5 \"Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders\" workgroup, of which Blanchard is a member, has said:\n\nIn contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, & Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder & Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct. \n\nAutogynephilia, a propensity to be aroused by the thought of being a woman, has been proposed as an etiology of male-to-female transsexuality. Autogynephilia is common among late-onset transsexuals. A study on autogynephilic men found that they were more gender dysphoric than non-autogynephilic men. Another study using phallometry found that gynephilic male-to-female gender identity patients were autogynephilic even if they claimed to have never been aroused by crossdressing. Charles Moser, a physician, has expressed skepticism about the validity of phallometry, however.\n\n"}

{"id": "229072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229072", "title": "Criticism", "text": "Criticism\n\nCriticism is the practice of judging the merits and faults of something. \n\nCriticism is an evaluative or corrective exercise that can occur in any area of human life. Criticism can therefore take many different forms (see below). How people go about criticizing, can vary a great deal. In specific areas of human endeavour, the form of criticism can be highly specialized and technical; it often requires professional knowledge to appreciate the criticism. For subject-specific information, see the Varieties of criticism page.\n\nTo criticize does not necessarily imply \"to find fault\", but the word is often taken to mean the simple expression of an object against prejudice, no matter positive or negative. Often criticism involves active disagreement, but it may only mean \"taking sides\". Constructive criticism will often involve an exploration of the different sides of an issue. \n\nCriticism is often presented as something unpleasant, but there are friendly criticisms, amicably discussed, and some people find great pleasure in criticism (\"keeping people sharp\", \"providing the critical edge\"). The Pulitzer Prize for Criticism has been presented since 1970 to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated 'distinguished criticism'.\n\nWhen criticism involves a dialogue of some kind, direct or indirect, it is an intrinsically social activity. \n\nCriticism is also the study, evaluation, and interpretation of literature, artwork, film, and social trends (see the article links below). The goal is to understand the possible meanings of cultural phenomena, and the context in which they take shape. In so doing, it is often evaluated how cultural productions relate to other cultural productions, and what their place is within a particular genre, or a particular cultural tradition.\n\nThis section is about the origin and evolution of the meanings of the expression \"criticism\".\n\n\nThe early English meaning of criticism was primarily literary criticism, that of judging and interpreting literature. Samuel Johnson is often held as the prime example of criticism in the English language, and his contemporary Alexander Pope's \"Essay on Criticism\" is a significant landmark. In the course of the 17th century, it acquired the more general sense of censure, as well as the more specialized meaning of the \"discernment of taste\", i.e. the art of estimating the qualities and character of literary or artistic works, implicitly from the point of view of a consumer.\n\nTo be critical meant, positively, to have good, informed judgement about matters of culture (to be cultivated, to be a man or woman of distinction), but negatively it could also refer to the (unreasonable) rejection or (unfair) treatment of some outside group (\"to be critical of them\"). Derivatively, \"a criticism\" also referred to a nice point or a distinction, a tiny detail, a pedantic nicety, a subtlety, or a quibble (the sense of what today is called a \"minor criticism\"). Often criticism was governed by very strict cultural rules of politeness, propriety and decency, and there could be immediate penalties if the wrong words were said or written down (in 17th century England, more than half of men and about three-quarters of women could not read or write).\n\nIn the 19th century, criticism also gained the philosophical meaning of \"a critical examination of the faculty of knowledge\", particularly in the sense used by Immanuel Kant. (See Oxford English Dictionary). Such criticism was carried out mainly by academic authorities, businessmen and men of property with the leisure to devote themselves to the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nIn the 20th century, all these meanings continued, but criticism acquired the more general connotation of voicing an objection, or of appraising the pros and cons of something.\n\n\nFrom the 1970s onward, under the influence of neo-Marxism, critical theory and Michel Foucault, it became fashionable in the English-speaking academic social sciences and humanities to use the French word \"critique\", instead of the ordinary \"criticism\". The suggestion is that there is a \"difference\" between the two terms, but what exactly it is, is often not altogether clear. Often the connotation is that if a deliberation is a \"critique\" and not just a \"criticism\", then there is \"a lot of extra thought and profound meaning\" behind what is being said. A \"critique\" in the modern sense is normally understood as a \"systematic\" criticism, a critical essay, or the critical appraisal of a discourse (or parts of a discourse). Thus, many academic papers came to be titled or subtitled \"a critique\". From the 1970s, English-speaking academics and journalists also began to use the word \"critique\" not only as a noun, but as a verb (e.g. \"I have critiqued the idea\", instead of \"I have criticized the idea\"). What is often implied is, that \"critiqueing\" goes deeper into the issue, or is more complete, than \"criticizing\", possibly because the specialist criteria of a particular discipline are being applied.\n\n\nCriticism can be:\n\nDifferent kinds of criticisms can be distinguished as types using the following criteria:\n\nIn dealing with criticisms, usually the most important aspects are who makes the criticism, what the criticism is about, and what or whom it is aimed at. It can also make a big difference though whether a criticism is e.g. communicated in person, or whether it is communicated with a letter or telephone message.\n\nFor an overview of criticisms from particular political or philosophical perspectives, see Varieties of criticism. For subject-specific information, see the critical pages on art, film, literature, theatre, or architecture.\n\nIn general, the psychology of criticism studies the cognitive and emotional effects of criticism, the behavioral characteristics of criticism, and its influence on how people are reacting.\n\nThe psychology of criticism is primarily concerned with: \n\nParents, teachers, lawyers, managers and politicians are often concerned with these issues, because it can make a great deal of difference to how problems are tackled and resolved.\n\nThe motivation as well as the effect of criticism may be rational, or it may be non-rational or arbitrary; it may be healthy or unhealthy.\n\nWhen psychologists study criticism as a type of human behavior, they do not usually study it \"in general\" – such a general study is often considered to be more a \"philosophical\" concern. Psychologists usually study it in specific contexts and situations. The reason is partly technical (it is difficult to construct and prove universal generalizations about criticism as a human behavior) and partly practical (it is more useful to understand particular behaviors which are of direct practical concern).\n\nThe most basic \"rule-of-thumb\" of criticism which psychologists usually recommend is:\n\nThe thought behind this basic norm for criticism is: \n\nThe critics may just want to provoke or vent a bit of hostility, but it might backfire, because the people criticized may make a nasty response. The nasty response may \"prove\" to the critics, that the criticism was justified, but the critics have brought this on themselves, they have produced their own nastiness. It is easy to do, but may be difficult to live with. In the process, the whole point of the criticism may be lost – all that happens is, that there is a quarrel between people who just vent their hostility. This is very unlikely to produce any solution that all concerned can live with.\n\nThe basic psychological rule of criticism assumes that people want to use criticism to achieve an improvement, usually \"in good faith\" (bona fide). It assumes the critic has a positive intention in making the criticism. The rule may not make much sense if there is an all-out war going on, where the opposition is just trying to destroy and discredit the target as much as possible, using almost any means they can find. Nevertheless, psychologists recommend to respond by attacking what the opponents actually \"do\", not \"who they are\". That way, the critic cannot be accused of unfair or prejudiced treatment of others.\n\nThe basic rule is not always easy to apply.\n\n\nConsequently, psychologists often recommend that before a criticism is being stated to a person, the critic should try to get into rapport with the person being criticized (\"get in sync\" with the other person, \"on the same wavelength\"). If that is not possible (because they are enemies), the best thing may be not to express the criticism at all, or get a mediator. It may take considerable strategy in order to find a way of making a criticism, so that it \"really hits home\". Rather than \"shooting their mouth off\", it may be wise if people say nothing, until the right time and place arrives to make the criticism.\n\nOne problem at the \"receiving\" end is that a criticism may be taken more seriously than it really merits, or that it is taken \"too personally\", even though that was not the intention of the critic. Criticisms are often voiced without knowing exactly what the response will be. It may be that this problem cannot be entirely removed; the best one can do is to judge, on the basis of experience, what would be the most likely effect of the criticism, and communicate the criticism as well as one can.\n\nAnother sort of problem is the limited attention span of individuals. To express a criticism may require detailed explanation or clarification; it presupposes that the knowledge exists to understand what it is about, and that people are willing to listen. That takes time, and the time may not be available, or people are reluctant to take the time. This can get in the way of the mutual respect required. It may be possible to overcome this problem only by formulating the criticism as briefly as possible, and communicate it in a form which takes the least time to understand it. Failing that, people must \"make time\" to discuss the criticism. It can take considerable effort to create the situation in which the criticism will be \"heard\".\n\nThe exception to the basic psychological rule consists of cases where, it is argued, the individuals and their behaviors \"cannot be distinguished\". This would be the case, for example, if the criticism itself consisted of \"being there\" (intruding, trespassing, causing property damage), or \"not being there\" (non-response).\n\nIn some cases people deliberately seek \"loopholes\" in the ordinary rules and channels for criticism, in order to make a criticism which, although strictly not illegal, may have a malicious intention, or offends the target of the criticism. That can cause the ordinary consideration which people have for others to be abandoned. What is legitimate and illegitimate criticism is not always easy to establish, and there may be \"grey areas\" in the law. It is rarely possible to make rules for every detail of what people may or may not do. The law itself can also be contested with criticism, if it is perceived as unfair. Nevertheless, the courts usually draw the line somewhere.\n\nThe ability to criticize is something which rarely occurs naturally; it must be learnt. Good critics exhibit several kinds of qualities:\n\nThese qualities are learned through practical experience in which people have a dialogue or debate and give each other feedback. Often, teachers can design assignments specifically to stimulate students to acquire these qualities. But the facility for critical thought usually requires some personal initiative. There are plenty of \"lazy critics\", but one must work hard to be a good critic. The lazy critic is soon forgotten, but a good critic is remembered for years.\n\nWith criticism it is always important to keep things in proportion, neither overdoing things, nor being too timid.\n\n\nAn important reason why balanced criticism is desirable is, that if things get totally out of proportion, the critics or their targets can lose their balance themselves. Criticism can wreak havoc, and therefore people have to know how to handle it from both ends. If the criticism is balanced, it is more likely to be successful, or, at any rate, it has more credibility.\n\nWhen psychologists analyze the effect of criticism on others, they are concerned with how people respond to criticism (cognitively and emotionally), and how criticism influences the recipient's behavior.\n\nWhen people criticize, it can have a fruitful, enriching and constructive effect on the recipient, because new ideas and viewpoints may be generated in trying to solve a problem.\n\nPeople can also be hurt by criticisms, when they experience the criticism as a personal attack. Psychologists concerned with human communication, such as therapists, therefore often recommend that people should choose the right words to express their criticism. The same criticism can be raised in different ways, some more successful than others.\n\nIf people formulate their criticism in the right way, it is more likely that other people will accept it. If the criticism is badly expressed, people might reject it, not because it is wrong in itself, but because they do not like being talked to in that way. Even if the content of a criticism is quite valid, the form in which it is expressed may be so counter-productive, that the criticism is not accepted. The \"content\" may be something that people can work out on their own, but the \"form\" concerns the social relationship between people.\n\nThe term \"feedback\" is often used instead of criticism, because \"feedback\" may sound more neutral, while criticism may seem to be about \"finding fault\". A more polite language may be used when there are issues of authority and obedience (\"who has to follow whom\"), as well as the need for cooperative teamwork to get a job done (\"constructive collegial attitude\"). The question is often \"who controls the feedback\", \"who is allowed to criticize\", \"who owns the problem\" and \"who is to do something about the problem\". It may be that managers educate employees to employ a more positive and professional language, in order to get them to see things in a way that is more productive for the enterprise.\n\nEspecially educators, but also e.g. lawyers, managers and politicians are very concerned with the \"quality\" of criticisms. People might raise all kinds of objections and criticisms, but how good are they? Criticisms can be just \"noise\". They can also be a nuisance if they are misdirected, they get in the way of getting things done.\n\nIdeally, a criticism should be:\n\nNot all criticisms have all these features, but if one or more of them is missing, the criticism is less likely to achieve its goal. Almost all guidelines for criticism mention these seven points, although in particular contexts their meaning may be more exactly specified (for example, what it means to be \"articulate and persuasive\" can vary according to the circumstances).\nLogically, there are just as many ways to get a criticism wrong as to get the criticism right. \n\nThe main effect of lousy criticism is usually that, rather than clarifying things, it becomes disorienting or confusing to people. Therefore, lousy criticism is usually regarded as unhelpful, or as an unwanted distraction getting in the way of things. The only thing a lousy criticism achieves is to make it clear that somebody has an objection (although the objection is not well-taken).\n\nTechniques of constructive criticism aim to improve the behavior or the behavioral results of a person, while consciously avoiding personal attacks and blaming. This kind of criticism is carefully framed in language acceptable to the target person, often acknowledging that the critics themselves could be wrong. Insulting language and hostile language are avoided, and phrases are used like \"I feel...\" and \"It's my understanding that...\" and so on. Constructive critics try to stand in the shoes of the person criticized, and consider what things would look like from their perspective.\n\nSome people are not open to any criticism at all, even constructive criticism. Also, there is an art to truly constructive criticism: being well-intentioned is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for constructively criticizing, since one can have good intentions but poor delivery (\"I don't know why my girlfriend keeps getting mad when I tell her to stop with the fries already; I'm just concerned about her weight\"), or egocentric intentions but appropriate delivery (\"I'm sick of my subordinate coming in late for work, so I took her aside and we had a long, compassionate talk about her work-life balance. I think she bought it.\"). As the name suggests, the consistent and central notion is that the criticism must have the aim of constructing, scaffolding, or improving a situation, something which is generally obstructed by hostile language or personal attacks.\n\nPeople can sometimes be afraid to express a criticism, or afraid to be criticized. Criticism can \"press all the wrong buttons.\" The threat of criticism can be sufficient to silence people, or cause them to stay away. So self-confidence can play a big role in criticism – the confidence to criticize, and the confidence to face criticism. If people's emotions are not properly considered, criticism can fail to succeed, even although it is well-intentioned, or perfectly sensible. Hence criticism is often considered an \"art\", because it involves human insight into \"what one can say and cannot say\" in the given situation.\n\nOne style of constructive criticism employs the \"hamburger method\", in which each potentially harsh criticism (the \"meat\") is surrounded by compliments (the \"buns\"). The idea is to help the person being criticized feel more comfortable, and assure the person that the critic's perspective is not entirely negative. This is a specific application of the more general principle that criticism should be focused on maintaining healthy relationships, and be mindful of the positive as well as the negative.\n\nThe psychopathology of criticism refers to the study of unhealthy forms of criticism, and of unhealthy kinds of response to criticism. Psychologists often associate these with particular categories of mental disorders, especially personality disorders, as classified in the U.S. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (this manual is also used in other countries, although the forms of personality disorders can be somewhat different in different countries, reflecting ethnic differences and differences in social systems).\n\nTo understand pathological criticism and pathological responses to criticism, it is often not sufficient to see the individuals concerned in isolation – they should be placed in the total context in which the criticism or the response to it occurs. Particular situations can \"bring out\" the \"bad side\" of people, which in the normal run of events would not occur. Pathological criticism occurs especially in situations of intense conflict or competition, where the normal internal and external controls on people's behaviour begin to break down. Not just personal change but also a \"change of scene\" may be required to get rid of the disorder.\n\nA term describing pathologic criticism may be used as argumentum ad hominem without proven diagnosis (see also \"anti-psychiatry movement\").\n\nThe anti-psychiatry movement opposes labeling persons who engage in criticism as having a \"disease\" (or \"abuse\" or \"addiction\"). \n\nConfronted with unhealthy criticism or unhealthy responses to criticism, it may be unwise to get scared, and it may be unnecessary to run to the doctor straightaway. It may be sufficient to talk it out, even if it is not the most pleasant discussion. If people are simply labelled \"ill\", they get away with behaviour that, arguably, they ought to be taking responsibility for, themselves. It should not be too easily assumed that people are incapable of making conscious choices about their own behaviour, unless they are deranged (crazy), in great pain, extraordinarily confused, heavily intoxicated, or in some way trapped or locked down.\n\nCriticism can cause harm as well as good things. Criticism can hurt or people can feel offended. It can “upset the apple cart”, cause chaos, or do real damage. For these reasons, people often try to keep the flow of criticism under control with rules. Such rules often state:\nThese rules can be successful if people accept them, and work with them. But it can also happen that a criticism can only be made “against the rules.” In that case, a conflict can develop between the critics and the people in charge, where the authorities try to enforce the rules, and the critics try to make their criticism regardless. The conflict could be ended in many different ways; but usually it is difficult to suppress a valid criticism altogether, permanently. A lot of critical activity may consist simply of a battle to get one’s ideas taken seriously.\n\nHere the purpose of criticism and its relative merits in particular situations are discussed.\n\nCriticism may not be a positive response to an individual, action, or belief in all circumstances. There are two reasons that this might be the case:\n\n\nHowever, there are also significant reasons why a critique may be necessary or desirable in particular situations.\n\n"}
{"id": "18280830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18280830", "title": "Dark triad", "text": "Dark triad\n\nThe dark triad in psychology refers to the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy, which are called \"dark\" because of their malevolent qualities.\n\nResearch on the dark triad is used in applied psychology, especially within the fields of law enforcement, clinical psychology, and business management. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress and create severe problems for an organization, especially if they are in leadership positions (for more information, see psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism in the workplace).\n\nAll three dark triad traits are conceptually distinct although empirical evidence shows them to be overlapping. They are associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.\n\n\nA factor analysis carried out at the Glasgow Caledonian University found that among the big five personality traits, low agreeableness is the strongest correlate of the dark triad, while neuroticism and a lack of conscientiousness were associated with some of the dark triad members.\n\nIn 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto provoked a controversy by claiming that narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples. Delroy L. Paulhus and McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent American Psychological Association (APA) conference, inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature. Paulhus and Williams found enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct constructs; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.\n\nThe long-debated \"nature versus nurture\" issue has been applied to the dark triad. Research has begun to investigate the origins of the dark triad traits. In a similar manner to research on the Big Five personality traits, empirical studies have been conducted in an effort to understand the relative contributions of biology (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) in the development of dark triad traits.\n\nOne of the ways in which researchers attempt to dissect the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on personality (and individual differences more generally) is a broad investigative technique loosely grouped under the heading of \"twin studies\". For example, in one approach to twin studies,\n\nAll three traits of the dark triad have been\nfound to have substantial genetic components. It has also been found that the observed relationships among the dark triad, and among the dark triad and the Big Five, are strongly driven by individual differences in genes. However, while psychopathy (h = 0.64) and narcissism (h = 0.59) both have a relatively large heritable component, Machiavellianism (h = 0.31) has been found to be less heritable.\n\nCompared to biological factors, the influence of environmental factors seem to be more subtle and account for less—yet still significant—variation in individual differences as related to the development of dark triad traits. The influence of non-shared or unique environmental factors (definition and mathematical derivation included above at the end of the \"Origins\" subsection) accounts for a significant amount of the variance in all 3 dark triad traits (narcissism = 0.41, Machiavellianism = 0.30, psychopathy = 0.32), whereas only Machiavellianism (r = 0.39) has been found to be significantly related to a shared environmental factor. Although it requires substantiation, some researchers have interpreted this latter finding (along with the comparatively lower heritability noted in the section above) to mean that Machiavellianism is the most likely dark triad trait to be influenced by experience. At the very least, this notion about the modifiability of Machiavellianism does make some sense insofar as that the less variance there is attributable to genetic factors, the more variance there must be attributable to other factors, and \"other\" factors have traditionally been synopsized as environmental or experiential in nature.\n\nEvolutionary theory may also explain the development of dark triad traits. It has been argued that evolutionary behavior predicts not only the development of dark triad personalities, but also the flourishing of such personalities. Indeed, it has been found that individuals demonstrating dark triad personality can be highly successful in society. However, this success is typically short-lived. The main evolutionary argument behind the dark triad traits emphasizes mating strategies. This argument focuses on the notion of life history strategy. Life history strategy proposes that individuals differ in reproductive strategies; an emphasis on mating is termed a \"fast life\" strategy, while an emphasis on parenting is termed a \"slow reproductive\" strategy. There is some evidence that the dark triad traits are related to fast life history strategies; however, there have been some mixed results, and not all three dark triad traits have been related to this strategy. A more detailed approach has attempted to account for some of these mixed results by analyzing the traits at a finer level of detail. These researchers found that while some components of the dark triad are related to a fast life strategy, other components are related to slow reproductive strategies.\n\nIn general, clinicians treat these traits as pathological, something that needs to be treated, and inherently undesirable, e.g. socially condemned or personally counter-productive. However, others argue that adaptive qualities may accompany the maladaptive ones. The evolutionary perspective (above) considers the dark triad to represent different mating strategies. Their frequency in the gene pool requires at least some local adaptation.\n\nThe everyday versions of these traits appear in student and community samples, where even high levels can be observed among individuals who manage to get along in daily life. Even in these samples, research indicates correlations with aggression, racism, and bullying among other forms of social aversiveness.\n\nNarcissism was discussed in the writings of Sigmund Freud, and psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis was addressed in the early writings of Hervey Cleckley in 1941 with the publication of \"The Mask of Sanity\". Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, complemented by self-report assessments that are appropriate for the general population, these traits can now be studied at the subclinical level. In the general population, the prevalence rates for sub-clinical and clinical psychopathy are estimated at around 1% and 0.2%, respectively. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be any reliable estimates of either clinical or sub-clinical narcissism in the general population.\n\nWith respect to empirical research, psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1970s with the pioneering efforts of Robert Hare, his Psychopathy Checklist (PCL), and its revision (PCL-R). Hare notes in his book, \"Without Conscience\" that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data. However, recent efforts have been made to study psychopathy in the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary Psychopathy Scales, The Psychopathic Personality Inventory, and the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale.\n\nSimilarly, assessment of narcissism required clinical interviews, until the popular \"Narcissistic Personality Inventory\" was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979. Since the NPI, several other measures have emerged which attempt to provide self-report alternatives for personality disorder assessment. In addition, new instruments have been developed to study \"pathological\" narcissism as opposed to \"grandiose\" narcissism, which is what many argue the NPI measures.\n\nMachiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM) for psychological disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct. The original published version of the Mach-IV is still the most widely used in empirical research.\n\nAs noted previously, there is a good deal of conceptual and empirical overlap between the dark triad traits. For example, researchers have noted that all three traits share characteristics such as a lack of empathy, interpersonal hostility, and interpersonal offensiveness. Likely due in part to this overlap, a number of measures have recently been developed that attempt to measure all three dark triad traits simultaneously, such as the Dirty Dozen and the short dark triad (SD3).\nAt their root, however, most of these measures are questionnaire-style and require either self-response or observer-response (e.g., ratings from supervisors or coworkers). Both methods can prove problematic when attempting to measure any socially aversive trait as self-responders may be motivated to deceive. A more specific confound might also exist for dark triad traits and Machiavellianism in particular: individuals who are skilled at deceiving and manipulating others should be perceived as low in deceptiveness and manipulation by others, and are therefore likely to receive inaccurate ratings.\nDespite these criticisms and the acknowledged commonalities among the dark triad traits, there is evidence that the constructs are related yet distinct.\n\nNamed after the philosophy espoused by Niccolò Machiavelli in \"The Prince\", people who score high on this trait are cynical (in an amoral self-interest sense, not in a doubtful or skeptical sense), unprincipled, believe in interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly. Scores on measures of Machiavellianism correlate negatively with agreeableness (r= -.47) and conscientiousness (r=-.34). Machiavellianism is also significantly correlated with psychopathy.\n\nIndividuals who score high on narcissism display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority. Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with extraversion (r = .42) and openness (r = .38) and negatively with agreeableness (r = -.36). Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation with psychopathy.\n\nConsidered the most malevolent of the dark triad, individuals who score high on psychopathy show low levels of empathy combined with high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking. The similarity between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder have been noted by some researchers. Psychopathy has been found to correlate with all of the Big Five personality factors: extraversion (r = .34), agreeableness (r = -.25), conscientiousness (r = -.24), neuroticism (r = -.34) and openness (r = .24).\n\nThe most pronounced group difference is in gender: numerous studies have shown that men tend to score higher than women on narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy, although the magnitude of the difference varies across traits and the measurement instruments used. One interesting finding related to narcissism—albeit one based on non-representative samples—is that while men continue to score higher than women, it seems that the gender gap has shrunk considerably when comparing cohort data from 1992 and 2006. More specifically, the aforementioned findings indicate that there has been a general increase in levels of narcissism over time among college students of both sexes, but comparatively, the average level of narcissism in women has increased more than the average level of narcissism in men.\nThere is far less information available on race differences in dark triad traits, and the data that is available is not representative of the population at-large. For instance, a 2008 research study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians reported higher levels of narcissism relative to Asians. Similarly, another 2008 study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians tended to score slightly higher than non-Caucasians on Machiavellianism. When attempting to discern whether there are ethnic differences in psychopathy, researchers have addressed the issue using different measurement instruments (e.g., the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and The Psychopathic Personality Inventory), but no race differences have been found regardless of the measure used. Additionally, when comparing Caucasians and African Americans from correctional, substance abuse, and psychiatric samples—groups with typically high prevalence rates of psychopathy—researchers again failed to find any meaningful group differences in psychopathy. However, in a research conducted by Richard Lynn, a substantial racial difference in psychopathy was found. Lynn proposes \"that there are racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality conceptualised as a continuously distributed trait, such that high values of the trait are present in blacks and Native Americans, intermediate values in Hispanics, lower values in whites and the lowest values in East Asians.\"\n\nThe focal variable when analyzing generational or cohort differences in dark triad traits has tended to be narcissism, arising from the hypothesis that so-called “Generation Me” or “Generation Entitlement” would exhibit higher levels of narcissism than previous generations. Indeed, based on analyses of responses to the Narcissistic Personality Inventory collected from over 16,000 U.S. undergraduate students between 1979 and 2006, it was concluded that average levels of narcissism had increased over time. Similar results were obtained in a follow-up study that analyzed the changes within each college campus. Trzesniewski & Donnellan (2010) present conflicting evidence and argue that there have not been large changes in disposition or behavioral strategies across generations, although they do note that the current generation is less trusting and more cynical, which are both changes that might be indicative of an increase in Machiavellianism.\n\nOliver James identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits as typically being prevalent in the workplace (see also Machiavellianism in the workplace, narcissism in the workplace and psychopathy in the workplace). Furnham (2010) has identified that the dark triad is related to the acquisition of leadership positions and interpersonal influence. In a meta-analysis of dark triad and workplace outcomes, Jonason and colleagues (2012) found that each of the dark triad traits were related to manipulation in the workplace, but each via unique mechanisms. Specifically, Machiavellianism was related with the use of excessive charm in manipulation, narcissism was related with the use of physical appearance, and psychopathy was related with physical threats. Jonason and colleagues also found that the dark triad traits fully mediated the relationship between gender and workplace manipulation. The dark triad traits have also been found to be fairly well-represented in upper-level management and CEOs.\n\nRecent studies have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. The 2013 case study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 survey indicated that trolling is an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism. Both studies suggest that this trolling may be linked to bullying in both adolescents and adults.\n\nStudies have suggested that on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an accelerated mating strategy, reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex, lowered standards in their short-term mates, a tendency to steal or poach mates from others, more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse, a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger amounts of money, limited self-control and greater incidence of ADHD symptoms and a pragmatic and game-playing romance style. These traits have been identified as part of a fast life strategy that appears to be enacted by an exploitative, opportunistic, and protean approach to life in general and at work.\n\nThe evidence is mixed regarding the exact link between the dark triad and reproductive success. For example, there is a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy. Additionally, these traits are not universally short-term-oriented nor are they all impulsive. Furthermore, much of the research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that assume the dark triad are a single construct, in spite of genetic and meta-analytic evidence to the contrary.\n\nSee also: r/K selection theory (connection remains controversial).\n\nSeveral academic studies have found evidence that people with dark triad personalities are judged as slightly better-looking than average on first sight. Two studies have determined that this is because people with dark triad traits put more effort into their appearance, and the difference in attractiveness disappears when \"dressed down\" with bland clothing and without make up. Two more studies found that only narcissistic subjects were judged to be better-looking, but the other dark triad traits of machiavellianism and psychopathy had no correlation with looks.\n\nThe five factor model of personality has significant relationships with the dark triad combined and with each of the dark triad’s traits. The dark triad overall is negatively related to both agreeableness and conscientiousness. More specifically, Machiavellianism captures a suspicious versus trusting view of human nature which is also captured by the Trust sub-scale on the agreeableness trait. Extroversion captures similar aspects of assertiveness, dominance, and self-importance as narcissism. Narcissism also is positively related to the achievement striving and competence aspects of Conscientiousness. Psychopathy has the strongest correlations with low dutifulness and deliberation aspects of Conscientiousness.\n\nThe honesty-humility factor from the HEXACO model of personality is used to measure sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty. Honesty-Humility has been found to be strongly, negatively correlated to the dark triad traits. Likewise, all three dark triad traits are strongly negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility. The conceptual overlap of the three traits which represents a tendency to manipulate and exploit others for personal gain defines the negative pole of the honesty-humility factor. Typically, any positive effects from the DT and low H-H occur at the individual level, that is, any benefits are conferred onto the beholder of the traits (e.g., successful mating, obtainment of leadership positions) and not onto others or society at large. A study found that individuals who score low in Honesty-Humility have higher levels of self-reported creativity.\n\nSeveral researchers have suggested expanding the dark triad to contain a fourth dark trait. Everyday sadism, defined as the enjoyment of cruelty, is the most common addition. While sadism is highly correlated with the dark triad, researchers have shown that sadism predicts anti-social behavior beyond the dark triad. Borderline personality disorder and status-driven risk-taking have also been proposed as additions.\n\nThe vulnerable dark triad (VDT) comprises three related and similar constructs: vulnerable narcissism, factor 2 psychopathy, and borderline personality disorder. A study found that these three constructs are significantly related to one another and manifest similar nomological networks. Although the VDT members are related to negative emotionality and antagonistic interpersonal styles, they are also related to introversion and disinhibition. The study does note however that its findings are based largely on the self-reports of parents of White undergrad students rather than information gleaned from clinical evaluation.\n\nWithin the clinical/pathological realm, narcissism can manifest itself in a particularly severe form known as malignant narcissism. Malignant narcissism presents not only with signs and symptoms of grandiose narcissism, but also includes features of paranoia, sadism, aggression, and psychopathy (particularly antisocial behaviors).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21920776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21920776", "title": "Folk religion", "text": "Folk religion\n\nIn religious studies and folkloristics, folk religion, popular religion, or vernacular religion comprises various forms and expressions of religion that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of organized religion. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed popular belief, it consists of ethnic or regional religious customs under the umbrella of a religion, but outside official doctrine and practices.\n\nThe term \"folk religion\" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects. The first is the religious dimension of folk culture, or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of syncretisms between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and Roman Catholicism that led to the development of Vodun and Santería, and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.\n\nChinese folk religion, folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the clergy of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious worship, do not belong to a church or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of faith in a particular creed, to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children baptised.\n\nIn \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\", John Bowker characterized \"folk religion\" as either \"religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems\" or \"the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level.\"\n\nDon Yoder argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion. The first was a perspective rooted in a cultural evolutionary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute \"the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development\". This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism. The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.\n\nYoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was \"the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies\", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as superstition. The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the \"folk interpretation and expression of religion\". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in witchcraft, he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of \"folk religiosity\", thereby defining folk religion as \"the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion\". His fifth and final definition represented a \"practical working definition\" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as \"the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion\".\n\nYoder described \"folk religion\" as existing \"in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion\".\n\nAlternately, the sociologist of religion Matthias Zic Varul defined \"folk religion\" as \"the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence\".\n\nIn Europe the study of \"folk religion\" emerged from the study of \"religiöse Volkskund\", a German term which was used in reference to \"the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion\". This term was first employed by a German Lutheran preacher, Paul Drews, in a 1901 article that he published which was titled \"Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie\". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to. Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of folkloristics. During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of \"religiöse Volkskund\" had been produced by the folklorists Josef Weigert, Werner Boette, and Max Rumpf, all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities. Over the coming decades, Georg Schreiber established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in Munich while a similar department was established in Salzburg by Hanns Koren. Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were Heinrich Schauert and Rudolf Kriss, the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's Bayerisches Nationalmuseum. Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as pilgrimage and the use of shrines.\n\nIn the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among cultural anthropologists studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America. The pioneer in this field was Redfield, whose 1930 book \"Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village\" contrasted and examined the relationship between \"folk religion\" and \"official religion\" in a peasant community. Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term \"folk religion\" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German \"Volksreligion\". One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of Joshua Trachtenberg's 1939 work \"Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion\". The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of comparative religion, appearing in the titles of Ichiro Hori's \"Folk Religion in Japan\", Martin Nilsson's \"Greek Folk Religion\", and Charles Leslie's reader, the \"Anthropology of Folk Religion\". Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as John Messenger's at Indiana University and Don Yoder's at the University of Pennsylvania.\nAlthough the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of theology and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity. He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.\n\nThe term \"folk religion\" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.\n\nYoder noted that one problem with the use of the term \"folk religion\" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term \"religion\" in reference solely to organized religion. He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion Émile Durkheim, who insisted that \"religion\" was organized in order to contrast it with \"magic\". Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term \"folk belief\" over \"folk religion\".\n\nA second problem with the use of \"folk religion\" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the sociology of religion, used the term as a synonym for ethnic religion (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a \"universal religion\" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries. Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.\n\nThe folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of \"folk religion\", as well as related terms like \"popular religion\" and \"unofficial religion\", by scholars, does \"an extreme disservice\" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because – in his opinion – such terms are \"residualistic, [and] derogatory\". He argued that using such terminology implies that there is \"a pure element\" to religion \"which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities\". As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use \"vernacular religion\" as an alternative. Defining this term, Primiano stated that \"vernacular religion\" is, \"by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular\".\n\nKapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it \"mistaken\" and arguing that switching from \"folk religion\" to \"vernacular religion\" results in the scholar \"picking up a different selection of things from the world\". He cautioned that both terms were \"ideological and semantic load[ed]\" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.\n\nChinese folk religion or Shenism are labels used to describe the collection of ethnic religious traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in China and among Han Chinese ethnic groups up to the present day. Shenism describes Chinese mythology and includes the worship of \"shen\" (spirit, god, awareness, consciousness) which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city gods, national deities, culture heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. \"Shenism\" as a term was first published by AJA Elliot in 1955.\n\nChinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a branch of Shenism, since it sprang out of folk religion and Chinese philosophy. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.\n\nDespite being heavily suppressed during the last two centuries, from the Taiping Rebellion to the Cultural Revolution, it is currently experiencing a modern revival in both Mainland China and Taiwan. Various forms have received support by the Government of the People's Republic of China, such as Mazuism in Southern China (officially about 160 million Chinese are Mazuists), Huangdi worship, Black Dragon worship in Shaanxi, and Cai Shen worship.\n\nFolk Christianity is defined differently by various scholars. Definitions include \"the Christianity practiced by a conquered people\", Christianity as most people live it – a term used to \"overcome the division of beliefs into Orthodox and unorthodox\", Christianity as impacted by superstition as practiced by certain geographical Christian groups, and Christianity defined \"in cultural terms without reference to the theologies and histories.\"\n\nFolk Islam is an umbrella term used to collectively describe forms of Islam that incorporate native folk beliefs and practices. Folk Islam has been described as the Islam of the \"urban poor, country people, and tribes\", in contrast to orthodox or \"High\" Islam (Gellner, 1992) Sufism and Sufi concepts are often integrated into Folk Islam.\n\nVarious practices and beliefs have been identified with the concept of \"folk Islam\". They include the following:\n\nIn one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled \"Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion\", Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion. This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.\n\nLater studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in \"hibbut ha-qever\" (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical aggadah and was then further developed by the kabbalists.\nRaphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion. In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element, which he sees in the goddess Asherah, the Shekhinah, the Matronit, and Lilith.\nWriter Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the apotropaic, or thaumaturgical, i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune. He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and halakah, magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life. He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the ba'al shem of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century. These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and herbal medicine to bring harm to enemies, and success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.\n\nCharles Liebman has written that the essence of the folk religion of American Jews is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the Passover seder, social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration. Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, \"The Ambivalent American Jew\" (1973) and \"American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation\".\n\nIn sociology, folk religion is often contrasted with elite religion. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error. A similar concept is lived religion, the study of religion as practiced by believers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "409255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=409255", "title": "Green manure", "text": "Green manure\n\nIn agriculture, green manure is created by leaving uprooted or sown crop parts to wither on a field so that they serve as a mulch and soil amendment. The plants used for green manure are often cover crops grown primarily for this purpose. Typically, they are ploughed under and incorporated into the soil while green or shortly after flowering. Green manure is commonly associated with organic farming and can play an important role in sustainable annual cropping systems.\n\nGreen manures usually perform multiple functions that include soil improvement and soil protection:\n\n\n\nIncorporation of green manures into a farming system can drastically reduce the need for additional products such as supplemental fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nLimitations to consider in the use of green manure are time, energy, and resources (monetary and natural) required to successfully grow and utilize these cover crops. Consequently, it is important to choose green manure crops based on the growing region and annual precipitation amounts to ensure efficient growth and use of the cover crop(s).\n\nGreen manure is broken down into plant nutrient components by heterotrophic bacteria that consumes organic matter. Warmth and moisture contribute to this process, similar to creating compost fertilizer. The plant matter releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and weak acids that react with insoluble soil minerals to release beneficial nutrients. Soils that are high in calcium minerals, for example, can be given green manure to generate a higher phosphate content in the soil, which in turn acts as a fertilizer.\n\nThe ratio of carbon to nitrogen in a plant is a crucial factor to consider, since it will impact the nutrient content of the soil and may starve a crop of nitrogen, if the incorrect plants are used to make green manure. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen will differ from species to species, and depending upon the age of the plant. The ratio is referred to as C:N. The value of N is always one, whereas the value of carbon or carbohydrates is expressed in a value of about 10 up to 90; the ratio must be less than 30:1 to prevent the manure bacteria from depleting existing nitrogen in the soil. Rhizobium are soil organisms that interact with green manure to retain atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. Legumes, such as beans, alfalfa, clover and lupines, have root systems rich in rhizobium, often making them the preferred source of green manure material.\n\nLate-summer and fall green manure crops are oats and rye.\n\nOther green manure crops:\n\nThe value of green manure was recognized by farmers in India for thousands of years, as mentioned in treatises like Vrikshayurveda. In Ancient Greece too, farmers ploughed broad bean plants into the soil. Chinese agricultural texts dating back hundreds of years refer to the importance of grasses and weeds in providing nutrients for farm soil. It was also known to early North American colonists arriving from Europe. Common colonial green manure crops were rye, buckwheat and oats. Traditionally, the incorporation of green manure into the soil is known as the fallow cycle of crop rotation, which was used to allow the soil to regain its fertility after the harvest.\n\n"}

In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.\n\nIn developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or government-owned mass media.

While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence \"alternative\". As such, advocacy journalism tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term \"alternative\" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term \"independent\" over \"alternative\". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.\n\nIn many developing countries, the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the economy, health, and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of self-censorship, soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.\n\nSelf-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by film producers, film directors, publishers, news anchors, journalists, musicians, and other kinds of authors. In authoritarian countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In pluralistic capitalist countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the market. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger advertisers or the publication's parent company in order to protect their livelihood.\n\nSoft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government. This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.\n\nMany organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its professional capacity. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; media literacy training; digital media training and integration; infrastructure development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.\n\nSome development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. \"Media development\" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. \"Media for development\" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many ICT for Development (ICT4D) projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.\n\nWhile development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are Internews, International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), and International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX). In addition, organizations like the Center for International Media Assistance, Reporters Without Borders, Article 19, and others monitor media development efforts and freedom of the press around the world.\n"}

The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from scientific visualization: \"it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given\".\n\nThe field of information visualization has emerged \"from research in human-computer interaction, computer science, graphics, visual design, psychology, and business methods. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research, digital libraries, data mining, financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing production control, and drug discovery\".\n\nInformation visualization presumes that \"visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways.\"\n\nData analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.), statistics (hypothesis test, regression, PCA, etc.), data mining (association mining, etc.), and machine learning methods (clustering, classification, decision trees, etc.). Among these approaches, information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.\n\nThe modern study of visualization started with computer graphics, which \"has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in \"Scientific Computing\". Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM SIGGRAPH\". They have been devoted to the general topics of data visualisation, information visualization and scientific visualisation, and more specific areas such as volume visualization.\n\nIn 1786, William Playfair published the first presentation graphics.\n\n\nInformation visualization insights are being applied in areas such as:\n\nNotable academic and industry laboratories in the field are:\n\nConferences in this field, ranked by significance in data visualization research, are:\n\nFor further examples, see: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1441691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1441691", "title": "Interactive movie", "text": "Interactive movie\n\nAn interactive movie, also known as a movie game, is a video game that presents its gameplay in a cinematic, scripted manner, often through the use of full-motion video of either animated or live-action footage. In modern times, the term also refers to games that have a larger emphasis on story/presentation than on gameplay, often used in a pejorative way.\n\nThis genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs and laserdisc players, the first nonlinear or random access video play devices. The fact that a laserdisc player could jump to and play any chapter instantaneously (rather than proceed in a linear path from start to finish like videotape) meant that games with branching plotlines could be constructed from out-of-order video chapters in much the same way as \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books could be constructed from out-of-order pages, or the way an interactive film is constructed by choosing from a web of linked narratives.\n\nThus, interactive movies were animated or filmed with real actors like movies (or in some later cases, rendered with 3D models), and followed a main storyline. Alternative scenes were filmed to be triggered after wrong (or alternate allowable) actions of the player (such as 'Game Over' scenes).\n\nA popular example of a commercial interactive movie was the 1983 arcade game \"Dragon's Lair\", featuring a full motion video (FMV) cartoon by ex-Disney animator Don Bluth, where the player controlled some of the moves of the main character. When in danger, the player was to decide which move or action, or combination to choose. If they chose the wrong move, they would see a 'lose a life' scene, until they found the correct one which would allow them to see the rest of the story. There was only one possible successful storyline in \"Dragon's Lair\"; the only activity the user had was to choose or guess the move the designers intended them to make. Despite the lack of interactivity, \"Dragon's Lair\" was very popular.\n\nThe hardware for these games consisted of a laserdisc player linked to a processor configured with interface software that assigned a jump-to-chapter function to each of the controller buttons at each decision point. Much as a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book might say \"If you turn left, go to page 7. If you turn right, go to page 8\", the controller for \"Dragon's Lair\" or \"Cliff Hanger\" would be programmed to go to the next chapter in the successful story if a player pressed the right button, or to go to the death chapter if he pressed the wrong one. Because laserdisc players of the day were not robust enough to handle the constant wear placed on them by constant arcade use, they required frequent replacement. The laserdiscs that contained the footage were ordinary laserdiscs with nothing special about them save for the order of their chapters, and if removed from the arcade console would readily display their video on standard, non-interactive laserdisc players.\n\nLater advances in technology allowed interactive movies to overlay multiple fields of FMV, called \"vites\", in much the same way as polygonal models and sprites are overlaid on top of backgrounds in traditional video game graphics.\n\nThe first example of interactive cinema was \"Kinoautomat\" (1967), which was written and directed by Radúz Činčera. This movie was first screened at Expo '67 in Montreal. This film was produced before the invention of the laserdisc or similar technology, so a live moderator appeared on stage at certain points to ask the audience to choose between two scenes. The chosen scene would play following an audience vote.\n\nThe first interactive movie game was Nintendo's \"Wild Gunman\", a 1974 electro-mechanical arcade game that used film reel projection to display live-action full-motion video (FMV) footage of Wild West gunslingers. In the 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) released a hit electro-mechanical arcade game with live-action FMV, projecting car footage filmed by Toei.\n\nAn early attempt to combine random access video with computer games was \"Rollercoaster\", written in BASIC for the Apple II by David Lubar for David H. Ahl, editor of \"Creative Computing\". This was a text adventure that could trigger a laserdisc player to play portions of the feature film \"Rollercoaster\" (1977). The program was conceived and written in 1981, and published in the January 1982 issue of \"Creative Computing\", along with an article by Lubar detailing its creation, an article by Ahl claiming that \"Rollercoaster\" is the first video/computer game hybrid and proposing a theory of video/computer interactivity, and other articles reviewing hardware necessary to run the game and do further experiments.\n\nThe first arcade laserdisc video game was Sega's \"Astron Belt\", an early third-person space combat rail shooter featuring live-action full-motion video footage (largely borrowed from a Japanese science fiction film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed. Developed in 1982, it was unveiled at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago and released the following year. However, the game that popularized the genre in the United States was \"Dragon's Lair\", animated by Don Bluth and released by Cinematronics shortly after. Around the same time, the laserdisc games \"Bega's Battle\" and \"Cliff Hanger\" were also released.\n\nSeveral laserdisc games added their own innovations to the genre. \"Bega's Battle\", released by Data East in 1983, introduced \"branching paths\", in which there were multiple \"correct moves\" at certain points in the animation, and the move the player chose would affect the order of later scenes. \"Space Ace\", another Don Bluth animated game released by Cinematronics the following year, also featured a similar branching formula. In 1984, \"Super Don Quix-ote\", \"Esh's Aurunmilla\" and \"Ninja Hayate\" overlaid crude computer graphics on top of the animation to indicate the correct input to the player, which the 1985 games \"Time Gal\" and \"Road Blaster\" also featured.\n\nBecause \"Dragon's Lair\" and \"Space Ace\" were immensely popular, they spawned a deluge of sequels and similar laserdisc games, despite the astronomical cost of the animation. To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from anime that were obscure to American audiences of the day. One such early example was Stern's \"Cliff Hanger\", a 1983 game released around the same time which used footage from the \"Lupin III\" movies \"Castle of Cagliostro\" (directed by Hayao Miyazaki) and \"Mystery of Mamo\". Another example released around that time was \"Bega's Battle\", which used footage from \"Harmagedon\", though it used a different approach, introducing a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling. \"Bega's Battle\" also featured a branching storyline. \"Time Gal\" (1985) added a time-stopping feature, where specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time; during these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.\n\nIn 1987, the game \"Night Trap\", featuring full-motion video, was created for Hasbro's Control-Vision video game system (originally codenamed \"NEMO\"), which used VHS tapes. When Hasbro discontinued production of Control-Vision, the footage was placed into archive until it was purchased in 1991 by the founders of Digital Pictures. Digital Pictures ported Night Trap to the Sega CD platform, releasing it in 1992.\n\nIn 1988, Epyx announced three VCR games including one based on its video game \"California Games\". They combined videotape footage with a board game. In the late 1980s, American Laser Games started to produce a wide variety of live-action light gun laserdisc video games, which played much like the early cartoon games, but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action. Meanwhile, Digital Pictures started to produce a variety of interactive movies for home consoles. When CD-ROMs were embedded in home computers, games with live action and full motion video featuring actors were considered cutting-edge, and some interactive movies were made. Some notable adventure games from this era are \"Under a Killing Moon\", \"The Pandora Directive\", \"\", \"Voyeur\", \"\", \"\", \"Ripper\", \"Snatcher\", \"Black Dahlia\", \"The X-Files Game\", \"Phantasmagoria\", \"Bad Day on the Midway\" and \"The Dark Eye\". Others in the action genre are \"Brain Dead 13\" and \"\".\n\nDue to the limitation of memory and disk space, as well as the lengthy timeframes and high costs required for the production, not many variations and alternative scenes for possible player moves were filmed, so the games tended not to allow much freedom and variety of gameplay. Thus, interactive movie games were not usually very replayable after being completed once.\n\nFrom the time of its original introduction, the DVD format specification has included the ability to use an ordinary DVD player to play interactive games, such as \"Dragon's Lair\" (which was reissued on DVD), the \"Scene It?\" and other series of DVD games, or games that are included as bonus material on movie DVDs. Aftermath Media (founded by Rob Landeros of Trilobyte) released the interactive movies \"Tender Loving Care\" and \"Point of View\" (P.O.V) for the DVD platform. Such games have appeared on DVDs aimed at younger target audiences, such as the special features discs of the \"Harry Potter\" film series.\n\nLater video games used this approach using fully animated computer generated scenes, including various adventure games such as the \"Sound Novel\" series by Chunsoft, \"Shenmue\" series by Sega, \"Shadow of Memories\" by Konami, \"Time Travelers\" by Level 5, and \"Fahrenheit\" by Quantic Dream. During many scenes, the player has limited control of the character and chooses certain actions to progress the story. Other scenes are quick time event action sequences, requiring the player to hit appropriate buttons at the right time to succeed. Some of these games, such as the \"Sound Novel\" series, \"Shadow of Memories\", \"Time Travelers\", \"Heavy Rain\", \"\" and \"\", have numerous branching storylines that result from what actions the player takes or fails to complete properly, which can include the death of major characters or failure to solve the mystery. This idea was even further realized in Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\" series, where player actions can drastically change future games, for example, different characters may be alive in the end depending on choices made by the player in The Walking Dead season 1, but those same characters affect \"\".\n\nCast members' work during the 1990s on interactive movies' chroma key sets was different from traditional filmmaking: They performed multiple possible actions players choose in a game, usually looked into the camera to react to the player, and usually did not react to others on the set. Such products were popular during the early 1990s as CD-ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way into the living rooms, providing an alternative to the low-capacity cartridges of most consoles. As the first CD-based consoles capable of displaying smooth and textured 3D graphics appeared, the full-FMV game had vanished from the mainstream circles around 1995, although it remained an option for PC adventure games for a couple more years. One of the last titles released was the 1998 PC and PlayStation adventure \"\", packed in 7 CDs. That same year, \"\" became the first game developed specifically for DVD-ROM, and one of the last \"interactive movies\" to make heavy use of live-action FMV. In 2014, the Tex Murphy series continued with a new FMV game, \"\".\n\nA LaserDisc video game is a video game that uses pre-recorded video (either live-action or animation) played from a LaserDisc, either as the entirety of the graphics, or as part of the graphics. The first arcade laserdisc game was Sega's \"Astron Belt\", an early third-person space combat rail shooter featuring live-action full-motion video footage (largely borrowed from a Japanese science fiction film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed. Developed in 1982, the game's unveiling at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago marked the beginning of LaserDisc fever in the videogame industry, and its release in Japan the following year marked the first commercial release of a LaserDisc game. However, its release in the United States was delayed due to several hardware and software bugs, by which time \"Dragon's Lair\" had beaten it to public release there.\n\nThe first LaserDisc game to gain popularity in the United States was \"Dragon's Lair\" in 1983. It contained animated scenes, much like a cartoon. The scenes would be played back and at certain points during playback the player would have to press a specific direction on the joystick or the button to advance the game to the next scene, like a quick time event. For instance, a scene begins with the hero falling through a hole in a drawbridge and being attacked by tentacles. If the player presses the button at this point, the hero fends off the tentacles with his sword, and pulls himself back up out of the hole. If the player fails to press the sword button at the right time, or instead presses a direction on the joystick, the hero is attacked by the tentacles and crushed. Each move of the joystick, however, would produce a few moments of black screen, when the graphics switched between either a successful outcome or the death of the character, which interrupted the continuous flow of gameplay found in other videogame graphic systems of the time; this was a common criticism of some players and critics.\n\nDespite the high cost of the animation, a deluge of similar LaserDisc video games followed \"Dragon's Lair\" because of its immense popularity. To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from several Japanese anime movies that were obscure in America at the time, creating games like \"Cliff Hanger\" (from Hayao Miyazaki's \"Castle of Cagliostro\" and from \"Mystery of Mamo\") and \"Bega's Battle\" (from \"Harmagedon\"), both of which were released roughly around the same time as \"Dragon's Lair\". Later arcade LaserDisc games include \"Freedom Fighter\", \"Badlands\", \"Space Ace\", and \"Road Blaster\".\n\nOther LaserDisc video games followed the lead of \"Astron Belt\" by integrating more and more computer graphics with the pre-recorded video. For example, Funai's \"Inter Stellar\" in 1983 was a forward-scrolling third-person rail shooter that used computer graphics for the ships and full-motion video for the backgrounds. Similarly, \"M.A.C.H. 3\" and \"Cube Quest\" were vertical scrolling shooters that used the LaserDisc video for the background and computer graphics for the ships. The \"Firefox\" arcade game included a Philips LaserDisc player to combine live action video and sound from the \"Firefox\" film with computer generated graphics and sound. The game used a special CAV LaserDisc containing multiple storylines stored in very short, interleaved segments on the disc. The player would seek the short distance to the next segment of a storyline during the vertical retrace interval by adjusting the tracking mirror, allowing perfectly continuous video even as the player switched storylines under control of the game's computer. This method of seeking was noted for being extremely strenuous on the player and frequently led to the machines breaking, slightly hindering the appeal of LaserDisc arcade games. In the 1990s, American Laser Games produced a wide variety of live-action light gun LaserDisc video games, which played much like the early LaserDisc games, but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action.\n\n\"Bega's Battle\", released by Data East in 1983, took a different approach and introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cut scenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling. \"Bega's Battle\" also featured a branching storyline.\n\nA DVD game (sometimes called DVDi, \"DVD interactive\") is a standalone game that can be played on a set-top DVD player. The game takes advantage of technology built into the DVD format to create an interactive gaming environment compatible with most DVD players without requiring additional hardware. DVD TV games were first developed in the late 1990s. They were poorly received and understood as an entertainment medium. However, DVD-based game consoles like the PlayStation 2 popularized DVD-based gaming, and also functioned as a DVD video player. In addition, the format has been used to import some video games to the DVD format, allowing them to be played with a standard DVD player rather than requiring a PC. Examples include \"Dragon's Lair\" and \"Who Shot Johnny Rock?\". The PC/console game \"\" was released in 2006 as a DVD game entitled \"\".\nJapanese games such as visual novels and eroge that were originally made for PC are commonly ported to DVDPG (a term that stands for \"DVD Players Game\"). Instead of standard save methods, DVDPGs use password save systems. Similar game types include BDPG (Blu-ray Disc Players Game) and UMDPG (Universal Media Disc Players Game).\n\nThe world's first live interactive movie was \"My One Demand\" filmed and premiered on 25 June 2015 Created by Blast Theory, the film was streamed live to the TIFF Lightbox on three successive nights. The cast of eight included Julian Richings and Clare Coulter. Audiences in the cinema used mobile phones to answer questions from the narrator, played by Maggie Huculak and their answers were included in the voiceover as well as in the closing credits.\n\nAlthough interactive movies had a filmic quality that sprite-based games could not duplicate at the time, they were a niche market— the limited amount of direct interactivity put off many gamers. The popularity of FMV games declined during 1995, as real-time 3D graphics gained increasing attention. The negative response to FMV-based games was so common that it was even acknowledged in game marketing; a print advertisement for the interactive movie \"Psychic Detective\" stated, \"Yeah, we know full-motion video games in the past sucked.\"\n\nCost was also an issue, as live action video with decent production values is expensive to film, while video shot on a low budget damages the overall image of the game. \"\" cost Sega around US$3 million, about the same as a low-budget movie would cost in 1994.\n\nThough not as crucial an issue as the limited interactivity, another issue that drew criticism was the quality of the video itself. While the video was often relatively smooth, it was not actually full-motion as it was not of 24 frames per second or higher. In addition to this, the hardware it was displayed on, particularly in the case of the Sega CD, had a limited color palette (of which a maximum of 64 colors were displayable simultaneously), resulting in notably inferior image quality due to the requirement of dithering. Game designer Chris Crawford disparages the concept of interactive movies, except those aimed at elementary-school-age children, in his book \"Chris Crawford on Game Design\". He writes that since the player must process what is known and explore the options, choosing a path at a branch-point is every bit as demanding as making a decision in a conventional game, but with much less reward since the result can only be one of a small number of branches.\n\nDefenders of the genre have argued that, by allowing the player to interact with real people rather than animated characters, interactive full-motion video can produce emotional and visceral reactions that are not possible with either movies or traditional video games.\n\nSome studios hybridized ordinary computer game play with interactive movie play; the earliest examples of this were the entries in the Origin Systems \"Wing Commander\" series starting with \"Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger\". Between combat missions, \"Wing Commander III\" featured cut-scenes with live actors; the game offered limited storyline branching based on whether missions were won or lost and on choices made at decision points during the cut-scenes.\n\nOther games like \"BioForge\" would, perhaps erroneously, use the term for a game that has rich action and plot of cinematic proportions—but, in terms of gameplay, has no relation to FMV movies.\n\nThe term is an ambiguous one since many video games follow a storyline similar to the way movies would.\n\n\n"}

It promotes the study and utilization of nonmilitary strategies by civilian-based movements to establish and defend human rights, social justice and democracy.\n\nBased in Washington, DC, ICNC works with educational institutions and nongovernmental organizations in the United States and around the world to educate the global public and to influence policies and media coverage of the growing phenomenon of strategic nonviolent action.\n\nThe ICNC was founded by Peter Ackerman and Jack DuVall in 2002. Jack DuVall serves as ICNC’s president and Founding Director, while Peter Ackerman serves as ICNC's Founding Chair. A writer, former military intelligence officer, and former public television executive, Jack DuVall was the executive producer of a television series, \"A Force More Powerful\", on the television station PBS and is co-author of the companion book of the same name (Palgrave/St. Martin’s Press 2001), both of which explore major 20th century nonviolent action campaigns. Peter Ackerman, a venture capitalist who was a highly-paid associate of Michael Milken at Drexel Burham Lambert in the 1980s specializing in leveraged buyouts received his PhD. from Tufts University’s Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy, and has written a series of scholarly books on strategic nonviolent action, has served on the board of Freedom House (including as chair between 2005-2009) and is a member of Council on Foreign Relations.[1] In raising public awareness of the history and ideas of nonviolent conflict in both democratic and autocratic societies, ICNC has disseminated books, articles, broadcast media, video programming, computer games and other learning materials. Staff members and associated scholars have led seminars in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East for journalists, activists, educators and NGO leaders on the history and dynamics of strategic nonviolent action.\n\nICNC involvement in seminars and workshops involving activists in human rights, pro-democracy and social justice campaigns overseas have led to charges from some governments of foreign intervention, though ICNC policy prohibits its presenters from giving specific advice regarding any particular struggle. Such workshops, according to ICNC policy, come only in response to specific requests from activist groups themselves and are not initiated by ICNC. ICNC also maintains a strictly apolitical posture, in that it works with groups challenging autocratic governments regardless of a given regime's ideological orientation or relations with the United States.\n\nHowever, ICNC allegedly maintains connections with the \"US-based 'democracy promoting' establishment groups of USAID and Reagan's National Endowment for Democracy as well as links to the CIA.\"\n\nICNC has cooperated with other independent non-profit groups concerned with strategic nonviolent action, including the Albert Einstein Institution, Nonviolence International, and the Serbian-based Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). ICNC is funded exclusively through a private family endowment and maintains a strict policy of not accepting funding from nor collaborating with any government or government-funded entities.\n\nHardy Merriman who is president of the ICNC worked for the Albert Einstein Institution from 2002-2005. Peter Ackerman funded the Albert Einstein Institution from its founding in 1983 until 2002\n\nICNC has been criticized for involvement in US-backed regime change operations. For example, American-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger alleged that during 2005 and 2006, the ICNC trained Venezuelan youths to try to reverse the government of Hugo Chávez, through \"[impeding] the electoral process and [creating] a scenario of fraud,\" claiming that the ICNC did this together with USAID and NED as part of a systemic plan of implementing United States foreign policy aims in democratic countries. ICNC denies it ever engaged in such trainings, which are a violation of its charter. Jack Duvall has claimed that the only time ICNC was ever involved in Venezuela was in 2006 when it supported the travel of two nonviolent activists to the World Social Forum in Caracas, at which they met with Chavez supporters to discuss methods of resisting any possible coup attempt.\n\nIn response to criticisms made by Michael Barker, Stephen Zunes, who acts as the chair of the ICNC's advisory board wrote that the...\n\n"}

One type of interpretive bias is hostile attribution bias, wherein individuals perceive benign or ambiguous behaviors as hostile. For example, a situation in which one friend walks past another without acknowledgement. The individual may interpret this behavior to mean that their friend is angry with them.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that individuals with anxiety are more likely to experience interpretive bias. One study considered the interpretation of neutral facial expressions in individuals with high and low social anxiety and found that socially anxious participants perceived neutral faces as negative regardless of the context. In contrast, the study found that non-anxious participants only showed interpretive bias in situations that created anxiety, rather than as a function of their personality.\n\nAnother studied considered how anxiety influenced which meaning of homographs was chosen. Homographs are words with at least two meanings. They found that anxious personalities are more likely to produce threatening interpretations. Another study found that interpretive bias depends on subsequent controlled processes.\n\n"}
{"id": "445940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445940", "title": "Iṣṭa-devatā (Hinduism)", "text": "Iṣṭa-devatā (Hinduism)\n\nIshta-Deva or Ishta Devata (Sanskrit: ईष्ट देवता, \"\", literally \"cherished divinity\" from \"iṣṭa\"\n\"desired, liked, cherished, preferred\" and \"devatā\" \"godhead, divinity, tutelary deity\" or \"deva\" \"deity\") is a term denoting a worshipper's favourite deity within Hinduism.\n\nIt is especially significant to both the Smarta and Bhakti schools wherein practitioners choose to worship the form of God that inspires them. Within Smartism, one of five chief deities are selected. Even in denominations that focus on a singular concept of God, such as Vaishnavism, the Ishta Deva concept exists. For example, in Vaishnavism, special focus is given to a particular form of Lord Vishnu or one of his Avatars (i.e. Krishna or Rama), and similarly within Shaktism, focus is given to a particular form of the Goddess such as Parvati or Lakshmi. The Swaminarayan sect of Vaishnavism has a similar concept, but notably holds that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God.\n\nThe \"worship of the five forms\" () system, which was popularized by philosopher among orthodox Brahmins of the Smārta tradition, invokes the five deities Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva, Devī, and Sūrya. This system was instituted by primarily to unite the principal deities of the five major sects () on an equal status. The monistic philosophy preached by made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading Brahman.\n\nTypically a practitioner worships their Ishta-Deva through the form of a murti. This worship may involve offering items to their chosen divinity such as incense or flowers, reciting mantras, singing their names and offering prayers.\n\nRemembering the deity and internally building a relationship with (or through) them is considered essential to the practise. Within the Advaita schools it is believed that the human mind needs a concrete form to understand the divine that ultimately can never be defined. Just as one can understand the abstract concept of a color only after one has seen a concrete form, one can only realize the deity through a form of murti. In contrast, the Dvaita schools believe the Supreme Being to possess a divine form, and offer worship to their Ishta-Deva as either a representation or direct expansion of the Supreme Person. For example, Vaishnava schools offer worship exclusively to murtis of Vishnu, or his associated avatars such as Krishna or Rama.\n\nShaivites worship Shiva, either figuratively, or through his Lingam murti. As Shaivism contains both monistic and dualistic traditions either (or both) of the above approaches may be applicable.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5879951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5879951", "title": "Legislative violence", "text": "Legislative violence\n\nLegislative violence broadly refers to any violent clashes between members of a legislature, often physically, inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.\n\nAlthough the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to stress and anger. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions. \nGalusha A. Grow, no stranger to legislative violence, described the precursors thusly:\n\nNazifa Zaki and Hamida Ahmadzai fought over rocket attacks into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nTax bill sparks brawls in the parliament of Algeria.\n\nRoman general and dictator Julius Caesar was famously assassinated by a group of senators on the Ides of March, 44 BC during a meeting of the Roman Senate. The senators, led by Cassius and Brutus and calling themselves Liberatores, had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the Theatre of Pompey, they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their togas, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a civil war for control of the republic, ending ultimately with the rise of Caesar Augustus and the founding of the Roman Empire.\n\nLegislative violence has happened in Armenia.\n\nIn 2007 a fight broke out in the lower chamber of the national legislature of Bolivia, the Chamber of Deputies. The fight erupted during a debate over whether or not to try four judges on corruption charges.\n\nNDP House Leader Nathan Cullen attempted to delay the passing of a Conservative budget bill, leading to a threatening confrontation between Conservative Government House Leader Peter van Loan and NDP leader Tom Mulcair, described in the media as a \"near-brawl\".\n\nBefore a vote in the House of Commons Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \"manhandled\" Conservative Party Opposition Whip Gord Brown and inadvertently elbowed NDP MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau. The incident went on to be known as \"Elbowgate\".\n\nCzech Health Minister David Rath and his right-wing rival, Miroslav Macek, fought during a meeting of disgruntled dentists in Prague.\n\n\nDuring a session of the Riigikogu, the Farmers' Assemblies accused Minister of Education and Welfare Leopold Johanson of Socialist Workers' Party of accepting bribes. Artur Tupits of the Farmers' Assemblies then slapped Johanson in the face twice, until the two were separated. Disturbances continued on the next day. Tupits was then arrested for two months. His name inspired a new expression for a brawl in Estonian (\"tupitsat tegema\", similar to the earlier expression \"tuupi tegema\").\n\nIn 1988 when Pope John Paul II addressed the European Parliament, Ian Paisley, then an MEP, denounced him as the Antichrist and was subjected to booing by fellow MEPs who also threw objects at him; Otto von Habsburg was among those who helped physically eject him from the room.\n\nMike Hookem punched Steven Woolfe in the face at a party meeting in 2016.\n\nA brawl broke out when an argument over the composition of Georgian delegations in international institutions turned violent.\n\nA fight erupted between rival MPs in the Greek Parliament.\n\nTwo lawmakers who entered the parliament's chamber without being authorized to do so caused a scuffle then the lawmakers tried to read out their oath of office.\n\nIn January 1988, there was a riot in the Tamil Nadu state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for Janaki Ramachandran, who was serving as Chief Minister following the death in December 1987 of her husband MGR. The ADMK party had split, with most MLAs supporting her and some supporting Jayalalithaa's bid to become Chief Minister instead. The Congress party with its 60 MLAs was able to play \"kingmaker\". While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons. The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under President's rule for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.\n\nOn 25 March 1989, a riot broke out in the state legislative assembly in Tamil Nadu between members of the ruling DMK party and the now-unified opposition ADMK party over the reading of the state budget. In the melee, Durai Murugan tried to disrobe Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi had his sunglasses broken, and the budget was torn up by angry rioters.\n\nRiots broke out in the state legislative assembly in Uttar Pradesh with MLAs using microphones, chairs as weapons.\n\nA member of the legislative assembly has been assaulted on 10 November 2009 in the state assembly. One of the members 'who can't speak Marathi' took the oath in Hindi, one of the official languages of India. This was objected to by a right wing party Maharashtra Navanirmana Samithi, that wants Marathi to be the official language in the state. Four members of the Maharashtra Navaniramana Samithi were immediately suspended for 4 years.\n\nThere has been violence in the Council of Representatives of Iraq.\n\nKurdish MPs brawled in the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament over president term.\n\nLegislative violence has happened in Israel.\n\nA brawl broke out in 2010 over an issue of funding for new youth social centres.\n\nA brawl broke out in Japan's parliament on 17 September after the upper house approved legislation for the controversial security bills that would allow the country to send troops to fight abroad for the first time since the Second World War.

It was the latest installment of the string of fistfights that rattled the Mexican legislature. The incident was broadcast on live television. In spite of such events the ceremony took place. Calderón entered the Congress chamber through a back door directly onto the podium, and in a quick ceremony took the Oath of Office amid jeers. Then, after singing the national anthem which silenced the opposition for a while, he took a quick exit rather than deliver his inaugural address to Congress (the traditional follow-up to the oath taking).\n\nThere was a violent incident in the Parliament of Morocco.\n\nA brawl broke out in Nepal's parliament over Nepal's constitution\n\nA fight broke out in the National Assembly of Nigeria after a group of members were suspended for accusing the speaker of corruption.\nNigerian politicians were involved in a fight after a group from the People's Democratic Party (PDP) tried to address parliament.\n\nPakistani politicians fought over the Asia Bibi blasphemy case.\n\nThe Congress of the Republic of Peru has been in many violence acts through the years.\n\nWhen Peru had a bicameral legislature, member of congress Rómulo León (APRA) tried to grab and punch his colleague Fernando Olivera (FIM) because Olivera was accusing him of having secret bank accounts in a Swiss bank. He was suspended 120 days from Congress.\n\nAfter Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress and approved a unicameral legislature, Congressman Javier Diez Canseco decided to finish a heated discussion with a Fujimorist congressman with a punch in the jaw. He was suspended 120 days from the legislature for the violent act.\n\nOn the oath day, Congressmen threw coins to their colleague Roger Cáceres because they were accusing him of being a turncoat for moving to the government party Peru 2000. His son Roger Cáceres Pérez (also a Congressman) insulted the coin throwers.\n\nCongresswomen Nancy Obregón and Elsa Malpartida did not approve the Free Trade Agreement with the United States. For that reason, they tried to escape punching and kicking the Congress security. They were suspended 120 days from the legislature for the violent acts.\n\nCongressman Víctor Andrés García Belaúnde accused his colleague Luis Wilson of having members of his family working for a national hospital with high salaries. Luis Wilson started to defy García Belaúnde's accusations, then he went to his desk and started insulting and tried to fight with him, but his colleagues prevented it.\n\nIn the Philippines, Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a former military officer who led 2 infamous coup attempts (Oakwood Mutiny and Manila Peninsula siege) during the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo presidential administration, seen on national television as he turned off the microphone of his fellow Senator (former Partymate) Alan Peter Cayetano during the Senate hearing on the Philippine war on drugs in September 2016, and in January 2017 to Sen. Migz Zubiri in near fistfighting, after the Kilusang Pagbabago Coalition Members rejected the Trillanes resolution for investigation for the Bureau of Immigration Bribery scandal.\n\nMembers of the Economic Freedom Fighters party became engaged in a brawl with security guards after attempting to prevent President Jacob Zuma from addressing the parliament.\n\nThere have been several events of legislative violence in South Korea. However, the politicians who were involved in the violence often don't receive criminal penalties under the civil laws.\n\nDuring a vote to approve Kim Jong-pil as Prime Minister, Grand National Party legislators submitted blank ballots to demonstrate their disapproval. A fight broke out after supporters of the ruling coalition of Kim Dae-jung demanded that the vote be declared void.\n\nDuring a National Assembly vote on the motion to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun, supporters of the President openly clashed with opposition MPs for 20 minutes in an effort to stop the vote (which was in favor of impeachment) from being finalized.\n\nA brawl broke out as The National Assembly passed three bills that is set to reform the media industry. Opposition MPs blocked the Speaker from entering the room to pass the bills while both sides clashed. The bills were eventually passed by the Deputy Speaker.\n\nA brawl broke out as the Grand National Party forcefully passed the year 2011 budget bill in advance without the presence of the opposition parties.\n\nA brawl broke out as The National Assembly ratified the country's Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States. The Opposition lawmakers used tear gas in the parliament. The ruling Grand National Party (GNP) managed to force it through without the kind of brawl that many were expecting.\n\nOn 23 February 1981. Lieutenant-Colonel Antonio Tejero led 200 armed Civil Guard officers into the Congress of Deputies during the vote to elect a Prime Minister. The officers held the parliamentarians and ministers hostage for 18 hours, during which time King Juan Carlos I denounced the coup in a televised address, calling for rule of law and the democratic government to continue. Though shots were fired, the hostage-takers surrendered the next morning without killing anyone. \n\nLegislative violence has happened in the Parliament of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe then-chairman of the National Assembly Paul Somohardjo (PL) and representatives Ronnie Brunswijk (ABOP) and Rashid Doekhie (NDP) were involved in a fistfight on the assembly floor, after the latter accused Somohardjo of involvement with alleged corruption at the ministry of Spatial Planning.\n\nThe Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is probably the most notable modern example of legislative violence. In the history of the Legislative Yuan, numerous violent acts have occurred during parliamentary sessions. It is popularly referred to locally as \"Legislator Brawling\" (). In 1995, the Legislative Yuan was presented with the Ig Nobel Prize Peace Award, for \"demonstrating that politicians gain more by punching, kicking and gouging each other than by waging war against other nations.\" Listed below are the most current brawlings in the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan.\n\nA serious scuffle broke out between the ruling and opposition party members after an argument over vote recounts from the presidential election.\n\nLegislators and William Lai got into a brawl over legislative procedures. TV stations showed Zhu grabbing Lai and trying to wrestle him onto a desk. He then tried to headbutt his colleague before jabbing him in the stomach. The brawl resulted in having a traffic policeman called into the chamber to test Zhu's alcohol level, after he was accused of being drunk. The tests showed no sign of alcohol influence.\n\nDuring a debate on a military hardware purchase ordinance, the opposition and ruling party engaged in a food fight after a disagreement broke out.\n\nAmid a proposal about creating direct transport links with People's Republic of China, DPP deputy Wang Shu-hui snatched the written proposal and shoved it into her mouth. Opposition members failed to get her to cough it up by pulling her hair. She later spat the proposal out and tore it up. This was the third time that the DPP’s actions had stopped a vote over the issue.\n\nDuring the incident another DPP member, Zhuang Hezi, spat at an opposition member.\n\nTwo dozen members overwhelmed the Speaker's podium, which became a free-for-all between the ruling (DPP) and opposition (KMT) parties with punches and sprayed water, requiring at least one hospitalization. The fight was over an alleged delay of the annual budget.\n\nAngry Taiwan legislators wrestled, splashed water and bit one another in a brawl over a controversial capital gains tax on share trading.\n\nLegislators in parliament brawled on two consecutive days over a controversial $420 billion infrastructure spending plan, which the opposition (headed by the KMT) claims to benefit cities and counties faithful to the current President's ruling party, the DPP. They also claim that the plan has been devised to secure support for the party ahead of next year's regional elections.\n\nOn 13 July 2017, the Premier of the Republic of China, Lin Chuan was prevented from delivering his report on the budget after a water balloon was thrown towards him. This resulted in him leaving the chamber and causing the session to come to a halt. In the following day, opposition lawmakers occupied the chamber and raised large padded office chairs above their heads, surrounded the podium and tussled with rival legislators to prevent Mr Lin from presenting the report once more as water balloons were thrown. This resulted in the early suspension of the parliamentary session.\n\nThere has been legislative violence in the National Assembly of Thailand.\n\nThere has been legislative violence during TBMM sessions, including:\n\nLawmakers of Parliament of Uganda were brawling during a plenary session after the parliament speaker allowed the constitutional amendment to be presented to MPs. The amendment about the age-limit issue on re-election of President Yoweri Museveni who is 73 years old and the limit for re-election is capped at 75.\n\nA debate on extending Russia's lease of the naval base in the Black Sea in exchange for cheaper oil descended into a mass brawl, involving smoke bombs, eggs and general fighting among members. The Speaker had to be escorted from the chamber, covered by umbrellas.\n\nViolent scuffles broke out in the Ukrainian parliament on 24 May 2012 during a debate over a bill which would allow the official use of Russian language in certain parts of the country.\n\nTwo parliament members, Oleh Lyashko and Oleksandr Shevchenko, got into an argument on the floor. Shevchenko accused Lyashko, who had built an image as a combative opponent of pro-Russian separatists, of never having visited the separatist eastern region. The argument eventually led to Shevchenko punching Lyashko in the face.\n\nYuriy Boyko, of the centre-left Opposition Bloc, punched Oleg Lyashko in the face after the left-wing Radical Party member purportedly accused him of being a “Kremlin agent”.\n\nIn the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the government and the opposition are separated by red lines drawn on the carpet. The red lines in front of the two sets of benches are two sword-lengths apart (or a little more than two sword-lengths apart); a Member is traditionally not allowed to cross the line during debates, supposedly because the Member might then be able to attack an individual on the opposite side. These procedures were made because the Members were allowed to carry weapons into the House in its founding days.\n\nDuring a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on Bloody Sunday on the day before, Independent Socialist MP Bernadette Devlin punched the Conservative Party Home Secretary Reginald Maudling. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eyewitnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.\n\nIn the aftermath of a rancorous debate with Labour MPs over the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill, Conservative Michael Heseltine was enraged by a group who began singing \"The Red Flag\". He seized the chamber's ceremonial mace and brandished it over his head, but was restrained by Jim Prior, and after his departure legislative action was suspended for the day.\n\nFederalist Congressman Roger Griswold of Connecticut attacked Vermont Representative Matthew Lyon with a hickory walking stick in the chambers of the United States House of Representatives. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.\n\nThe two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.\n\nJohn Wilson, the speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives and president of the Arkansas Real Estate Bank, stabbed Representative J. J. Anthony to death during a legislative dispute on the floor of the chamber. Anthony had suggested that bounties for the killing of wolves be administered by the president of the state bank, a responsibility comically beneath an official of Wilson's stature. Incensed, he drew a bowie knife and attacked Anthony, who was unable to defend himself despite drawing a knife of his own. Although Wilson was expelled from his office, he was later acquitted of murder.\n\nCongressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina famously assaulted Charles Sumner of Massachusetts for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle Andrew Butler took \"a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery.\" After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman Laurence Keitt on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a \"drunkard\" and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a duel. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, \"Let them be!\" Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month. For several decades following, Senators often carried walking canes and even revolvers in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.\n\nCongressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when Pennsylvania Congressman (and later Speaker of the House) Galusha A. Grow stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black Republican puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. Cadwallader Washburn of Wisconsin upended the hairpiece of Rep. William Barksdale of Mississippi. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter. Keitt would later die of wounds following the Battle of Cold Harbor while fighting for the Confederacy.\n\nDuring an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican Owen Lovejoy on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as Roger Atkinson Pryor, grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.\n\nThe Indiana General Assembly experienced a massive brawl between Democrats and Republicans in the Indiana Senate and Indiana House of Representatives. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor Isaac P. Gray to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a midterm election for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the Indiana Supreme Court. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the Indiana Statehouse. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the Indianapolis Police Department to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be elected by popular vote.\n\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the Philippine Islands, Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina accused Senator John L. McLaurin of South Carolina of \"treachery\" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to Censure both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat Thomas Downey of New York confronted Robert Dornan, a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the Conservative Political Action Conference, in which he called Downey a \"draft-dodging wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment Contras rebels in Nicaragua. During the Vietnam War, Downey received a medical deferment from the draft because of a perforated eardrum. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill to tell him what had happened.\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the House Sergeant at Arms. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman Mike Lowry said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"\n\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the Alabama State Senate Republican Sen. Charles Bishop of Jasper punched Democratic Sen. Lowell Barron of Fyffe in the head after the latter allegedly called the former a \"son of a bitch\". The two were then pulled apart by bystanders in the room.\n\nDuring a vote of California budget state Assemblymen Warren Furutani and Don Wagner broke out in a fight over a comment Wagner made that Furutani deemed offensive.\n\nA bloody backroom brawl between the mayor and a council member at a city council meeting in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nDuring a contentious 2017 Texas House of Representatives session, a minor altercation was observed after State Representative Matt Rinaldi was pushed and received personal death threats. The incident occurred after Rinaldi called U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a large crowd of protesters, in opposition to the sanctuary cities ban, disrupted the legislative proceedings. Representative Poncho Nevárez admitted to laying hands on Rinaldi amid the fierce debates, but no arrests were made by Texas DPS.\n\nDeputy Alfonso Marquina protested the presence of a boisterous group of President Chávez supporters in the audience.\n\nDuring a session of the National Assembly . The origin of the discussion had to do with the rejection by National Assembly president Diosdado Cabello to give members of the opposition a right to speak.\n\nOn 5 July 2017, colectivos and supporters of President Nicolás Maduro stormed the Palacio Federal Legislativo on the Independence Day of Venezuela, assaulting many members of the opposition-led National Assembly. At least 12 opposition legislators and their staff were injured as a result of the attack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "293639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293639", "title": "Lift-to-drag ratio", "text": "Lift-to-drag ratio\n\nIn aerodynamics, the lift-to-drag ratio, or L/D ratio, is the amount of lift generated by a wing or vehicle, divided by the aerodynamic drag it creates by moving through the air. A higher or more favorable L/D ratio is typically one of the major goals in aircraft design; since a particular aircraft's required lift is set by its weight, delivering that lift with lower drag leads directly to better fuel economy in aircraft, climb performance, and glide ratio.\n\nThe term is calculated for any particular airspeed by measuring the lift generated, then dividing by the drag at that speed. These vary with speed, so the results are typically plotted on a 2D graph. In almost all cases the graph forms a U-shape, due to the two main components of drag.\n\nLift-to-drag ratios can be determined by flight test, by calculation or by testing in a wind tunnel.\n\nLift-induced drag is a component of total drag that arises whenever a finite span wing generates lift. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the lift versus velocity graph.\nForm drag is caused by movement of the aircraft through the air. This type of drag, also known as air resistance or profile drag varies with the square of speed (see drag equation). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming the right side of the lift/velocity graph's U shape. Profile drag is lowered primarily by streamlining and reducing cross section.\n\nLift, like drag, increases as the square of the velocity and the ratio of lift to drag is often plotted in terms of the lift and drag coefficients C and C. Such graphs are referred to as drag polars. Speed increases from left to right. The lift/drag ratio is given by the slope from the origin to some point on this curve and so the peak L/D ratio does not occur at the point of least drag, the leftmost point. Instead it occurs at a slightly higher speed. Designers will typically select a wing design which produces an L/D peak at the chosen cruising speed for a powered fixed-wing aircraft, thereby maximizing economy. Like all things in aeronautical engineering, the lift-to-drag ratio is not the only consideration for wing design. Performance at high angle of attack and a gentle stall are also important.\n\nAs the aircraft fuselage and control surfaces will also add drag and possibly some lift, it is fair to consider the L/D of the aircraft as a whole. As it turns out, the glide ratio, which is the ratio of an (unpowered) aircraft's forward motion to its descent, is (when flown at constant speed) numerically equal to the aircraft's L/D. This is especially of interest in the design and operation of high performance sailplanes, which can have glide ratios approaching 60 to 1 (60 units of distance forward for each unit of descent) in the best cases, but with 30:1 being considered good performance for general recreational use. Achieving a glider's best L/D in practice requires precise control of airspeed and smooth and restrained operation of the controls to reduce drag from deflected control surfaces. In zero wind conditions, L/D will equal distance traveled divided by altitude lost. Achieving the maximum distance for altitude lost in wind conditions requires further modification of the best airspeed, as does alternating cruising and thermaling. To achieve high speed across country, glider pilots anticipating strong thermals often load their gliders (sailplanes) with water ballast: the increased wing loading means optimum glide ratio at higher airspeed, but at the cost of climbing more slowly in thermals. As noted below, the maximum L/D is not dependent on weight or wing loading, but with higher wing loading the maximum L/D occurs at a faster airspeed. Also, the faster airspeed means the aircraft will fly at higher Reynolds number and this will usually bring about a lower zero-lift drag coefficient.\n\nMathematically, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio can be estimated as:\n\nwhere \"AR\" is the aspect ratio, formula_2 the span efficiency factor, a number less than but close to unity for long, straight edged wings, and formula_3 the zero-lift drag coefficient.\n\nMost importantly, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is independent of the weight of the aircraft, the area of the wing, or the wing loading.\n\nIt can be shown that two main drivers of maximum lift-to-drag ratio for a fixed wing aircraft are wingspan and total wetted area. One method for estimating the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft is the equivalent skin-friction method. For a well designed aircraft, zero-lift drag (or parasite drag) is mostly made up of skin friction drag plus a small percentage of pressure drag caused by flow separation. The method uses the equation:\n\nwhere formula_5 is the equivalent skin friction coefficient, formula_6 is the wetted area and formula_7 is the wing reference area. The equivalent skin friction coefficient accounts for both separation drag and skin friction drag and is a fairly consistent value for aircraft types of the same class. Substituting this into the equation for maximum lift-to-drag ratio, along with the equation for aspect ratio (formula_8), yields the equation:\n\nwhere \"b\" is wingspan. The term formula_10 is known as the wetted aspect ratio. The equation demonstrates the importance of wetted aspect ratio in achieving an aerodynamically efficient design.\n\nAt very high speeds, lift to drag ratios tend to be lower. Concorde had a lift/drag ratio of around 7 at Mach 2, whereas a 747 is around 17 at about mach 0.85.\n\nDietrich Küchemann developed an empirical relationship for predicting L/D ratio for high Mach:\n\nwhere M is the Mach number. Windtunnel tests have shown this to be roughly accurate.\n\nA House sparrow has a 4:1 L/D ratio, a Herring gull a 10:1 one, a Common tern 12:1 and an Albatross 20:1, to be compared to 8.3:1 for the Wright Flyer to 17.7:1 for a Boeing 747 in cruise.\nA cruising Airbus A380 reaches 20:1.\nThe Concorde at takeoff and landing had a 4:1 L/D ratio, increasing to 12:1 at Mach 0.95 and 7.5:1 at Mach 2.\nA Helicopter at has a 4.5:1 L/D ratio.\nA Cessna 172 glides at a 10.9:1 ratio.\nA cruising Lockheed U-2 has a 25.6 L/D ratio.\nThe Rutan Voyager had a 27:1 ratio and the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer 37:1.\n\nIn gliding flight, the L/D ratios are equal to the glide ratio (when flown at constant speed).\n\n\n"}

Maha Kapphina was his monastic name. He became disciple of Buddha and is one of the five hundred Arahants who will be born as future Buddhas, according to the Buddhist beliefs. The reference to Kapphina is found in the Jatakas, \"Manorathapurani\", the commentary on Dhammapada, Visuddh magga, Samyutta Saratthappakasini Commentary, Simuutta Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya, Vinaya Pitaka, Theragāthā, Theragāthā Commentary etc., as well as in the Sanskrit \"Avadanashatika\".\n\nKapphina was born in a city called Kukkata (Kukkutavati according to some accounts) in a kingdom, three hundred yojanas in extent. It was a frontier kingdom, located near Himavanta or \"Himalaya\" and was ruled by his father on whose death, he became its ruler under the name Maha Kapphina—Kapphina or Kappina being probably his appellative rather than a given name. His chief queen \"Anoja\" was a princess from \"Sagala\" of the Madra kingdom.\nSoon after ascending the throne, Kappina got attracted towards Buddhism through the medium of traders from Savatthi (Sarasvati in eastern UP) who had visited Kukkatavati and told him about of the appearance in the world of Buddha, the Law, and the Sangha. Immediately on hearing this news, King Maha Kapphina and his thousand courtiers and Queen Anoja and her thousand ladies-in-waiting had given splendid gifts and set out to visit and see the Buddha in person. In this manner they crossed three rivers on dry foot: the Aravacchā, the Nilavāhana, and the Chandrabhaga on making Acts of Truth. The Buddha perceived them coming with his divine eye, and after he had eaten at Savatthi, went through the air to the banks of river Chandrabhaga (Chenab) and sat down under the great banyan tree facing the landing stage of the river. Maha Kapphina and his men saw the Buddha and prostrated themselves before him. The Buddha taught them the Doctrine and they all retired from the world, became arahants and joined the Order. Maha Kapphina exclaims wherever he goes: \"\"aho sukham!, aho sukham\"!!\" (\"Oh happiness!\", \"Oh happiness!!\"!). The monks conclude that Kapphina has in mind the happiness of ruling. The Buddha informs that Kapphina refers to the happiness of Nibhana.\n\nNothing definite is known about Maha Kapphina. He is mentioned both in the Buddhist as well as in Sanskrit literature. In Buddhist literature, he is stated to be king of Kukkatavati located beyond river Indus either in North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan, in North-east Afghanistan or in Kashmir. But Medieval age Buddhist writer Śivasvāmin, the court poet of Avantivarman (855 AD - 883 AD), in his poetical composition (Avadanashatika) refers to Maha Kapphina as the king of \"Lilavati\", the lord of Vindhya as well as king of \"Daksinatya\" etc. Since Śivasvāmin is a very belated author (9th century AD), the scholar community does not give much credence to his version of Maha Kapphina legend compared to that from the ancient Buddhist texts.\n\nThe internal evidence of Kapphina legend tends to locate Kukkatavati somewhere near Pukkhlavati or Mashkavati in NWFP. It is notable that several similar ending names such as \"Utpalavati, Hamsavati, Oghavati (Apaga), Pokkharavatī\" (Sanskrit \"Pushkavati\") and Pāṇinian \"Mashkavati\" (i.e. Massaga of Arrian) are documented in the NWFP.\n\nDivyavadana attests a city called Utpalavati located in Uttarapatha. The ancient name of Sanskrit Pushkalavati, Pali Pokkharavati or Pushkaravati is said to have been Utpalavati and was located above the confluence of Swat and Kabul river, modern Charasadda. The story of Rupavati (\"Rupavatyavadana\") specifically equates this \"Utpalavati\" to the \"Pushkalavati\" (modern Charasaddha, north of Peshawar). Thus, it has been conjectured that city of Kukkatavati may have been in NWFP of Pakistan or somewhere near Pushkalavati or Mashkavati (Massaga), or in north-east Afghanistan, in the land of Ashvaka Kambojas. The marriage of king Kapphina to Anoja, the princess of Madda (Madra) kingdom also points to this direction.\n\nIt has been suggested that the very name Kapphina or Kappina may be related to Chinese \"Kipin or Kapin or Greek Kophene\". Kipin of Chinese is the same as Kophene of the Greek writings and the Kubha and/or Kapisa of the Sanskrit literature. Pāṇini teaches that the name of the Kamboja king could be same as the name of his kingdom. It therefore looks quite probable that name Kapphina was not a proper name but an appellation of its ruler and likewise may be related to name Kipin, Kapin and Kophene which are the Chinese and the Greek versions of the Sanskrit Kubha (Kabul) and Kapisa respectively. Equivalence of Kabul and Kapisa with Kamboja has also been accepted by scholar community.\n\nAlexander Cunningham writes: \"Kipin is one of the most famous but also most puzzling terms of the Chinese geography of north-western India (now Pakistan). As a geographical term the word 'Kipin' is not to be found in Indian literature. We come acrorss King Maha Kapphina or Maha Kaphina, the hero of the many Buddhist legends. He is described as ruling in Kukutavati, a frontier region and this region is definitely localized in the extreme north-west of India (now Pakistan). According to Buddhist traditions, Kaphina was a Brahman. He met the Buddha during the latter's journey to the north-west. Kukatagiri, as mentioned by Pāṇini (V. 4. 147) seems to represent some low peaks of Hindukush in Afghanistan. Thus, Kipin or Kukutawati was situated in Afghanistan near the borders of Pakistan. It is probably Huphina of Hiuen Tsang or Huppian which is Kophen (=the kingdom of Kabul). King Kapphina of the Buddhist legends was the king of this region\".\n\nKing Maha Kapphina was, in all probability a powerful ruler whose kingdom besides Kabul (Kophene), probably also included parts of Gandhara. Kipin described in the Hou Han-shu may represent the region NWFP (now in Pakistan) dominated in turn by the Greeks, the Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushanas\".\n\nMaha Kapphina is said to have met Buddha after crossing three northern rivers i.e. river Aravacchā (probably \"Swat?\"), the Nīlavāhana and the Chandrabhaga. This shows that he must have come from north/north-west as river Chandrabhaga is identified with river Chenab and Nīlavāhana with river Indus (Nilab).\n\nAccording to scholars like D. D. Kosambi, Kapphina was of a Kshatriya varna but according to Alexander Cunningham, Kapphina was of a Brahman varna. But these conflicting views are least problematic here since Kambojas in ancient times were given to both Kshatrya as well as Brahmanical pursuits. Pali texts' legend of Maha Kapphina however, does not specify anywhere that Kapphina was a Brahmin or a Kshatriya. But internal evidence of Kapphina legend points to his belonging to the Kshatriya varna.\n\nMaha Kapphina is described by Buddha as pale (or white) (\"? odata\"), thin and having a characteristic thin and prominent nose (\"tanukam tunganasikam\"). Thus, the personal features, especially the Aryan nose also resemble that of a man from the North/north-west and therefore the Kambojas/Gandharas.\n\nAnguttara Nikaya mentions sixteen great countries that flourished during Buddha's time of which only two i.e. the ‘Gandhara–Kashmira’ and the ‘Kamboja’ were located in Uttarapatha. \"Culla-Niddesa\" adds the Kalinga to the sixteen and substitutes Yona for the Gandhāra thus showing that when Chulla-Niddesa was composed, Kamboja Mahajanapada in the Uttarapatha was more important than even the Gandhara and further indicates that Gandhara may have formed part of the Kamboja Mahajanapada at this time. \"In Buddha's time, Gandhāra and Kasmira formed one country since the two countries are always mentioned together in one expression as \"Kasmīra-Gandhāra\" in the Pali texts\". According to Gandhara Jataka, Kasmira was included in Gandhara. In Buddha's time, Pukkusāti, contemporary of the Buddha was the king of Gandhara i.e. \" 'Gandhara-Kasmira' \". As he learnt about the appearance of Buddha, his Dharama and Sangha from his friend king Bimbisara, Pukkusati immediately decided to become a Buddha follower, ordained himself as a monk, renounced his kingdom and traveled all the way to \"Sāvatthi\" to see the Buddha. Pali texts refer to Maha Kapphina as a great king of the frontier kingdom of Kukkutavati, 300 Yojana in extent, (in Uttarapatha) and also make him contemporary of the Buddha and Pukkusati. Immediately on hearing of the appearance of Buddha and his Law and Sangha, king Maha Kapphina of Kukkatavati renounced the throne, set forth towards Savatthi to see the Buddha, and like king Pukkusati, he too became a Buddha follower and a monk. The above Buddhist evidence makes it quite clear that Pukkusati and Maha Kapphina were contemporary rulers, both belonged to the \"Uttarapatha\", both abnegated the throne and both had become monks and Buddha followers soon after the appearance of Buddha's Law and Sangha. Since according to Pali textual evidence, Pukkusati was king of ‘Gandhara-Kasmira’, hence his contemporary king Maha Kapphina, said to be a great ruler of a frontier country (hence also from Uttarapatha), could not have been a king either of Gandhara or of Kasmira, as D. D. Kosambi speculates. This clearly means that Maha Kapphina could only have been a king of Kamboja alone (\"the only other Mahajanapada or great country located in the Uttarapatha division). And being immediate neighbor to Gandhara, king Maha Kapphina had followed king Pukkusati or vice versa and embraced the Buddhist faith.\n\nGeneral Alexander Cunningham has identified Kukkatavati kingdom of Maha Kapphina with Chinese Kipin (=Pāṇinian Kapisa) or Greek \"Kophene\" and the \"Kukatagiri\" with some low peak of Hindukush region, which obviously refers to the land of ancient Kambojas. D . D. Kosambi has located Kukkatavati of king Maha Kapphina near Kamboja (or Kashmir). Scholars like Gauri Shankar and Michael Hahn as well as the authors of \"Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference\" and of \"Indian Linguistics\" also connect Kipin of the Chinese records with Buddhist name Kapphina but identify Kipin with Kashmir. But it is generally accepted among the scholar community that the Chinese name Kipin is applied to Kapisa country which was a part of ancient Kamboja (See: Kapisa Province). Hence Kapphina and Kapin/Kipin must be related not to Kashmir but to the Kapisa (\"Kafiristan/Kohistan\") and to Kophene (Kabul) and therefore, to the Kamboja. Since Ashvakas of Mashkavati (Massaga) and Kunar valleys were merely a specialized branch (i.e. \"Ashva-Yuddha-Kushalah\") of the more general ethnic term Kamboja, hence D. D.Kosambi's views also reinforce the conclusion that Maha Kaphina was probably a ruler of the Ashvaka country of the Kambojas which around the time of Buddha was only a provincial district of the bigger Kamboja Mahajanapada. \"It is also not very insignificant to note that there still exists among the modern Kamboj a clan name known as Kukkar (< Kukkad/Kukkat) who claim to have come to Punjab from north-west across the Indus\".\n\n"}

She has presented performance art pieces through television broadcasts, which she called \"social performances\" involving the non-arts public. She also designs sets, costumes, and props for theatre, television, and cinema.\n\nShe studied at Escuela Nacional de Pintura Y Escultura \"La Esmeralda,\" one of the two top art schools in Mexico, from 1968 to 1973.\n\nIn the 1970s, she began working as a conceptual artist, participating in the Groups (\"Los Grupos\") Movement in México City. She worked with the group NO GRUPO since its founding in 1979, until its dissolution six years later. SInce producing her first happening in 1971, she has researched non-traditional narratives.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1983, No Grupo staged several performances each year. In 1979, Bustamante spearheaded their extremely satirical \"Patente del Taco\" (1984\")\". The piece primarily consisted of Bustamante’s application for and reception of a patent for the taco, an indigenous Mexican food. The taco and patent were photographed in erotic ways, with the food arranged vertically and decorated with slogans such as “Atrévase a cometer un acto erótico cómase un taco” (commit an erotic act: eat a taco). The images were then blown up to a cartoonish side to symbolize the inflated role of machismo in Mexican culture.\n\nIn 1983, with Mónica Mayer, she founded the first feminist art collective in Mexico, Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder). Bustamante and Mayer's work combined radical social criticism and humour, exemplified by the group’s name: “Black Hen Powder – to protect us from the patriarchal magic which makes women disappear.”\n\nFor one performance, ¡MADRES! (1984), Bustamante and Mayer became pregnant at the same time so they could experience the conditions of pregnancy in Mexico. One element of the performance was a television series on Canal 2 de Televisa Mexico called “Mother for a Day,” in which Bustamante and Mayer “impregnated” famous men like anchorman Guillermo Ochoa (1987). A key discussion topic on the show was domestic life, with a focus on the massive amount of labor that goes into motherhood.\n"}
{"id": "1080015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1080015", "title": "Miscarriage of justice", "text": "Miscarriage of justice\n\nA miscarriage of justice, also known as a failure of justice, is when an actually innocent person is found guilty and punished. The term can also apply to errors in the other direction—\"errors of impunity\", and to a wrongful deportation in deportation proceedings. Most criminal justice systems have some means to overturn, or \"quash\", a wrongful conviction, but this is often difficult to achieve. In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades, or until after the innocent person has been executed, released from custody, or has died.\n\n\"Miscarriage of justice\" is sometimes synonymous with wrongful conviction, referring to a conviction reached in an unfair or disputed trial. Wrongful convictions are frequently cited by death penalty opponents as cause to eliminate death penalties to avoid executing innocent persons. In recent years, DNA evidence has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages (viz. Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) have a word, the Swedish variant of which is \"justitiemord\", which literally translates as \"justice murder.\" The term exists in several languages and was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death. While a miscarriage of justice is a Type I error for falsely identifying culpability, an error of impunity would be a Type II error of failing to find a culpable person guilty. However, the term \"miscarriage of justice\" is often used to describe the latter type as well.\n\nWith capital punishment decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted. The retention of the term \"murder\" represents both universal abhorrence against wrongful convictions and awareness of how destructive wrongful convictions are. Some Slavic languages have also the word (\"justičná vražda\" in Slovak, \"justiční vražda\" in Czech) which literally translates as \"justice murder\", but it is used for Judicial murder, while miscarriage of justice is \"justiční omyl\" in Czech, implying an error of the justice system, not a deliberate manipulation.\n\nThe term is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. Show trials (not in the sense of high publicity, but in the sense of lack of regard to the actual legal procedure and fairness), due to their character, often lead to such travesties.\n\nThe concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for standard of review, in that an appellate court will often only exercise its discretion to correct plain error when a miscarriage of justice (or \"manifest injustice\") would otherwise occur.\n\nCauses of miscarriages of justice include:\n\nA risk of miscarriages of justice is one of the main arguments against the death penalty. Where condemned persons are executed promptly after conviction, the most significant effect of a miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous pardons—which essentially void the conviction—or have their convictions quashed. Many death penalty states hold condemned persons for ten or more years before execution, so that any new evidence that might acquit them (or, at least, provide reasonable doubt) will have had time to surface.\n\nEven when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires the victims of miscarriage of justice to be compensated.\n\nVarious studies estimate that in the United States, between 2.3 and 5% of all prisoners are innocent. One study estimated that up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.\n\nA 2014 study estimated that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent, and that at least 340 innocent people may have been executed since 1973.\n\nAccording to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in Ramat Gan in Israel, most wrongful convictions are for crimes less serious than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.\n\nWrongful convictions appear at first to be \"rightful\" arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime. If the conviction turns out to be a miscarriage of justice, then one or both of these statements is ultimately deemed to be false. During this time between the miscarriage of justice and its correction, the public holds false beliefs about the occurrence of a crime, the perpetrator of a crime, or both. While the public audience of a miscarriage of justice certainly varies, they may in some cases be as large as an entire nation or multitude of nations.\n\nIn cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.\n\nMass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society's fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control. Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.\n\nThere are unfavorable psychological effects, even in the absence of any public knowledge. In an experiment, participants significantly reduced their pro-social behavior after being wrongfully sanctioned. As a consequence there were negative effects for the entire group. The extent of wrongful sanctions varies between societies.\n\nIn 1959, 14-year-old Steven Truscott was convicted of raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl. Originally sentenced to death by hanging, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released on parole in 1969, and was freed from his parole restrictions in 1974. In 2007, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned Truscott's conviction, based on a reexamination of forensic evidence. The government of Ontario awarded him $6.5 million in compensation.\n\nIn 1972, Donald Marshall Jr., a Mi'kmaq man, was wrongly convicted of murder. Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted in 1983. The case inspired a number of questions about the fairness of the Canadian justice system, especially given that Marshall was an Aboriginal: as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation put it, \"The name Donald Marshall is almost synonymous with 'wrongful conviction' and the fight for native justice in Canada.\" Marshall received a lifetime pension of $1.5 million in compensation and his conviction resulted in changes to the Canada Evidence Act so that any evidence obtained by the prosecution must be presented to the defence on disclosure.\n\nIn 1970, David Milgaard was wrongfully convicted for the rape and murder of Gail Miller. He was released in 1992 and compensated $10 million by the Saskatchewan government after having spent 23 years in prison. After being tied to it by DNA evidence, serial rapist Larry Fisher (murderer) was convicted of the murder in 1999.\n\nIn 1992, Guy Paul Morin was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1995, new testing of DNA evidence showed Morin could not have been the murderer, and the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his conviction. The case has been described as \"a compendium of official error – from inaccurate eyewitness testimony and police tunnel vision, to scientific bungling and the suppression of evidence.\" Morin received $1.25 million in compensation from the Ontario government.\n\nEnzo Tortora, a TV host on national RAI television, was accused of being a member of the Camorra and drug trafficking. He was arrested in 1983, and sentenced to ten years in jail in 1985, but acquitted of all charges on appeal in 1986.\n\nRaffaele Sollecito and American Amanda Knox were sentenced to 26 years imprisonment for the 2007 Murder of Meredith Kercher. They were released in 2011 after an appeal court found there was no credible evidence against them. Petty burglar Rudy Guede has been convicted of murder and sexual assault in connection with the death of Ms. Kercher.\n\nThe Schiedammerpark murder case, as well as the similarly overturned case of the Putten murder, led to the installation of the \"Posthumus I committee\", which analyzed what had gone wrong in the Schiedammerpark Murder case, and came to the conclusion that confirmation bias led the police to ignore and misinterpret scientific evidence (DNA). Subsequently, the so-called Posthumus II committee investigated whether other such cases might have occurred. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists, and decided to consider three of them further: the Lucia de Berk case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In these three cases, independent researchers (professors Wagenaar, van Koppen, Israëls, Crombag, and Derksen) claim confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.\n\nNorwegian police, courts, and prison authorities have been criticized and convicted on several occasions by the European Court of Human Rights for breaking the principle of innocent until proven guilty. However, the maximum penalty in Norway is normally no longer than 21 years. Thereby, most of the victims have been acquitted after their release from prison.\n\nOn December 31, 1996 in Miłoszyce, Poland, a 15-year-old girl was brutally raped and murdered. Tomasz Komenda, then 21, was arrested. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Komenda was regularly abused by fellow prisoners and guards, he tried to commit suicide 3 times. In 2018 when new evidence came out, Komenda was paroled and in May 2018 his conviction was overturned and Komenda was oficially exonerated by the Supreme Court of Poland. He and his barrister stated, that they would demand 18 000 000 PLN compensation.\n\nThe Constitution of Spain guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice.\n\nIn the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid compensation for the time they were incarcerated. This is currently limited by statute to a maximum sum of £1,000,000 for those who have been incarcerated for more than ten years and £500,000 for any other cases, with deductions for the cost of food and prison cell during that time. See also .\n\nRichard Foster, the Chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), reported in October 2018 that the single biggest cause of miscarriage of justice was the failure to disclose vital evidence.\n\nUntil 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the Birmingham Six, were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.\n\nEnglish law has no official means of correcting a \"perverse\" verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when William Herbert Wallace was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial \"without\" jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).\n\nDuring the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The West Midlands Serious Crime Squad became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the Criminal Cases Review Commission was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury's decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.\n\nIn 2002, the NI Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in R v Walsh: \"... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case.\" (See Christy Walsh (Case).)\n\nThe Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927 increased the jurisdiction of the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the Trial of Oscar Slater.\n\nReflecting Scotland's own legal system, which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) was established in April 1999. All cases accepted by the SCCRC are subjected to a robust and thoroughly impartial review before a decision on whether or not to refer to the High Court of Justiciary is taken.\n\nIn June 2012, the National Registry of Exonerations, a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University Law School, initially reported 873 individual exonerations in the U.S. from January 1989 through February 2012; the report called this number \"tiny\" in a country with 2.3 million people in prisons and jails, but asserted that there are far more false convictions than exonerations. By 2015, the number of individual exonerations was reported as 1,733, with 2015 having the highest annual number of exonerations since 1989.\n\nIn the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, \"it would be shouted from the rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man.\" The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.\n\nIn 2013, in Massachusetts, a chemist admitted tampering with evidence and falsifying results regarding over 21,000 drug convictions from 2004 to 2013 by not undertaking tests and stating untested results were positive for illegal drugs.\n\n\n\n"}

Young African American men and women, between the ages of 20-40, were invited to participate in and take an active leadership role in their local Affiliate Urban League programs and activities.\n\nThese auxiliary groups actively supported the Urban League movement by educating other young professionals about the movement, recruiting new members, volunteering, sponsoring educational initiatives like youth mentoring and tutoring programs, coordinating fundraisers for scholarships, and delivering personal and professional development and networking opportunities to young professionals in their local communities.\n\nAs these auxiliaries began to grow, the Affiliate leadership took note of their success and began to ponder the power of a national movement of young professionals across the country. Hugh Price, then president and CEO of the National Urban League, realized the need to make this potential national movement into a reality. He held a historic \"Young Professionals Dialog Session\" with over 200 young professionals in the New York area in April 1998. This dialog session, in addition to a white paper submitted by Marcus Mitchell, ignited the spark that led to the formation of a working group, tasked with establishing the framework and foundation for the National Urban League Young Professionals.\nUnder the direction of Annelle Lewis, senior vice president of affiliate development and programs, the working group again convened in New York in September 1998.\n\nThe National Urban League Young Professionals (NULYP) was unveiled at the 1999 National Urban League Annual Conference in Houston, TX. Marcus Mitchell assumed the role of president and under his leadership, the organization began to define itself and to carve out its role in the National Urban League movement. The leadership team met on regularly to refine the structure of the organization as well as to develop its first draft of by-laws. Soon thereafter, a special election was held to fill the open positions on the newly established NULYP executive board.\n\nToday, there are over 62 chapters and 5,500 members supporting Urban League affiliate offices located in 35 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn October 2014, the National Urban League Young Professionals announced a partnership with the Alabama Power Foundation to present the \"LEAD [YP]\" Conference, January 15–18, 2015 at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Center in Birmingham, Alabama. It was designed to equip today's diverse Millennials and Gen-Xers from across the nation with training and tools to be leaders in their communities.\n\nThe Presidents of the National Urban League

A diagram in the notation consists of several shapes linked together by lines. The notation has been studied extensively by Predrag Cvitanović, who used it to classify the classical Lie groups. It has also been generalized using representation theory to spin networks in physics, and with the presence of matrix groups to trace diagrams in linear algebra.\n\nIn the language of multilinear algebra, each shape represents a multilinear function. The lines attached to shapes represent the inputs or outputs of a function, and attaching shapes together in some way is essentially the composition of functions.\n\nIn the language of tensor algebra, a particular tensor is associated with a particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices. One advantage of this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.\n\nEach shape represents a matrix, and tensor multiplication is done horizontally, and matrix multiplication is done vertically.\n\nThe metric tensor is represented by a U-shaped loop or an upside-down U-shaped loop, depending on the type of tensor that is used.\nThe Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor is represented by a thick horizontal bar with sticks pointing downwards or upwards, depending on the type of tensor that is used.\n\nThe structure constants (formula_1) of a Lie algebra are represented by a small triangle with one line pointing upwards and two lines pointing downwards.\n\nContraction of indices is represented by joining the index lines together.\n\nSymmetrization of indices is represented by a thick zig-zag or wavy bar crossing the index lines horizontally.\n\nAntisymmetrization of indices is represented by a thick straight line crossing the index lines horizontally.\n\nThe determinant is formed by applying antisymmetrization to the indices.\n\nThe covariant derivative (formula_2) is represented by a circle around the tensor(s) to be differentiated and a line joined from the circle pointing downwards to represent the lower index of the derivative.\n\nThe diagrammatic notation is useful in manipulating tensor algebra. It usually involves a few simple \"identities\" of tensor manipulations.\n\nFor example, formula_3, where \"n\" is the number of dimensions, is a common \"identity\".\n\nThe Ricci and Bianchi identities given in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor illustrate the power of the notation\n\nThe notation has been extended with support for spinors and twistors.\n\n"}
{"id": "25335695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25335695", "title": "Perceptual learning", "text": "Perceptual learning\n\nPerceptual learning is learning better perception skills such as differentiating two musical tones from one another or categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise \nas in reading, seeing relations among chess pieces, knowing whether or not an X-ray image shows a tumor.\n\nSensory modalities may include visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex cognitive processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise. Underlying perceptual learning are changes in the neural circuitry. The ability for perceptual learning is retained throughout life.\n\nLaboratory studies reported many examples of dramatic improvements in sensitivities from appropriately structured perceptual learning tasks. In visual Vernier acuity tasks, observers judge whether one line is displaced above or below a second line. Untrained observers are often already very good with this task, but after training, observers' threshold has been shown to improve as much as 6 fold. Similar improvements have been found for visual motion discrimination and orientation sensitivity.\nIn visual search tasks, observers are asked to find a target object hidden among distractors or in noise. Studies of perceptual learning with visual search show that experience leads to great gains in sensitivity and speed. In one study by Karni and Sagi, the time it took for subjects to search for an oblique line among a field of horizontal lines was found to improve dramatically, from about 200ms in one session to about 50ms in a later session. With appropriate practice, visual search can become automatic and very efficient, such that observers do not need more time to search when there are more items present on the search field. Tactile perceptual learning has been demonstrated on spatial acuity tasks such as tactile grating orientation discrimination, and on vibrotactile perceptual tasks such as frequency discrimination; tactile learning on these tasks has been found to transfer from trained to untrained fingers. Practice with Braille reading and daily reliance on the sense of touch may underlie the enhancement in tactile spatial acuity of blind compared to sighted individuals.\n\nPerceptual learning is prevalent and occurs continuously in everyday life. As our perceptual system adapts to the natural world, we become better at discriminating between different stimuli when they belong to different categories than when they belong to the same category. We also tend to become less sensitive to the differences between two instances of the same category. These effects are described as the result of categorical perception. Categorical perception effects do not transfer across domains.\n\nInfants, when different sounds belong to the same phonetic category in their native language, tend to lose sensitivity to differences between speech sounds by 10 months of age. They learn to pay attention to salient differences between native phonetic categories, and ignore the less language-relevant ones.\n\nIn chess, expert chess players encode larger chunks of positions and relations on the board and require fewer exposures to fully recreate a chess board. This is not due to their possessing superior visual skill, but rather to their advanced extraction of structural patterns specific to chess.\n\nExtensive practice reading in English leads to extraction and rapid processing of the structural regularities of English spelling patterns. The word superiority effect demonstrates this—people are often much faster at recognizing words than individual letters.\n\nIn speech phonemes, observers who listen to a continuum of equally spaced consonant-vowel syllables going from /be/ to /de/ are much quicker to indicate that two syllables are different when they belonged to different phonemic categories than when they were two variants of the same phoneme, even when physical differences were equated between each pair of syllables.\n\nOther examples of perceptual learning in the natural world include the ability to distinguish between relative pitches in music, identify tumors in x-rays, sort day-old chicks by gender, taste the subtle differences between beers or wines, identify faces as belonging to different races, detect the features that distinguish familiar faces, discriminate between two bird species (\"great blue crown heron\" and \"chipping sparrow\"), and attend selectively to the hue, saturation and brightness values that comprise a color definition.\n\nThe fact that with huge amounts of practice, individuals can reach impressive perceptual expertise, whether in wine tasting, fabric evaluation or musical preference, has been well acknowledged for centuries, along with the prevalent idiom that \"practice makes perfect\". The first documented report, dating to the mid-19th century, is the earliest example of tactile training aimed at decreasing the minimal distance at which individuals can discriminate whether one or two points on their skin have been touched. It was found that this distance (JND, Just Noticeable Difference) decreases dramatically with practice, and that this improvement is at least partially retained on subsequent days. Moreover, this improvement is at least partially specific to the trained skin area. A particularly dramatic improvement was found for skin positions at which initial discrimination was very crude (e.g. on the back), though training could not bring the JND of initially crude areas down to that of initially accurate ones (e.g. finger tips). William James devoted a section in his Principles of Psychology (1890/1950) to \"the improvement in discrimination by practice\". He noted examples and emphasized the importance of perceptual learning for expertise. In 1918, Clark L. Hull, a noted learning theorist, trained human participants to learn to categorize deformed Chinese characters into categories. For each category, he used 6 instances that shared some invariant structural property. People learned to associate a sound as the name of each category, and more importantly, they were able to classify novel characters accurately. This ability to extract invariances from instances and apply them to classify new instances marked this study as a perceptual learning experiment. \n\nIt was not until 1969, however, that Eleanor Gibson published her seminal book \"The Principles of Perceptual learning and Development\" and defined the modern field of perceptual learning. She established the study of perceptual learning as an inquiry into the behavior and mechanism of perceptual change. By the mid-1970s, however, this area was in a state of dormancy due to a shift in focus to perceptual and cognitive development in infancy. Much of the scientific community tended to underestimate the impact of learning compared with innate mechanisms. Thus, most of this research focused on characterizing basic perceptual capacities of young infants rather than on perceptual learning processes.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a new wave of interest in perceptual learning due to findings of cortical plasticity at the lowest sensory levels of sensory systems. Our increased understanding of the physiology and anatomy of our cortical systems has been used to connect the behavioral improvement to the underlying cortical areas. This trend began with earlier findings of Hubel and Wiesel that perceptual representations at sensory areas of the cortex are substantially modified during a short (\"critical\") period immediately following birth. Merzenich, Kaas and colleagues showed that though neuroplasticity is diminished, it is not eliminated when the critical period ends. Thus, when the external pattern of stimulation is substantially modified, neuronal representations in lower-level (e.g. primary) sensory areas are also modified. Research in this period centered on basic sensory discriminations, where remarkable improvements were found on almost any sensory task through discrimination practice. Following training, subjects were tested with novel conditions and learning transfer was assessed. This work departed from earlier work on perceptual learning, which spanned different tasks and levels.\n\nA question still debated today is to what extent improvements from perceptual learning stems from peripheral modifications compared with improvement in higher-level readout stages. Early interpretations, such as that suggested by William James, attributed it to higher-level categorization mechanisms whereby initially blurred differences are gradually associated with distinctively different labels. The work focused on basic sensory discrimination, however, suggests that the effects of perceptual learning are specific to changes in low-levels of the sensory nervous system (i.e., primary sensory cortices). More recently, research suggest that perceptual learning processes are multilevel and flexible. This cycles back to the earlier Gibsonian view that low-level learning effects are modulated by high-level factors, and suggests that improvement in information extraction may not involve only low-level sensory coding but also apprehension of relatively abstract structure and relations in time and space.\n\nWithin the past decade, researchers have sought a more unified understanding of perceptual learning and worked to apply these principles to improve perceptual learning in applied domains.\n\nPerceptual learning effects can be organized into two broad categories: discovery effects and fluency effects. Discovery effects involve some change in the bases of response such as in selecting new information relevant for the task, amplifying relevant information or suppressing irrelevant information. Experts extract larger \"chunks\" of information and discover high-order relations and structures in their domains of expertise that are invisible to novices. Fluency effects involve changes in the ease of extraction. Not only can experts process high-order information, they do so with great speed and low attentional load. Discovery and fluency effects work together so that as the discovery structures becomes more automatic, attentional resources are conserved for discovery of new relations and for high-level thinking and problem-solving.\n\nWilliam James (\"Principles of Psychology\", 1890) asserted that \"My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind - without selective interest, experience is an utter chaos.\". His view was extreme, yet its gist was largely supported by subsequent behavioral and physiological studies. Mere exposure does not seem to suffice for acquiring expertise.\n\nIndeed, a relevant signal in a given behavioral condition may be considered noise in another. For example, when presented with two similar stimuli, one might endeavor to study the differences between their representations in order to improve one's ability to discriminate between them, or one may instead concentrate on the similarities to improve one's ability to identify both as belonging to the same category. A specific difference between them could be considered 'signal' in the first case and 'noise' in the second case. Thus, as we adapt to tasks and environments, we pay increasingly more attention to the perceptual features that are relevant and important for the task at hand, and at the same time, less attention to the irrelevant features. This mechanism is called attentional weighting.\n\nHowever, recent studies suggest that perceptual learning occurs without selective attention. Studies of such task-irrelevant perceptual learning (TIPL) show that the degree of TIPL is similar to that found through direct training procedures. TIPL for a stimulus depends on the relationship between that stimulus and important task events or upon stimulus reward contingencies. It has thus been suggested that learning (of task irrelevant stimuli) is contingent upon spatially diffusive learning signals. Similar effects, but upon a shorter time scale, have been found for memory processes and in some cases is called attentional boosting. Thus, when an important (alerting) event occurs, learning may also affect concurrent, non-attended and non-salient stimuli.\n\nThe time course of perceptual learning varies from one participant to another. Perceptual learning occurs not only within the first training session but also between sessions. Fast learning (i.e., within-first-session learning) and slow learning (i.e., between-session learning) involves different changes in the human adult brain. While the fast learning effects can only be retained for a short term of several days, the slow learning effects can be preserved for a long term over several months.\n\nResearch on basic sensory discriminations often show that perceptual learning effects are specific to the trained task or stimulus. Many researchers take this to suggest that perceptual learning may work by modifying the receptive fields of the cells (e.g., V1 and V2 cells) that initially encode the stimulus. For example, individual cells could adapt to become more sensitive to important features, effectively recruiting more cells for a particular purpose, making some cells more specifically tuned for the task at hand. Evidence for receptive field change has been found using single-cell recording techniques in primates in both tactile and auditory domains.\n\nHowever, not all perceptual learning tasks are specific to the trained stimuli or tasks. Sireteanu and Rettenback discussed discrimination learning effects that generalize across eyes, retinal locations and tasks. Ahissar and Hochstein used visual search to show that learning to detect a single line element hidden in an array of differently-oriented line segments could generalize to positions at which the target was never presented. In human vision, not enough receptive field modification has been found in early visual areas to explain perceptual learning. Training that produces large behavioral changes such as improvements in discrimination does not produce changes in receptive fields. In studies where changes have been found, the changes are too small to explain changes in behavior.\n\nThe Reverse Hierarchy Theory (RHT), proposed by Ahissar & Hochstein, aims to link between learning dynamics and specificity and the underlying neuronal sites. RHT proposes that naïve performance is based on responses at high-level cortical areas, where crude, categorical level representations of the environment are represented. Hence initial learning stages involve understanding global aspects of the task. Subsequent practice may yield better perceptual resolution as a consequence of accessing lower-level information via the feedback connections going from high to low levels. Accessing the relevant low-level representations requires a backward search during which informative input populations of neurons in the low level are allocated. Hence, subsequent learning and its specificity reflect the resolution of lower levels. RHT thus proposes that initial performance is limited by the high-level resolution whereas post-training performance is limited by the resolution at low levels. Since high-level representations of different individuals differ due to their prior experience, their initial learning patterns may differ. Several imaging studies are in line with this interpretation, finding that initial performance is correlated with average (BOLD) responses at higher-level areas whereas subsequent performance is more correlated with activity at lower-level areas. RHT proposes that modifications at low levels will occur only when the backward search (from high to low levels of processing) is successful. Such success requires that the backward search will \"know\" which neurons in the lower level are informative. This \"knowledge\" is gained by training repeatedly on a limited set of stimuli, such that the same lower-level neuronal populations are informative during several trials. Recent studies found that mixing a broad range of stimuli may also yield effective learning if these stimuli are clearly perceived as different, or are explicitly tagged as different. These findings further support the requirement for top-down guidance in order to obtain effective learning.\n\nIn some complex perceptual tasks, all humans are experts. We are all very sophisticated, but not infallible at scene identification, face identification and speech perception. Traditional explanations attribute this expertise to some holistic, somewhat specialized, mechanisms. Perhaps such quick identifications are achieved by more specific and complex perceptual detectors which gradually \"chunk\" (i.e., unitize) features that tend to concur, making it easier to pull a whole set of information. Whether any concurrence of features can gradually be chunked with practice or chunking can only be obtained with some pre-disposition (e.g. faces, phonological categories) is an open question. Current findings suggest that such expertise is correlated with a significant increase in the cortical volume involved in these processes. Thus, we all have somewhat specialized face areas, which may reveal an innate property, but we also develop somewhat specialized areas for written words as opposed to single letters or strings of letter-like symbols. Moreover, special experts in a given domain have larger cortical areas involved in that domain. Thus, expert musicians have larger auditory areas. These observations are in line with traditional theories of enrichment proposing that improved performance involves an increase in cortical representation. For this expertise, basic categorical identification may be based on enriched and detailed representations, located to some extent in specialized brain areas. Physiological evidence suggests that training for refined discrimination along basic dimensions (e.g. frequency in the auditory modality) also increases the representation of the trained parameters, though in these cases the increase may mainly involve lower-level sensory areas.\n\nIn 2005, Petrov, Dosher and Lu pointed out that perceptual learning may be explained in terms of the selection of which analyzers best perform the classification, even in simple discrimination tasks. They explain that the some part of the neural system responsible for particular decisions have specificity, while low-level perceptual units do not. In their model, encodings at the lowest level do not change. Rather, changes that occur in perceptual learning arise from changes in higher-level, abstract representations of the relevant stimuli. Because specificity can come from differentially selecting information, this \"selective reweighting theory\" allows for learning of complex, abstract representation. This corresponds to Gibson's earlier account of perceptual learning as selection and learning of distinguishing features. Selection may be the unifying principles of perceptual learning at all levels.\n\nIvan Pavlov discovered conditioning. He found that when a stimulus (e.g. sound) is immediately followed by food several times, the mere presentation of this stimulus would subsequently elicit saliva in a dog's mouth. He further found that when he used a differential protocol, by consistently presenting food after one stimulus while not presenting food after another stimulus, dogs were quickly conditioned to selectively salivate in response to the rewarded one. He then asked whether this protocol could be used to increase perceptual discrimination, by differentially rewarding two very similar stimuli (e.g. tones with similar frequency). However, he found that differential conditioning was not effective.\n\nPavlov's studies were followed by many training studies which found that an effective way to increase perceptual resolution is to begin with a large difference along the required dimension and gradually proceed to small differences along this dimension. This easy-to-difficult transfer was termed \"transfer along a continuum\".\n\nThese studies showed that the dynamics of learning depend on the training protocol, rather than on the total amount of practice. Moreover, it seems that the strategy implicitly chosen for learning is highly sensitive to the choice of the first few trials during which the system tries to identify the relevant cues.\n\nSeveral studies asked whether learning takes place during practice sessions or in between, for example, during subsequent sleep. The dynamics of learning are hard to evaluate since the directly measured parameter is performance, which is affected by both learning, inducing improvement, and fatigue, which hampers performance. Current studies suggest that sleep contributes to improved and durable learning effects, by further strengthening connections in the absence of continued practice. Both slow-wave and REM (rapid eye movement) stages of sleep may contribute to this process, via not-yet-understood mechanisms.\n\nPractice with comparison and contrast of instances that belong to the same or different categories allow for the pick-up of the distinguishing features—features that are important for the classification task—and the filter of the irrelevant features.\n\nLearning easy examples first may lead to better transfer and better learning of more difficult cases. \nBy recording ERPs from human adults, Ding and Colleagues investigated the influence of task difficulty on the brain mechanisms of visual perceptual learning. Results showed that difficult task training affected earlier visual processing stage and broader visual cortical regions than easy task training.\n\nActive classification effort and attention are often necessary to produce perceptual learning effects. However, in some cases, mere exposure to certain stimulus variations can produce improved discriminations.\n\nIn many cases, perceptual learning does not require feedback (whether or not the classification is correct). Other studies suggest that block feedback (feedback only after a block of trials) produces more learning effects than no feedback at all.\n\nDespite the marked perceptual learning demonstrated in different sensory systems and under varied training paradigms, it is clear that perceptual learning must face certain unsurpassable limits imposed by the physical characteristics of the sensory system. For instance, in tactile spatial acuity tasks, experiments suggest that the extent of learning is limited by fingertip surface area, which may constrain the underlying density of mechanoreceptors.\n\nIn many domains of expertise in the real world, perceptual learning interacts with other forms of learning. Declarative knowledge tends to occur with perceptual learning. As we learn to distinguish between an array of wine flavors, we also develop a wide range of vocabularies to describe the intricacy of each flavor.\n\nSimilarly, perceptual learning also interacts flexibly with procedural knowledge. For example, the perceptual expertise of a baseball player at bat can detect early in the ball's flight whether the pitcher threw a curveball. However, the perceptual differentiation of the feel of swinging the bat in various ways may also have been involved in learning the motor commands that produce the required swing.\n\nPerceptual learning is often said to be implicit, such that learning occurs without awareness. It is not at all clear whether perceptual learning is always implicit. Changes in sensitivity that arise are often not conscious and do not involve conscious procedures, but perceptual information can be mapped onto various responses.\n\nIn complex perceptual learning tasks (e.g., sorting of newborn chicks by sex, playing chess), experts are often unable to explain what stimulus relationships they are using in classification. However, in less complex perceptual learning tasks, people can point out what information they're using to make classifications.\n\nAn important potential application of perceptual learning is the acquisition of skill for practical purposes. Thus it is important to understand whether training for increased resolution in lab conditions induces a general upgrade which transfers to other environmental contexts, or results from mechanisms which are context specific. Improving complex skills is typically gained by training under complex simulation conditions rather than one component at a time. Recent lab-based training protocols with complex action computer games have shown that such practice indeed modifies visual skills in a general way, which transfers to new visual contexts. In 2010, Achtman, Green, and Bavelier reviewed the research on video games to train visual skills. They cite a previous review by Green & Bavelier (2006) on using video games to enhance perceptual and cognitive abilities. A variety of skills were upgraded in video game players, including \"improved hand-eye coordination, increased processing in the periphery, enhanced mental rotation skills, greater divided attention abilities, and faster reaction times, to name a few\". An important characteristic is the functional increase in the size of the effective visual field (within which viewers can identify objects), which is trained in action games and transfers to new settings. Whether learning of simple discriminations, which are trained in separation, transfers to new stimulus contexts (e.g. complex stimulus conditions) is still an open question.\n\nLike experimental procedures, other attempts to apply perceptual learning methods to basic and complex skills use training situations in which the learner receives many short classification trials. Tallal, Merzenich and their colleagues have successfully adapted auditory discrimination paradigms to address speech and language difficulties. They reported improvements in language learning-impaired children using specially enhanced and extended speech signals. The results applied not only to auditory discrimination performance but speech and language comprehension as well.\n\nIn educational domains, recent efforts by Philip Kellman and colleagues showed that perceptual learning can be systematically produced and accelerated using specific, computer-based technology. Their approach to perceptual learning methods take the form of perceptual learning modules (PLMs): sets of short, interactive trials that develop, in a particular domain, learners' pattern recognition, classification abilities, and their abilities to map across multiple representations. As a result of practice with mapping across transformations (e.g., algebra, fractions) and across multiple representations (e.g., graphs, equations, and word problems), students show dramatic gains in their structure recognition in fraction learning and algebra. They also demonstrated that when students practice classifying algebraic transformations using PLMs, the results show remarkable improvements in fluency at algebra problem solving. These results suggests that perceptual learning can offer a needed complement to conceptual and procedural instructions in the classroom.\n\nSimilar results have also been replicated in other domains with PLMs, including anatomic recognition in medical and surgical training, reading instrumental flight displays, and apprehending molecular structures in chemistry.\n\n"}
{"id": "1098754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1098754", "title": "Pluralistic ignorance", "text": "Pluralistic ignorance\n\nIn social psychology, pluralistic ignorance is a situation in which a majority of group members privately reject a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it, and therefore go along with it. This is also described as \"no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes\". In short, pluralistic ignorance is a bias about a social group, held by the members of that social group.\n\nPluralistic ignorance may help to explain the bystander effect. If no-one acts, onlookers may believe others believe action is incorrect, and may therefore themselves refrain from acting.\n\nPrentice and Miller found that, on average, private levels of comfort with drinking practices on campus were much lower than the perceived average. In the case of men, they found a shifting of private attitudes toward this perceived norm, a form of cognitive dissonance. Women, on the other hand, were found to have an increased sense of alienation on the campus but lacked the attitude change detected in men, presumably because norms related to alcohol consumption on campus are much more central for men than for women. Research has shown that pluralistic ignorance plagues not only those who indulge, but also those who abstain: from gambling, smoking and drinking and among some who follow vegetarianism. The latter has found that pluralistic ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network, not cognitive dissonance.\n\nThe theory of pluralistic ignorance was studied by Floyd Henry Allport and his students Daniel Katz and Richard Schanck. He produced studies of racial stereotyping and prejudice, and attitude change, and his pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of organizational psychology. Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, in her spiral of silence theory, argued that media biases lead to pluralistic ignorance.\n\nPluralistic ignorance was blamed for exacerbating support for racial segregation in the United States. It has also been named a reason for the illusory popular support that kept the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in power, as many opposed the regime but assumed that others were supporters of it. Thus, most people were afraid to voice their opposition.\n\nAnother case of pluralistic ignorance concerns drinking on campus in countries where alcohol use is prevalent at colleges and universities. Students drink at weekend parties and sometimes at evening study breaks. Many drink to excess, some on a routine basis. The high visibility of heavy drinking on campus, combined with reluctance by students to show any public signs of concern or disapproval, gives rise to pluralistic ignorance: Students believe that their peers are much more comfortable with this behavior than they themselves feel.\nHans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" is a famous fictional case of pluralistic ignorance. In this story two con artists come into the Emperor's kingdom and convince him that they make the finest clothes in all of the land that can only be seen by anyone who was not stupid. The con artists continued to steal gold, silk and other precious items for their \"unique creation\". Out of fear for being seen as stupid, all of the emperor's men and townspeople kept silent about the fact they could not see the emperor's clothes until finally a small child comes forth and says that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. Once the child is willing to admit that he cannot see any clothes on the emperor, the emperor and townspeople finally admit that the emperor has been tricked and that there was never an outfit being made.\n\nPluralistic ignorance has also been blamed for large majorities of the public remaining silent on climate change — while 'solid majorities' of the American and UK public are concerned about climate change, most erroneously believe they are in the minority with their concern. It's been suggested that pollution-intensive industries have contributed to the public's underestimation of public support for climate solutions. For example, in the U.S., support for pollution pricing is high, yet public perception of public support is much lower.\n\nHowever, some will argue that pluralistic ignorance is why public concern for climate change exists at all.\n\nMen's conceptions of how they are expected to conform to norms of masculinity present additional examples of pluralistic ignorance. Specifically, most men are uncomfortable with other men \"bragging about sexual acts and giving details,\" but erroneously believe themselves to be in the minority for their discomfort. Similarly, men underestimate other men's \"desire to make sure they have consent when sexually active.\" This \"role-conflict\" can have deleterious consequences for men's physical and mental health, as well as for society.\n\nPluralistic ignorance has been linked to a wide range of deleterious consequences. For example, victims of pluralistic ignorance see themselves as deviant members of their peer group: less knowledgeable than their classmates, more uptight than their peers, less committed than their fellow board members, less competent than their fellow nurses (see the Dunning–Kruger effect operating in the opposite direction). This can leave them feeling bad about themselves and alienated from the group or institution of which they are a part. In addition, pluralistic ignorance can lead groups to persist in policies and practices that have lost widespread support: This can lead college students to persist in heavy drinking, corporations to persist in failing strategies, and governments to persist in unpopular foreign policies. At the same time, it can prevent groups from taking actions that would be beneficial in the long run: actions to intervene in an emergency, for example, or to initiate a personal relationship.\n\nPluralistic ignorance can be dispelled, and its negative consequences alleviated, through education. For example, students who learn that support for heavy drinking practices is not as widespread as they thought drink less themselves and feel more comfortable with the decision not to drink. Alcohol intervention programs now routinely employ this strategy to combat problem drinking on campus.\n\nPluralistic ignorance can be contrasted with the false consensus effect. In pluralistic ignorance, people privately disdain but publicly support a norm (or a belief), while the false consensus effect causes people to wrongly assume that most people think like they do, while in reality most people do not think like they do (and express the disagreement openly). For instance, pluralistic ignorance may lead a student to drink alcohol excessively because she believes that everyone else does that, while in reality everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking, but no one expresses that due to the fear of being ostracized. A false consensus for the same situation would mean that the student believes that most other people do not enjoy excessive drinking, while in fact most other people do enjoy that and openly express their opinion about it. \n\nA study done by Greene, House, and Ross used simple circumstantial questionnaires on Stanford undergrads to gather info on FCE. They compiled thoughts on the choice they felt people would or should make, considering traits such as shyness, cooperativeness, trust, and adventurousness. Studies found that when explaining their decisions, participants gaged choices based on what they explained as \"people in general\" and their idea of \"typical\" answers. For each of the stories those subjects said that they personally would follow a given behavioral alternative also tended to rate that alternative as relatively probable for \"people in general\": those subjects who claimed that they would reject the alternative tended to rate it as relatively improbable for \"people in general\". It was evident that the influence of the subjects' own behavior choice affected the estimates of commonness. Although it would seem as if the two are built on the same premise of social norms, they take two very oppositional stances on a similar phenomenon. The false consensus effect considers that in predicting an outcome, people will assume that the masses agree with their opinion and think the same way they do on an issue, whereas the opposite is true of pluralistic ignorance, where the individual does not agree with a certain action but go along with it anyway, believing that their view is not shared with the masses (which is usually untrue).\n\n"}
{"id": "5491788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5491788", "title": "Representational systems (NLP)", "text": "Representational systems (NLP)\n\nRepresentational systems (also known as sensory modalities and abbreviated to VAKOG or known as the 4-tuple) is a postulated model from neuro-linguistic programming, a pseudoscientific collection of models and methods regarding how the human mind processes and stores information. The central idea of this model is that experience is represented in the mind in sensorial terms, i.e. in terms of the putative five senses, qualia.\n\nAccording to Bandler and Grinder our chosen words, phrases and sentences are indicative of our referencing of each of the representational systems. So for example the words \"black\", \"clear\", \"spiral\" and \"image\" reference the \"visual\" representation system; similarly the words \"tinkling\", \"silent\", \"squeal\" and \"blast\" reference the \"auditory\" representation system. Bandler and Grinder also propose that ostensibly metaphorical or figurative language indicates a reference to a representational system such that it is actually \"literal\". For example, the comment \"I see what you're saying\" is taken to indicate a visual representation.\n\nFurther, Bandler and Grinder claim that each person has a \"most highly valued\" (now commonly termed \"preferred\") representational system in which they are more able to vividly create an experience (in their mind) in terms of that representational system, tend to use that representational system more often than the others, and have more distinctions available in that representation system than the others. So for example a person that most highly values their visual representation system is able to easily and vividly visualise things and has a tendency to do so in preference to creating or recreating an experience in terms of the other representational system.\n\nRepresentational systems are one of the foundational ideas of NLP and form the basis of many NLP techniques and methods.\n\nFor many practical purposes, according to NLP, mental processing of events and memories can be treated as if performed by the five senses. For example, Einstein credited his discovery of special relativity to a mental visualization strategy of \"sitting on the end of a ray of light\", and many people as part of decision-making \"talk to themselves\" in their heads.\n\nThe manner in which this is done, and the effectiveness of the mental strategy employed, is stated by NLP to play a critical part in the way mental processing takes place. This observation led to the concept of a \"preferred\" representational system, the classification of people into fixed \"visual\", \"auditory\" or \"kinesthetic\" stereotypes. This idea was later discredited and dropped within NLP by the early 1980s, in favor of the understanding that most people use all of their senses (whether consciously or unconsciously), and that whilst one system may seem to dominate, this is often contextualized - globally there is a balance that dynamically varies according to circumstance and mood.\n\nNLP asserts that for most circumstances and most people, three of the five sensory based modes seem to dominate in mental processing:\nThe other two senses, gustatory (taste) and olfactory (smell), which are closely associated, often seem to be less significant in general mental processing, and are often considered jointly as one.\n\nFor this reason, one often sees the term \"VAK\" in NLP reference texts, to signify these three primary representational systems, as well as the term \"4-tuple\" (or \"VAKOG\") if the author wishes to include all senses including taste/smell. The same term is also known as \"First Access\" (John Grinder), or \"primary experience\" (Freud).\n\nIn documenting mental strategies and processing by the senses, NLP practitioners often use a simple shorthand for different modalities, with a letter indicating the representation system concerned, and often, a superscript to indicate how that system is being used. Three key aspects are commonly notated: The \"representation system\" being used (visual/V, auditory/A, kinesthetic/K, and occasionally, O/G), whether the \"direction of attention\" is internal or external , and whether the event is a \"recollection\" of an actual past event or \"construction\" of an imaginary event . Due to its importance in human cognitive processing, auditory internal dialogue, or talking in one's head, has its own shorthand: A.\n\nPutting these together, this is a very simplified example of some steps which might actually be involved in replying to a simple question such as \"Do you like that dress?\". The table below is useful for teaching how to identify and access each representational system in context:\n\nLogically, these or similar steps \"must\" take place somewhere in consciousness in order to cognitively make sense of the question and answer it. A sequence of this kind is known in NLP as a \"strategy\" - in this case, a functional outline of the strategy used by the mind in answering that question. In a similar way, the process leading to a panic attack of the form \"I see the clock, ask myself where the kids are, imagine everything that could be happening and feel scared\" might be notated as having a subjective structure: V → A → V → K, signifying that an external sight leads to internal dialog (a question), followed by internal and constructed images, leading to a feeling.\n\nGenerally speaking, most human perceptual and cognitive processing occurs before conscious awareness. For example, few people would ordinarily be aware that between question and even considering an answer, there must be steps in which the mind interprets and contextualizes the question itself, and steps which explore various possible strategies to be used to obtain an answer and select one to be followed. The mental occurrence of these steps is often identified by deduction following skilled observation, or by careful inquiry, although their presence is usually self-apparent to the person concerned once noticed.\n\nGrinder and Bandler believed they identified pattern of relationship between the sensory-based language people use in general conversation, and for example, their eye movement (known as \"eye accessing cues\").\n\nA common (but not universal) style of processing in the West is shown in the attached chart, where \"eye flickers\" in specific directions often seem to tie into specific kinds of internal (mental) processing.\n\nNLP also suggests that sometimes (again not universally) such processing is associated with sensory word use; for example, a person asked what they liked about the beach, may flick their eyes briefly in some characteristic direction (visual memory access, often upwards) and then also use words that describe it in a visual sense (\"The sea \"looked\" lovely\", and so on). Likewise asked about a problem, someone may look in a different direction for a while (kinesthetic access, typically downwards) and then look puzzled and say \"I just can't seem to \"get a grip\" on things\". Taken together, NLP suggests such eye accessing cues (1) are idiosyncratic and habitual for each person, and (2) may form significant clues as to how a person is processing or representing a problem to themselves unconsciously.\nCommon (but not universal) Western layout of eye accessing cues:\n\nEye movement to the left or right for many people seems to indicate if a memory was recalled or constructed. Thus remembering an actual image (V) is associated more with up-left, whilst imagining one's dream home (V) tends (again not universally) to be more associated with up-right.\n\nWhen we think about the world, or about our past experiences, we represent those things inside our heads. For example, think about the holiday you went on last year. Did you see a picture of where you went, tell yourself a story about what you did, feel the sun on your back and the wind in your hair? Can you bring to mind the smell of your favourite flower or the taste of a favourite meal??\n\nThe use of the various modalities can be identified based by learning to respond to subtle shifts in breathing, body posture, accessing cues, gestures, eye movement and language patterns such as sensory predicates.\n\nNLP's interest in the senses is not so much in their role as bridges to the outside world, but in their role as internal channels for cognitive processing and interpretation. In an NLP perspective, it is not very important \"per se\" whether a person \"sees\" or \"hears\" some memory. By contrast, NLP views it as potentially of great importance for the same person, to discover that some auditory sounds presented almost out of consciousness along with the memory, may be how the brain presents to consciousness, and how consciousness \"knows\", whether this is a heart-warming pleasant memory, or a fearsome phobic one.\n\nRepresentational systems are also relevant since some tasks are better performed within one representational system than by another. For example, within education, spelling is better learned by children who have unconsciously used a strategy of visualization, than an unconscious strategy of phonetically \"sounding out\". When taught to visualize, previously poor spellers can indeed be taught to improve. NLP proponents also found that pacing and leading the various cues tended to build rapport, and allowed people to communicate more effectively. Certain studies suggest that using similar representational systems to another person can help build rapport whilst other studies have found that merely mimicking or doing so in isolation is perceived negatively.\n\nSkinner and Stephens (2003) explored the use of the model of representational systems in television marketing and communications.\n\nSome exercises in NLP training involve learning how to observe and respond to the various cues in real time.\n\nOriginally NLP taught that people preferred one representational system over another. People could be stuck by thinking about a problem in their \"preferred representational system\" (PRS). Some took this idea further and categorised people as auditory, kinesthetic, and visual thinkers (see also: learning styles). It was claimed that swifter and more effective results could be achieved by matching this preferred system. Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movement can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment, the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s. Some still believe the PRS model to be important for enhancing rapport and influence. Others have de-emphasized its relevance and instead emphasize that people constantly use all representational systems. In particular, new code emphasizes individual calibration and sensory acuity, precluding such a rigidly specified model as the one described above. Responding directly to sensory experience requires an immediacy which respects the importance of context. John Grinder has stated that a representational system diagnosis lasts about 30 seconds.\n\nIn a review of research findings, Sharpley (1987) found little support for individuals to have a \"preferred\" representational system (PRS), whether in the choice of words or direction of eye movement, and the concept of a \"preferred representation system\" (PRS). Similarly, The National Research Committee found little support for the influence of PRS as presented in early descriptions of NLP, Frogs into Princes (1979) and Structure of Magic (1975). However, \"at a meeting with Richard Bandler in Santa Cruz, California, on July 9, 1986, the [National Research Committee] influence subcommittee... was informed that PRS was no longer considered an important component of NLP. He said that NLP had been revised.\" (p. 140) The NLP developers, Robert Dilts et al. (1980) proposed that eye movement (and sometimes bodily gesture) correspond to accessing cues for representations systems, and connected it to specific sides in the brain.\n\n"}

{"id": "324305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324305", "title": "Right to privacy", "text": "Right to privacy\n\nThe right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. Over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy.\n\nSince the global surveillance disclosures of 2013, initiated by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden, the inalienable human right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. In combating worldwide terrorism, government agencies, such as the NSA, CIA, R&AW and GCHQ, have engaged in mass, global surveillance.\n\nThere is now a question as whether the right to privacy act can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyse virtually in every detail of an individual's life. A major question is that whether or not the right to privacy needs to be forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats.\n\nPrivate sector actors could also threaten the right to privacy. Increasingly, questions have arisen about the use of personal data for targeted advertising, sharing data with external parties and reusing personal data within big data by large technology giants, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, revealing that the psychographic company Cambridge Analytica was using personal data, illegitimately obtained through Facebook, to manipulate and influence large groups of people, including during the 2016 US Presidential elections.\n\nState of consideration of constitutional laws and acts formed by sectors and sections\n\nPrivacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In the United States, an article in the December 15, 1890 issue of the \"Harvard Law Review\", written by attorney Samuel D. Warren and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, entitled \"The Right to Privacy\", is often cited as the first explicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the \"right to be let alone\", and focused on protecting individuals. This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as \"yellow journalism\".\n\nPrivacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in \"Olmstead v. United States\" (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 article \"The Right to Privacy\". But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying \"the government [was] identified...as a potential privacy invader.\" He writes, \"Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\" At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles.\n\nIn recent years there has been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define the \"right to privacy\". In 2005, students of the Haifa Center for Law & Technology asserted that in fact the right to privacy \"should not be defined as a separate legal right\" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient. Other experts, such as William Prosser, have attempted, but failed, to find a \"common ground\" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition. One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of \"privacy in the digital environment,\" suggests that the \"right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.\" It has therefore proposed a working definition for a \"right to privacy\":\n\nThe right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.\n\nAlan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as \"the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:\n\nEach individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.\n\nUnder liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression.\n\nDavid Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".\n\nMarc Rotenberg has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: \"the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information.\" Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.\n\nRichard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\". Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.\n\nThere have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies. Amitai Etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order. Etzioni believes that \"[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others\", and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight. He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.\n\nPriscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".\n\nLeslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.\n\nA right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, the Supreme Court has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion from the First Amendment, Third Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. This right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of civil liberties cases, including \"Pierce v. Society of Sisters\", which invalidated a successful 1922 Oregon initiative requiring compulsory public education, \"Griswold v. Connecticut\", where a right to privacy was first established explicitly, \"Roe v. Wade\", which struck down a Texas abortion law and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against abortion, and \"Lawrence v. Texas\", which struck down a Texas sodomy law and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against sodomy.\n\nThe 1890 Warren and Brandeis article \"The Right To Privacy\" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. This right is frequently debated. Strict constructionists argue that such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be surveillance (wiretaps, public cameras film industry, etc.).\n\nMost states of the United States also grant a right to privacy and recognize four torts based on that right:\n\nThe four privacy torts above were introduced by William Prosser in his \"California Law Review\" article titled \"Privacy\" in 1960. Some argue that these torts, along with the \"Right to Privacy\" article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis form the basis for modern U.S. privacy legislation.\n\nAlso, in some American jurisdictions the use of a person's name as a keyword under Google's AdWords for advertising or trade purposes without the person's consent has raised certain personal privacy concerns.\n\nRight to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California’s “online erasure” law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. However, the United States is still far behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors.\n\nA nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar, ruled on August 24, 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India (mostly under Article 21 and additionally under Part III rights). Thus no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for encroachment of any Article 21 right – legality-i.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object. This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power. This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalisation of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalising same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private. India is the world’s biggest democracy and with this ruling, it has joined United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union and the UK in recognizing this fundamental right.\n\nThe new data sharing policy of Whatsapp with Facebook after Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must decide if the right to privacy can be enforced against private entities.\n\nIt is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the media, that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press. The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public have a right to know personal information about those with status as a public figure. This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of freedom of speech.\n\nGovernmental organizations such as the NSA, CIA, and GCHQ amongst others conduct mass surveillance throughout the world. Programs such as PRISM, MYSTIC, and other operations conducted by NATO-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. The existence of programs is justified by their conductors in terms of supposed benefits for defense and law enforcement, however this is also in conflict with the right to privacy established under various treaties, constitutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The argument in favor of privacy has therefore come under a larger opposition to intelligence operations carried out for political purposes, and has become a contentious issue since it undermines the perceived need of nations to spy on the general population in order to maintain their power structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Philosophers Richard Brandt and Brad Hooker are major proponents of such approach.\n\nFor rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, \"always stop at red lights\"). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances.\n\nIn his 1863 book \"Utilitarianism\", John Stuart Mill defends the concept of rights in terms of utility: \"To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general utility.\" Whether Mill was a rule utilitarian is a matter of controversy. This passage from \" Utilitarianism\" seems to suggest that he was:\n\nIn the case of abstinences indeed—of things which people forbear to do from moral considerations, though the consequences in the particular case might be beneficial—it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be consciously aware that the action is of a class which, if practiced generally, would be generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the obligation to abstain from it.\n\nBut Mill also argues that it is sometimes right to violate general ethical rules:\n\n... justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, regarded collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule any one of the general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical practitioner.\nOther things being equal people are happier if their society follows rules so people know what types of behaviour they can expect from others in given situations. Therefore, utilitarians can justify a system that goes, \"Keep to the rules unless there is a strong reason for breaking them.\"\n\nStrong rule utilitarianism (SRU) gives a utilitarian account for the claim that moral rules should be obeyed at all places and times. SRU does not deteriorate into act utilitarianism like weak rule utilitarianism, but it shares weaknesses with similarly absolutist moral stances (notably, deontological ones). A scenario (or thought experiment) used to clarify this problem (often attributed to Immanuel Kant) posits both\n\n\nThe moral convention is that lying is wrong, so the strong rule utilitarian says you should reveal their location. A more sophisticated SRU response is that\n\n\nNevertheless, many disagree, claiming that (in this situation) telling the truth would result in needless death, would therefore be immoral, and that this scenario thus provides a counterexample contradicting SRU.\n\nWeak rule utilitarianism (WRU) attempts to handle SRU counterexamples as legitimate exceptions. One such response is two-level utilitarianism; more systematic WRUs attempt to create sub-rules to handle the exceptions. But as David Lyons and others have argued, this will necessarily tend to collapse into act utilitarianism. Rules will require as many sub-rules as there are exceptions, thus many exceptions will make the more-sophisticated rule computationally intractable. Rational agents will then satisfice that intractability by seeking outcomes that produce the maximum utility.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39704", "title": "Social contract", "text": "Social contract\n\nIn both moral and political philosophy, the social contract is a theory or model that originated during the Age of Enlightenment and usually concerns the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining rights.\n\nTherefore, the relation between natural and legal rights is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from \"The Social Contract\" (French: \"Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique\"), a 1762 book by Jean-Jacques Rousseau that discussed this concept.\n\nAlthough the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law, the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the \"state of nature\". In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.\n\nProminent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include Hugo Grotius (1625), Thomas Hobbes (1651), Samuel von Pufendorf (1673), John Locke (1689), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762), and Immanuel Kant (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had natural rights. Thomas Hobbes famously said that in a \"state of nature\", human life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the \"right to all things\" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless \"war of all against all\" (\"bellum omnium contra omnes\"). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political community (civil society) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war. Alternatively, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.\n\nThe central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the \"general will\" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.\n\nLocke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19thcentury in favor of utilitarianism, Hegelianism, and Marxism, and were revived in the 20thcentury, notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls.\n\nThe concept of the social contract was originally posed by Glaucon, as described by Plato in \"The Republic\", BookII.\n\nThe social contract theory also appears in \"Crito\", another dialogue from Plato. Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after Epicurus (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also Epicurean ethics), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society. As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.\n\nSocial contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records. The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, Mahāvastu, recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:\nIn his rock edicts, the Buddhist king Asoka was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist \"vinaya\" also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.\n\nEpicurus in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his \"Principal Doctrines\" (see also Epicurean ethics):\n\nQuentin Skinner has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the Low Countries who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England. Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), from the School of Salamanca, might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing natural law in an attempt to limit the divine right of absolute monarchy. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular sovereignty by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-\"state of nature\" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.\n\nThese arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which \"a populus\" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.\n\nIn the early 17th century, Grotius (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had \"natural rights\" that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of natural law that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his \"On the Law of War and Peace\" that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.\n\nThe idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are \"sui juris\" (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.\n\nThe first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the state of nature were \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the \"social\", or society. Life was \"anarchic\" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.\n\nThe social contract was an \"occurrence\" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their individual rights so that others would cede theirs. This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer \"a war of all against all\".\n\nThe state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the realism theories of international relations, advanced by E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau. Hobbes wrote in \"Leviathan\" that humans (\"we\") need the \"terrour of some Power\" otherwise humans will not heed the law of reciprocity, \"(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to\".\n\nJohn Locke's conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a \"neutral judge\", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.\n\nWhile Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his \"Second Treatise of Government\". Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or \"self-preservation\"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise \"The Social Contract\", outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of political rights based on unlimited popular sovereignty. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their representative government. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and inalienable. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their \"real will\", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader (\"the Legislator\") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.\n\nRousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the \"luminous conception\" (which he credited to Denis Diderot) of the general will. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an egoist but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.\n\nRousseau's striking phrase that man must \"be forced to be free\" should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as citizens). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.\n\nThus, enforcement of laws, including criminal law, is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.\n\nWhile Rousseau's social contract is based on popular sovereignty and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by individualists, libertarians, and anarchists that do not involve agreeing to anything more than negative rights and creates only a limited state, if any.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:\n\nBuilding on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state, John Rawls (1921–2002), in \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical \"original position\" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a \"veil of ignorance\" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a game-theoretical formalization of the notion of fairness.\n\nDavid Gauthier \"neo-Hobbesian\" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics. Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the prisoner's dilemma. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result. In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.\n\nPhilip Pettit (b. 1945) has argued, in \"Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government\" (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the consent of the governed, should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be manufactured, Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.\n\nAn early critic of social contract theory was Rousseau's friend, the philosopher David Hume, who in 1742 published an essay \"Of Civil Liberty\". The second part of this essay, entitled \"Of the Original Contract\", stresses that the concept of a \"social contract\" is a convenient fiction: \n\nHume argued that consent of the governed was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. \n\nLegal scholar Randy Barnett has argued that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to \"all\" rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.A. Brownson, who argued that, in a sense, three \"constitutions\" are involved: first, the \"constitution of nature\" that includes all of what the Founders called \"natural law\"; second, the \"constitution of society\", an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a \"constitution of government\". To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be \"constitutional\" in that sense.\n\nThe theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.\n\nOther writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.\n\nThe theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent. The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation. Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.\n\nAccording to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay \"No Treason\" that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.\n\nModern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan\"; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.\n\n\n"}

The symmetric difference of the sets \"A\" and \"B\" is commonly denoted by\nor\nor\n\nFor example, the symmetric difference of the sets formula_4 and formula_5 is formula_6.\n\nThe power set of any set becomes an abelian group under the operation of symmetric difference, with the empty set as the neutral element of the group and every element in this group being its own inverse. The power set of any set becomes a Boolean ring with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.\n\nThe symmetric difference is equivalent to the union of both relative complements, that is:\n\nThe symmetric difference can also be expressed using the XOR operation ⊕ on the predicates describing the two sets in set-builder notation:\n\nThe same fact can be stated as the indicator function (which we denote here by formula_9) of the symmetric difference being the XOR (or addition mod 2) of the indicator functions of its two arguments: formula_10 or using the Iverson bracket notation formula_11.\n\nThe symmetric difference can also be expressed as the union of the two sets, minus their intersection:\n\nIn particular, formula_13; the equality in this non-strict inclusion occurs if and only if formula_14 and formula_15 are disjoint sets. Furthermore, if we denote formula_16 and formula_17, then formula_18 and formula_19 are always disjoint, so formula_18 and formula_19 partition formula_22. Consequently, assuming intersection and symmetric difference as primitive operations, the union of two sets can be well \"defined\" in terms of symmetric difference by the right-hand side of the equality\n\nThe symmetric difference is commutative and associative (and consequently the leftmost set of parentheses in the previous expression were thus redundant):\n\nThe empty set is neutral, and every set is its own inverse:\n\nTaken together, we see that the power set of any set \"X\" becomes an abelian group if we use the symmetric difference as operation. (More generally, any field of sets forms a group with the symmetric difference as operation.) A group in which every element is its own inverse (or, equivalently, in which every element has order 2) is sometimes called a Boolean group; the symmetric difference provides a prototypical example of such groups. Sometimes the Boolean group is actually defined as the symmetric difference operation on a set. In the case where \"X\" has only two elements, the group thus obtained is the Klein four-group.\n\nEquivalently, a Boolean group is an elementary abelian 2-group. Consequently, the group induced by the symmetric difference is in fact a vector space over the field with 2 elements Z. If \"X\" is finite, then the singletons form a basis of this vector space, and its dimension is therefore equal to the number of elements of \"X\". This construction is used in graph theory, to define the cycle space of a graph.\n\nFrom the property of the inverses in a Boolean group, it follows that the symmetric difference of two repeated symmetric differences is equivalent to the repeated symmetric difference of the join of the two multisets, where for each double set both can be removed. In particular:\n\nThis implies triangle inequality: the symmetric difference of \"A\" and \"C\" is contained in the union of the symmetric difference of \"A\" and \"B\" and that of \"B\" and \"C\". (But note that for the diameter of the symmetric difference the triangle inequality does not hold.)\n\nIntersection distributes over symmetric difference:\nand this shows that the power set of \"X\" becomes a ring with symmetric difference as addition and intersection as multiplication. This is the prototypical example of a Boolean ring.\nFurther properties of the symmetric difference:\n\n\nThe symmetric difference can be defined in any Boolean algebra, by writing\nThis operation has the same properties as the symmetric difference of sets.\n\nThe repeated symmetric difference is in a sense equivalent to an operation on a multiset of sets giving the set of elements which are in an odd number of sets.\n\nAs above, the symmetric difference of a collection of sets contains just elements which are in an odd number of the sets in the collection:\nEvidently, this is well-defined only when each element of the union formula_43 is contributed by a finite number of elements of formula_44.\n\nSuppose formula_45 is a multiset and formula_46. Then there is a formula for formula_47, the number of elements in formula_48, given solely in terms of intersections of elements of formula_44:\n\nAs long as there is a notion of \"how big\" a set is, the symmetric difference between two sets can be considered a measure of how \"far apart\" they are. \nFirst consider a finite set \"S\" and the counting measure on subsets given by their size. Now consider two subsets of \"S\" and set their distance apart as the size of their symmetric difference. This distance is in fact a metric so that the power set on \"S\" is a metric space. If \"S\" has \"n\" elements, then the distance from the empty set to \"S\" is \"n\", and this is the maximum distance for any pair of subsets.\n\nUsing the ideas of measure theory, the separation of measurable sets can be defined to be the measure of their symmetric difference. \nIf μ is a σ-finite measure defined on a σ-algebra Σ, the function\nis a pseudometric on Σ. \"d\" becomes a metric if Σ is considered modulo the equivalence relation \"X\" ~ \"Y\" if and only if formula_52. It is sometimes called Fréchet-Nikodym metric. The resulting metric space is separable if and only if L(μ) is separable.\n\nIf formula_53, we have: formula_54. Indeed,\n\nLet formula_56 be some measure space and let formula_57 and formula_58.\n\nSymmetric difference is measurable: formula_59.\n\nWe write formula_60 iff formula_61. The relation \"formula_62\" is an equivalence relation on the formula_63-measurable sets.\n\nWe write formula_64 iff to each formula_65 there's some formula_66 such that formula_67. The relation \"formula_68\" is a partial order on the family of subsets of formula_63.\n\nWe write formula_70 iff formula_64 and formula_72. The relation \"formula_62\" is an equivalence relationship between the subsets of formula_63.\n\nThe \"symmetric closure\" of formula_75 is the collection of all formula_63-measurable sets that are formula_62 to some formula_65. The symmetric closure of formula_75 contains formula_75. If formula_75 is a sub-formula_82-algebra of formula_63, so is the symmetric closure of formula_75.\n\nformula_60 iff formula_86 formula_87-a.e.\n\nThe Hausdorff distance and the (area of the) symmetric difference are both pseudo-metrics on the set of measurable geometric shapes. However, they behave quite differently. The figure at the right shows two sequences of shapes, \"Red\" and \"Red ∪ Green\". When the Hausdorff distance between them becomes smaller, the area of the symmetric difference between them becomes larger, and vice versa. By continuing these sequences in both directions, it is possible to get two sequences such that the Hausdorff distance between them converges to 0 and the symmetric distance between them diverges, or vice versa.\n\n"}

The teardrop is one of the most widely recognised prison tattoos and has various meanings.\n\nIt can signify that the wearer has spent time in prison; or more specifically that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed by the rapist as a \"property\" mark and for humiliation, since facial tattoos cannot be concealed.\n\nIt can acknowledge the loss of a family or fellow gang member; the tattoo is sometimes worn by the female companions of prisoners in solidarity with their loved ones. Amy Winehouse had a teardrop tattooed to mark her distress at husband Blake Fielder-Civil remaining on remand at Pentonville Prison. US rappers The Game and Lil Wayne have teardrop tattoos signifying the death of friends, and basketball player Amar'e Stoudemire has had a teardrop tattoo since 2012 honoring his older brother Hazell Jr., who died in a car accident.\n\nIn some cases, it may signify that the wearer has killed someone. Sometimes the exact meaning of the tattoo is only known by the wearer. The tattoo's meaning also can change depending on whether the tear is empty or is filled with ink.\n\nA teardrop tattoo has been worn by a Portuguese footballer Ricardo Quaresma.\n\n"}

{"id": "4082874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4082874", "title": "Workplace bullying", "text": "Workplace bullying\n\nWorkplace bullying is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm. It can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical school bully, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, bullying in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates. Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture. It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice\n\nThe first known documented use of \"workplace bullying\" is in 1992 in a book by Andrea Adams called \"Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It\".\n\nWhile there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:\n\nBecause it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:\n\nThis distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of job stress and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae. Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.\n\nAccording to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.\n\nEuphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment. Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.\n\nThere is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a \"mob\" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries. In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland. Workplace bullying is primarily used in Australia, UK, and Northern Europe.\n\nBosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims. Statistics from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.\n\nAlthough socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life suggest that \"workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity\". Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.\n\nIn 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando wrote a doctoral research dissertation on \"Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity\". The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.\n\nIn terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007) states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).\n\nIn the research of Samnani and Singh (2012), it concludes the findings from previous 20 years' literature and claims that in terms of the gender factor, inconsistent findings could not support the differences across gender.\n\nIn a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).\n\nRace also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007), the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:\n\nThe reported rates of witnessing bullying were:\n\nThe percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:\n\nResearch psychologist Tony Buon published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.\n\nHigher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.\n\nHigher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.\n\nLower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.\n\nWith respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.\n\nAmong industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).\n\nFor occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.\n\nResearchers Caitlin Buon and Tony Buon have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging They state that the \"bully\" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions and emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal interactions.\n\nBased on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are supervisors. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers. The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: \n\nBullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.\n\nBullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.\n\nHowever, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.\n\nIn addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually \"win\" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.\n\nMaarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.\n\nThe third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.\n\nThe fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a \"bully.\"\n\nThese cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to \"legitimately exercise\" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.\n\nAlthough the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.\n\nBullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that\nthey have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive\nand bullying behaviour. Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as\nacceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.\n\nWhen bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own aggression onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the boardroom may actually threaten the productivity of the entire organisation.\n\nResearch investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. \nOne's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).\n\nHumane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).\nPerformance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value interpersonal relationships to a greater degree.\n\nThree broad dimensions have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and individualism versus collectivism (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).\n\nIn Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.\n\nAshforth discussed potentially destructive sides of leadership and identified what he referred to as petty tyrants, i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace. Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. When employees get the sense that bullies \"get away with it,\" a climate of fear may be the result. Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling conflicts or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.\n\nIn a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered leaving the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had \"got away with it\" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.\n\nThe workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a \"kiss up kick down\" personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise. Bullies tend to ingratiate themselves to their bosses while intimidating subordinates. They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine\ntheir fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered \"kiss up kick down\" tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.\n\nAs a consequence of this \"kiss up kick down\" strategy: \n\nThe most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – \"fight or flight\" – and\nthese are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.\n\nFighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.\n\nWith some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.\n\n\nResearch by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:\n\nAccording to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:\n\nAccording to Hoel and Cooper, common abusive workplace behaviours are:\nAbusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.\n\nSeveral aspects of academia, such as the generally decentralized nature of academic institutions and the particular recruitment and career procedures, lend themselves to the practice of bullying and discourage its reporting and mitigation.\n\nBullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports, which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a vicious circle. This is often used in combination with manipulation and coercion of facts to gain favour among higher ranking administrators.\n\nA culture of bullying is common in information technology (IT), leading to high sickness rates, low morale, poor productivity and high staff turnover. Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT workers.\n\nBullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.\n\nBullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.\n\nSchool teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.\n\nBullying in the legal profession is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this. Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.\n\nBullying exists to varying degrees in the military of some countries, often involving various forms of hazing or abuse by higher members of the military hierarchy.\n\nBullying can be common in volunteering settings. For example, one study found bullying to be the most significant factor of complaints amongst volunteers \n. Volunteers often do not have access to protections available to paid employees, so while laws may indicate that bullying is a violation of rights, volunteers may have no means to address it.\n\nTim Field suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:\n\nAdult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves (\"Adult Bullying\"). \n\nWorkplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.\n\nAbusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.\n\nA power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:\n\nWorkplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.\n\nWorkplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.\n\nIn 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the University of Surrey, UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at Broadmoor Hospital in the UK. They found that three out of eleven personality disorders were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:\n\nThey described these business people as successful psychopaths and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.\n\nAccording to leading leadership academic Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries, it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.\n\nIndustrial/organizational psychology research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.\n\nNarcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical\ncross-over between bullies and psychopaths. Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates. Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:\n\nA corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and divide and rule.\n\nPeople with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.\n\nA workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have psychopathic traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.\n\nIn 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, found that narcissism revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.\n\nAccording to Namie, Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, schizophrenia and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.\n\nAccording to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al., workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.\n\nAccording to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at Arizona State University, \"workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs.\" Stress is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of \"sick days\" or time off from work (Farrell & Geist-Martin, 2005).\n\nThe negative effects of bullying are so severe that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even suicide are not uncommon. Tehrani found that one in 10 targets experience PTSD, and that 44% of her respondents experienced PTSD similar to that of battered women and victims of child abuse. Matthiesen and Einarsen found that up to 77% of targets experience PTSD.\n\nIn addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion. Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.\n\nAccording to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).\n\nSeveral studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.\n\nResearch by Dr. Dan Dana has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately managing conflict and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict. In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.\n\nWorkplace bullying is known in some Asian countries as:\n\n\n\nWorkplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard & LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack & Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017). One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014). \nReferences:\nEvans-Lacko, S., & Knapp, M.

{"id": "4528497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4528497", "title": "Yuanmou Man", "text": "Yuanmou Man\n\nYuanmou Man (), \"Homo erectus yuanmouensis\", refers to a member of the genus \"Homo\" whose remnants, two incisors, were discovered near Danawu Village in Yuanmou County in southwestern province of Yunnan, China. Later, stone artifacts, pieces of animal bone showing signs of human work and ash from campfires were also dug up from the site. The fossils are on display at the National Museum of China, Beijing.\n\nThe remnants of Yuanmou Man were discovered on May 1, 1965, by the geologist Fang Qian, who was working for the Geological Mechanics Research Institute. Based on the palaeomagnetic dating of the rock they were found in, it was initially estimated that the fossils were about 1.7 Ma and thus represented the earliest fossils of human ancestors found in China and East Asia. It was once thought to be possibly predated by \"Wushan Man\", but that has turned out to be a stem-orangutan (Ponginae).\n\nThe dating has been indirectly questioned by Geoffrey Pope who argued that evidence does not support the appearance of hominidae in Asia prior to 1 million years ago. (this skepticism has since lifted, with additional findings in the last 25 years). There are still, however, conflicting opinions regarding the age of the Yuanmou Fm. and Yuanmou Man. You et al. (1978) suggested that Member 4 in the upper part of the formation is middle Pleistocene and should be designated the Shangnabang Fm., while the sediments exposed at Shagou containing \"Enhydriodon\" cf. \"falconeri\" should be designated the Shagou Fm. with an age\nof Pliocene.\n\nLiu et al. (1983) believed the age of Yuanmou Man was Middle Pleistocene, did not exceed 0.73 Ma, and was probably contemporaneous with Peking Man. Subsequently, Qian (1985) conducted further studies of the age of Yuanmou Man, but still obtained an age of 1.7 Ma, or Early Pleistocene. These investigations initiated beneficial discussion, although further conflicting opinions persist regarding depositional environment, paleoclimatology, glaciation, and other aspects.\n\nAccording to Qian et al. (1991), palaeomagnetic dates from near where the teeth were recovered average 1.7 Ma. Older research by Liu and Ding (1984) noted that the faunal sequence at the site was inverted, with more extinct species in the upper levels than deeper in the deposit, and based on this evidence they suggest to put the age of the Yuanmou man into the Middle Pleistocene, that is about 0.5 - 0.6 Ma.\n\n"}
