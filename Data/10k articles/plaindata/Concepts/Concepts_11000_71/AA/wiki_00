The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be \"always already\" present.\n\n\"Always already\" literally translates the German phrase \"immer schon\" that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\". The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that Dasein, the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.\n\nOn the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, Louis Althusser observed that \"individuals are always-already subjects\" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such — indeed, even before birth. During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include literary theory, hermeneutics and deconstruction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "201572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201572", "title": "Anatta", "text": "Anatta\n\nIn Buddhism, the term anattā (Pali) or anātman (Sanskrit) refers to the doctrine of \"non-self\", that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in living beings. It is one of the seven beneficial perceptions in Buddhism, and along with \"Dukkha\" (suffering) and \"Anicca\" (impermanence), it is one of three Right Understandings about the three marks of existence.\n\nThe Buddhist concept of Anattā or Anātman is one of the fundamental differences between Buddhism and Hinduism, with the latter asserting that Atman (self, soul) exists.\n\n\"Anattā\" is a composite Pali word consisting of \"an\" (not, without) and \"attā\" (soul). The term refers to the central Buddhist doctrine that \"there is in humans no permanent, underlying substance that can be called the soul.\" It is one of the three characteristics of all existence, together with \"dukkha\" (suffering, unsatisfactoriness) and \"anicca\" (impermanence).\n\n\"Anattā\" is synonymous with \"Anātman\" (an + ātman) in Sanskrit Buddhist texts. In some Pali texts, \"ātman\" of Vedic texts is also referred to with the term \"Attan\", with the sense of soul. An alternate use of \"Attan\" or \"Atta\" is \"self, oneself, essence of a person\", driven by the Vedic era Brahmanical belief that the soul is the permanent, unchangeable essence of a living being, or the true self.\n\nIn Buddhism-related English literature, \"Anattā\" is rendered as \"not-Self\", but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states Peter Harvey; a more complete rendering is \"non-Self\" because from its earliest days, \"Anattā\" doctrine denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of \"Dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). It is also incorrect to translate \"Anattā\" simply as \"ego-less\", according to Peter Harvey, because the Indian concept of \"ātman\" and \"attā\" is different from the Freudian concept of ego.\n\n\"Anatta\" or \"Anatta-vada\" is also referred to as the \"no-soul or no-self doctrine\" of Buddhism.\n\nThe concept of \"Anattā\" appears in numerous Sutta of the ancient Buddhist Nikāya texts (Pali canon). It appears, for example, as a noun in \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.141, IV.49, V.345, in Sutta II.37 of \"Anguttara Nikaya\", II.37–45 and II.80 of \"Patisambhidamagga\", III.406 of \"Dhammapada\". It also appears as an adjective, for example, in \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.114, III.133, IV.28 and IV.130–166, in Sutta III.66 and V.86 of \"Vinaya\".\n\nThe ancient Buddhist texts discuss \"Attā\" or \"Attan\" (soul, self), sometimes with alternate terms such as \"Atuman\", \"Tuma\", \"Puggala\", \"Jiva\", \"Satta\", \"Pana\" and \"Nama-rupa\", thereby providing the context for the Buddhist \"Anattā\" doctrine. Examples of such \"Attā\" contextual discussions are found in \"Digha Nikaya\" I.186-187, \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.179 and IV.54, \"Vinaya\" I.14, \"Majjhima Nikaya\" I.138, III.19, and III.265–271 and \"Anguttara Nikaya\" I.284.\n\nThe contextual use of \"Attā\" in Nikāyas is two sided. In one, it directly denies that there is anything called a self or soul in a human being that is a permanent essence of a human being, a theme found in Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions. In another, states Peter Harvey, such as at \"Samyutta Nikaya\" IV.286, the Sutta considers the materialistic concept in pre-Buddhist Vedic times of \"no afterlife, complete annihilation\" at death to be a denial of Self, but still \"tied up with belief in a Self\". \"Self exists\" is a false premise, assert the early Buddhist texts. However, adds Peter Harvey, these texts do not admit the premise \"Self does not exist\" either because the wording presumes the concept of \"Self\" prior to denying it; instead, the early Buddhist texts use the concept of \"Anattā\" as the implicit premise. According to Steven Collins, the doctrine of anatta and \"denial of self\" in the canonical Buddhist texts is \"insisted on only in certain theoretical contexts\", while they use the terms \"atta, purisa, puggala\" quite naturally and freely in various contexts. The elaboration of the anatta doctrine, along with identification of the words such as \"puggala\" as \"permanent subject or soul\" appears in later Buddhist literature.\n\n\"Anattā\" is one of the main bedrock doctrines of Buddhism, and its discussion is found in the later texts of all Buddhist traditions. For example, the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (~200 CE), extensively wrote about rejecting the metaphysical entity called \"attā\" or \"ātman\" (self, soul), asserting in chapter 18 of his \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" that there is no such substantial entity and that \"Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self\". The texts attributed to the 5th-century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu of the Yogachara school similarly discuss \"Anatta\" as a fundamental premise of the Buddha. The Vasubandhu interpretations of no-self thesis were challenged by the 7th-century Buddhist scholar Candrakirti, who then offered his own theories on its importance.\n\n\"Anattā\" (no-self, without soul, no essence) is the nature of living beings, and this is one of the three marks of existence in Buddhism, along with \"Anicca\" (impermanence, nothing lasts) and \"Dukkha\" (suffering, unsatisfactoriness is innate in birth, aging, death, rebirth, redeath – the Saṃsāra cycle of existence). It is found in many texts of different Buddhist traditions, such as the \"Dhammapada\" – a canonical Buddhist text. Buddhism asserts with Four Noble Truths that there is a way out of this Saṃsāra.\n\nWhile the concept of soul in Hinduism (as atman) and Jainism (as jiva) is taken for granted, which is different from the Buddhist concept of no-soul, each of the three religions believed in rebirth and emphasized moral responsibility in different ways in contrast to pre-Buddhist materialistic schools of Indian philosophies. The materialistic schools of Indian philosophies, such as Charvaka, are called annihilationist schools because they posited that death is the end, there is no afterlife, no soul, no rebirth, no karma, and death is that state where a living being is completely annihilated, dissolved.\n\nBuddha criticized the materialistic annihilationism view that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown. Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because they encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism. Anatta does not mean there is no afterlife, no rebirth or no fruition of karma, and Buddhism contrasts itself to annihilationist schools. Buddhism also contrasts itself to other Indian religions that champion moral responsibility but posit eternalism with their premise that within each human being there is an essence or eternal soul, and this soul is part of the nature of a living being, existence and metaphysical reality.\n\nThe Buddha emphasized both karma and anatta doctrines.\n\nThe Buddha criticized the doctrine that posited an unchanging soul as a subject as the basis of rebirth and karmic moral responsibility, which he called \"atthikavāda\". He also criticized the materialistic doctrine that denied the existence of both soul and rebirth, and thereby denied karmic moral responsibility, which he calls \"natthikavāda\". Instead, the Buddha asserted that there is no soul, but there is rebirth for which karmic moral responsibility is a must. In the Buddha's framework of karma, right view and right actions are necessary for liberation.\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, while the \"Suttas\" criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self as baseless, they see an enlightened being as one whose empirical self is highly developed. This is paradoxical, states Harvey, in that \"the Self-like \"nibbana\" state\" is a mature self that knows \"everything as Selfless\". The \"empirical self\" is the \"citta\" (mind/heart, mindset, emotional nature), and the development of self in the Suttas is the development of this \"citta\".\n\nOne with \"great self\", state the early Buddhist \"Suttas\", has a mind which is neither at the mercy of outside stimuli nor its own moods, neither scattered nor diffused, but imbued with self-control, and self-contained towards the single goal of \"nibbana\" and a 'Self-like' state. This \"great self\" is not yet an \"Arahat\", because he still does small evil action which leads to karmic fruition, but he has enough virtue that he does not experience this fruition in hell.\n\nAn \"Arahat\", states Harvey, has a fully enlightened state of empirical self, one that lacks the \"sense of both 'I am' and 'this I am'\", which are illusions that the \"Arahat\" has transcended. The Buddhist thought and salvation theory emphasizes a development of self towards a Selfless state not only with respect to oneself, but recognizing the lack of relational essence and Self in others, wherein states Martijn van Zomeren, \"self is an illusion\".\n\nTheravada Buddhism scholars, states Oliver Leaman, consider the \"Anattā\" doctrine as one of the main theses of Buddhism.\n\nThe Buddhist denial of \"any Soul or Self\" is what distinguishes Buddhism from major religions of the world such as Christianity and Hinduism, giving it uniqueness, asserts the Theravada tradition. With the doctrine of \"Anattā\", stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure, asserts Nyanatiloka.\n\nAccording to Collins,\" insight into the teaching of anatta is held to have two major loci in the intellectual and spiritual education of an individual\" as s/he progresses along the Path. The first part of this insight is to avoid \"sakkayaditthi\" (Personality Belief), that is converting the \"sense of I which is gained from introspection and the fact of physical individuality\" into a theoretical belief in a self. 'A belief in a (really) existing body' is considered a false belief and a part of the Ten Fetters that must be gradually lost. The second loci is the psychological realisation of anatta, or loss of 'pride or conceit'. This, states Collins, is explained as the conceit of \"asmimana\" or 'I am'; (...) what this 'conceit' refers to is the fact that for the unenlightened man, all experience and action must necessarily appear phenomenologically as happening to or originating from an 'I'. When a Buddhist gets more enlightened, this happening to or originating in an 'I' or sakkdyaditthi is less. The final attainment of enlightenment is the disappearance of this automatic but illusory 'I'.\n\nThe Theravada tradition has long considered the understanding and application of the \"Anatta\" doctrine to a complex teaching, whose \"personal, introjected application has always been thought to be possible only for the specialist, the practising monk\". The tradition, states Collins, has \"insisted fiercely on anatta as a doctrinal position\", while in practice it may not play much of a role in the daily religious life of most Buddhists. The Suttas present the doctrine in three forms. First, they apply the \"no-self, no-identity\" doctrine to all phenomena as well as any and all objects, yielding the idea that \"all things are not-self\" (\"sabbe dhamma anatta\"). Second, states Collins, the Suttas apply the doctrine to deny self of any person, treating conceit to be evident in any assertion of \"this is mine, this I am, this is myself\" (\"etam mamam eso 'ham asmi, eso me atta ti\"). Third, the Theravada texts apply the doctrine as a nominal reference, to identify examples of \"self\" and \"not-self\", respectively the Wrong view and the Right view; this third case of nominative usage is properly translated as \"self\" (as an identity) and is unrelated to \"soul\", states Collins. The first two usages incorporate the idea of soul. The Theravada doctrine of \"Anatta\", or not-self not-soul, inspire meditative practices for monks, states Donald Swearer, but for the lay Theravada Buddhists in Southeast Asia, the doctrines of \"kamma\", rebirth and \"punna\" (merit) inspire a wide range of ritual practices and ethical behavior.\n\nThe \"Anatta\" doctrine is key to the concept of nirvana (nibbana) in the Theravada tradition. The liberated nirvana state, states Collins, is the state of \"Anatta\", a state that is neither universally applicable nor can be explained, but can be realized.\n\nThe dispute about \"self\" and \"not-self\" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.\nIt is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that \"original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul\", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as \"the principal means to achieving liberation\".\n\nIn Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states Paul Williams, some modern era Buddhist scholars have claimed that \"nirvana is indeed the true Self\", while other Thai Buddhists disagree. For instance, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of \"anatta\" (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the \"true self\" or \"dhammakaya\". The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta, or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in the 1994 by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self\". The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a \"true self\". Similar interpretations on the \"true self\" were put forth earlier by the 12th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the \"tathāgatagarbha\" sutras.\n\nSeveral notable teachers of the Thai Forest Tradition have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. Ajahn Maha Bua, a well known meditation master, described the citta (mind) as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under \"anattā.\" He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well. American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually \"prevent\" enlightenment. \n\nScholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates do not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a \"not-self\" teaching rather than a \"no-self\" teaching.\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta, where the Buddha stays silent when asked whether there is a 'self' or not, as a major cause of the dispute. In Thailand, this dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.\n\nThere are many different views of Anatta (; Japanese: 無我 \"muga\") within various Mahayana schools.\n\nNagarjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka (middle way) school of Mahayana Buddhism, analyzed dharma first as factors of experience. He, states David Kalupahana, analyzed how these experiences relate to \"bondage and freedom, action and consequence\", and thereafter analyzed the notion of personal self (\"attā\", \"ātman\").\n\nNagarjuna asserted that the notion of a self is associated with the notion of one's own identity and corollary ideas of pride, selfishness and a sense of psychophysical personality. This is all false, and leads to bondage in his Madhyamaka thought. There can be no pride nor possessiveness, in someone who accepts \"Anattā\" and denies \"self\" which is the sense of personal identity of oneself, others or anything, states Nagarjuna. Further, all obsessions are avoided when a person accepts emptiness (\"sunyata\"). Nagarjuna denied there is anything called a self-nature as well as other-nature, emphasizing true knowledge to be comprehending emptiness. Anyone who has not dissociated from his belief in personality in himself or others, through the concept of self, is in a state of \"Avidya\" (ignorance) and caught in the cycle of rebirths and redeaths.\n\nThe early Mahayana Buddhism texts link their discussion of \"emptiness\" (\"shunyata\") to \"Anatta\" and \"Nirvana\". They do so, states Mun-Keat Choong, in three ways: first, in the common sense of a monk's meditative state of emptiness; second, with the main sense of \"Anatta\" or 'everything in the world is empty of self'; third, with the ultimate sense of \"Nirvana\" or realization of emptiness and thus an end to rebirth cycles of suffering. The Anatta doctrine is another aspect of \"shunyata\", its realization is the nature of the \"nirvana\" state and to an end to rebirths.\n\nSome 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts suggest concepts that have been controversial because they imply a \"self-like\" concept. In particular are the \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\", where the title itself means a \"garbha\" (womb, matrix, seed) containing \"Tathagata\" (Buddha). These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'. The \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine, at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE. Most scholars consider the \"Tathagatagarbha \" doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self', and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nThe \"Mahayana\" \"Mahaparinirvana Sutra\" explicitly asserts that the Buddha used the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. The \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" (also known as \"Uttaratantra\"), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning \"self-love\" (\"atma-sneha\") – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism. The 6th-century Chinese \"Tathagatagarbha\" translation states that \"Buddha has \"shiwo\" (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing\". However, the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" asserts that the \"Self\" implied in \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is actually \"not-Self\".\n\nAccording to some scholars, the Buddha-nature discussed in these sutras does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language and expression of śūnyatā \"emptiness\" and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. Other scholars do in fact detect leanings towards monism in these tathagatagarbha references. Michael Zimmermann sees the notion of an unperishing and eternal self in the Tathagatagarbha Sutra. Zimmermann also avers that 'the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra'. He further indicates that there is no evident interest found in this sutra in the idea of Emptiness (\"sunyata\"). Williams states that the \"Self\" in \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" is actually \"non-Self\", and neither identical nor comparable to the Hindu concepts of Brahman and Self.\n\nThe Anatta or Anatman doctrine is extensively discussed in and partly inspires the ritual practices of the Vajrayana tradition. The Tibetan terms such as \"bdag med\" refer to \"without a self, insubstantial, anatman\". These discussions, states Jeffrey Hopkins, assert the \"non-existence of a permanent, unitary and independent self\", and attribute these ideas to the Buddha.\n\nThe ritual practices in Vajrayana Buddhism employs the concept of deities, to end self-grasping, and to manifest as a purified, enlightened deity as part of the Vajrayana path to liberation from rebirths. One such deity is goddess Nairatmya (literally, non-soul, non-self). She symbolizes, states Miranda Shaw, that \"self is an illusion\" and \"all beings and phenomenal appearances lack an abiding self or essence\" in Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\nAnatta is a central doctrine of Buddhism. It marks one of the major differences between Buddhism and Hinduism. According to the anatta doctrine of Buddhism, at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is no \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person, amongst other things, realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nThe traditions within Hinduism believe in Atman. The pre-Buddhist Upanishads of Hinduism assert that there is a permanent \"Atman\", and is an ultimate metaphysical reality. This sense of self, is expressed as \"I am\" in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1, states Peter Harvey, when nothing existed before the start of the universe. The Upanishadic scriptures hold that this soul or self is underlying the whole world. At the core of all human beings and living creatures, assert the Hindu traditions, there is \"eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman.\" Within the diverse schools of Hinduism, there are differences of perspective on whether souls are distinct, whether Supreme Soul or God exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, and how to reach moksha. However, despite their internal differences, one shared foundational premise of Hinduism is that \"soul, self exists\", and that there is bliss in seeking this self, knowing self, and self-realization.\n\nBoth Buddhism and Hinduism distinguish ego-related \"I am, this is mine\", from their respective abstract doctrines of \"Anatta\" and \"Atman\". This, states Peter Harvey, may have been an influence of Buddhism on Hinduism.\n\nThe term \"niratman\" appears in the \"Maitrayaniya Upanishad\" of Hinduism, such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. \"Niratman\" literally means \"selfless\". The \"niratman\" concept has been interpreted to be analogous to \"anatman\" of Buddhism. The ontological teachings, however, are different. In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as \"niratman\" and \"sarvasyatman\" (the self of all) – are used in \"Maitrayaniya Upanishad\" to explain the nondual concept of the \"highest Self\". According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the \"niratman\" state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual soul, and reaching the awareness of universal soul or the metaphysical Brahman.\n\n"}

{"id": "1638459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1638459", "title": "Artha", "text": "Artha\n\nArtha (; ) is one of the four aims of human life in Indian philosophy. The word \"artha\" literally translates as \"meaning, sense, goal, purpose or essence\" depending on the context. Artha is also a broader concept in the scriptures of Hinduism. As a concept, it has multiple meanings, all of which imply \"means of life\", activities and resources that enable one to be in a state one wants to be in.\n\nArtha applies to both an individual and a government. In an individual's context, \"artha\" includes wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism. At government level, \"artha\" includes social, legal, economic and worldly affairs. Proper Arthashastra is considered an important and necessary objective of government.\n\nIn Hindu traditions, Artha is connected to the three other aspects and goals of human life: Dharma (virtuous, proper, moral life), Kama (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment) and Moksha (liberation, release, self-actualization). Together, these mutually non-exclusive four aims of life are called Puruṣārtha.\n\nArtha as a concept includes multiple meanings. It is difficult to capture the meaning of artha, or related terms of \"dharma\", \"kama\" and \"moksha\", each in a single English word.\n\nJohn Lochtefeld describes \"artha\" as the means of life, and includes material prosperity. Karl Potter explains it as an attitude and capability that enables one to make a living, to remain alive, to thrive as a free person. It includes economic prosperity, security and health of oneself and those one feels responsible for. Artha includes everything in one's environment that allows one to live. It is neither an end state nor an endless goal of aimlessly amassing money, claims Karl Potter, rather it is an attitude and necessary requirement of human life. John Koller takes a different viewpoint than Karl Potter's interpretation. John Koller suggests artha is not an attitude, rather it is one of the necessities of human life. A central premise of Hindu philosophy, claims Koller, is that every person should live a joyous and pleasurable life, that such fulfilling life requires every person's needs and desires be acknowledged and fulfilled, that needs can only be satisfied through activity and when sufficient means for those activities are available. Artha, then, is best described as pursuit of activities and means necessary for a joyous and pleasurable life.\n\nDaya Krishna argues that \"artha\", as well as the concept of Puruṣārthas, is a myth. The various schools and ancient Sanskrit texts provide no consensus opinion, notes Krishna, rather they present a debate, a diversity of views on what \"artha\" and Puruṣārtha means. Inconsistencies and conflicting verses are even present within the same script, such as the Manusmriti. Some ancient Indian texts suggest artha are instruments that enable satisfaction of desires; some include wealth, some include power, and some such as the bhakti schools include instruments to love God. Some of this, suggests Krishna, reflects differences in human needs. Perhaps, conjectures Krishna, artha is just a subset of kama and karma.\n\nVatsyayana in Kama Sutra defines \"artha\" as the acquisition of arts, land, cattle, wealth, equipages and friends. He explains, artha is also protection of what is already acquired, and the increase of what is protected.\n\nGavin Flood explains artha as \"worldly success\" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), kama (love) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation). Flood clarifies that \"artha\" in ancient Hindu literature, as well as purushartha, is better understood as a goal of Man (not a man). In other words, it is one of the four purposes of human life. The survival and the thriving of humans requires artha - that is, economic activity, wealth and its creation, worldly success, profit, political success and all that is necessary for human existence.\n\nThe word Artha appears in the oldest known scriptures of India. However, the term connotes 'purpose', goal or 'aim' of something, often as purpose of ritual sacrifices. Over time, artha evolves into a broader concept in the Upanishadic era. It is first included as part of \"Trivarga\" concept (three categories of human life - dharma, artha and kama), which over time expanded into the concept \"Caturvarga\" (four categories, including moksha). \"Caturvarga\" is also referred to as Puruṣārtha.\n\nThe Mimamsa school of Hinduism explained artha, dharma and kama by contrasting Puruṣārtha and Kratvartha. Puruṣārtha is human purpose of a yajna, while Kratvartha is sacrificial purpose of a yajna. They recognized and explained all human actions have two effects: first, every act affects itself regardless of actors involved; second, every act has human meanings, hopes and desires and affects each actor in a personal way. Jaimini explained in 3rd century BC, that this human meaning cannot be separated from the human goal. The \"phala\" (fruit, result) of a sacrifice is implicit in the \"artha\" (meaning, purpose) of the sacrifice. Mimamsa school then argued that man is for the purpose of actions demanded by Vedic injunctions (apauruseya), and such subordination of man to rituals allows man to reach heaven. Other schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Vedanta schools, disagreed with Mimamsa school. They argued that rituals and sacrifice are means, not ends. Their emphasis shifted from rituals to effort and knowledge, from heaven to moksha, from freedom after life to freedom in this life, from human being as a cog in cosmic wheel to human being as an end in himself. For example, Aitareya Aranyaka recites:\nThereafter came a flowering of the Shastraic literature on Artha and other aims of human beings: of dharma in Dharmashastras, of artha in Arthashastras, of kama in Kamashastras (Kamasutra being one part of the compendium). Different schools of Hinduism offer different perspectives on artha, just like dharma, karma and moksha. Most historical literature of ancient India from about 5th century BC and after, interlaces all four aims of humans. Many Upanishads as well as the two Indian Epics - the Ramayana and the Mahabharata - discuss and use the words dharma, artha, kama and moksha as part of their respective themes. Even subhasitas, gnomic and didatic Indian literature from 1st and 2nd millennium CE, incorporate artha and other three aims of human life.\n\nAncient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama - profit and pleasure respectively - lead to social chaos. The Gautama Dharmashastra, Apastamba Dharmasutra and Yājñavalkya Smṛti, as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.\n\nVatsyayana, the author of Kamasutra, recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha. Kautiliya's Arthashastra, however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya. Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued.\n\nSome ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kama takes precedence; in youth kama and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence.\n\nThe Epics such as the Mahabharata debate the relative precedence of dharma, artha, kama and moksha, through the different characters in Book 12, the Book of Peace. Rishi Vidura says dharma must take the highest precedence. Arjuna claims without profit and prosperity (artha), people's ability for dharma and kama fall apart. Bhima claims pleasure and sex (kama) come first, because without these there is no dharma, artha or moksha. Yudhishthira asserts dharma should always lead one, including in matters of artha and kama, but then admits balancing dharma, artha and kama is often confusing and difficult. In another book, the Mahabharata suggests that morality, profit and pleasure - dharma, artha and kama - all three must go together for happiness:\nGavin Flood suggests the concepts embedded in purushartha, which includes artha, reflect a deep understanding and insights into human nature, and of conflicts which are inevitably faced by all human beings. It is an attempt to acknowledge and encourage one to understand diversity yet seek coherence between people, rather than deny one or more aspects of human life or force a particular precept and code on people.\n\nDonald Davis suggests that \"artha\", \"kama\" and \"dharma\" are broadly applicable human aims, that extend beyond Hindu studies. They are Indian perspective on the nature of human life, a perspective shared in Jain and Buddhist literature.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4305749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4305749", "title": "Bestiarii", "text": "Bestiarii\n\nAmong Ancient Romans, bestiarii (singular bestiarius) were those who went into combat with beasts, or were exposed to them. It is conventional to distinguish two categories of \"bestiarii\": the first were those condemned to death via the beasts (see \"damnatio ad bestias\") and the second were those who faced them voluntarily, for pay or glory (see \"venatio\"). The latter are sometimes erroneously called \"gladiators\"; to their contemporaries, however, the term \"gladiator\" referred specifically to one who fought other men. The contemporary term for those who made a career out of participating in arena \"hunts\" was venatores.\n\nAs a means of torturous capital punishment, death by wild beasts was a punishment for enemies of the state, a category which included those taken prisoner and slaves found guilty of a serious crime. These were sent to their deaths naked and unable to defend themselves against the beasts. Even if they succeeded in killing one, fresh animals were continually let loose on them, until the \"bestiarii\" were all dead. It is reported that it was seldom necessary for two beasts to be required to take down one man. On the contrary, one beast frequently dispatched several men. Cicero mentions a single lion which alone dispatched 200 \"bestiarii\".\n\n\"Bestiarii\", as reported by Seneca, consisted of young men who, to become expert in managing their arms, fought sometimes against beasts, and sometimes against one another; and of bravos who, to show their courage and dexterity, exposed themselves to this dangerous combat. Augustus encouraged this practice in young men of the first rank; Nero exposed himself to it; and it was for killing beasts in the amphitheatre that Commodus acquired the title of the Roman Hercules.\n\nVigenère adds two more types of \"bestiarii\": the first were those who made a trade of it, and fought for money. It appears that there were schools in Rome, in which people were trained to fight wild beasts (\"scholae bestiarum\", or \"bestiariorum\"). The second type was where several armed \"bestiarii\" were let loose at once against a number of beasts.\n"}
{"id": "42607899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42607899", "title": "Cases of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union", "text": "Cases of political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union\n\nIn the Soviet Union, a systematic political abuse of psychiatry took place and was based on the interpretation of political dissent as a psychiatric problem. It was called \"psychopathological mechanisms\" of dissent.\n\nDuring the leadership of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, psychiatry was used as a tool to eliminate political opponents (\"dissidents\") who openly expressed beliefs that contradicted official dogma. The term \"philosophical intoxication\" was widely used to diagnose mental disorders in cases where people disagreed with leaders and made them the target of criticism that used the writings by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. Article 58-10 of the Stalin Criminal Code—which as Article 70 had been shifted into the RSFSR Criminal Code of 1962—and Article 190-1 of the RSFSR Criminal Code along with the system of diagnosing mental illness, developed by academician Andrei Snezhnevsky, created the very preconditions under which non-standard beliefs could easily be transformed into a criminal case, and it, in its turn, into a psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-Soviet political behavior, in particular, being outspoken in opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, writing books were defined in some persons as being simultaneously a criminal act (e.g., violation of Articles 70 or 190-1), a symptom (e.g., \"delusion of reformism\"), and a diagnosis (e.g., \"sluggish schizophrenia\"). Within the boundaries of the diagnostic category, the symptoms of pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of \"sluggish schizophrenia.\"\n\nThe process of psychiatric incarceration was instigated by attempts to emigrate; distribution or possession of prohibited documents or books; participation in civil rights actions and demonstrations, and involvement in forbidden religious activity. The religious faith of prisoners, including well-educated former atheists who adopted a religion, was determined to be a form of mental illness that needed to be cured. The KGB routinely sent dissenters to psychiatrists for diagnosing to avoid embarrassing publiс trials and to discredit dissidence as the product of ill minds. Formerly highly classified government documents published after the dissolution of the Soviet Union demonstrate that the authorities used psychiatry as a tool to suppress dissent.\n\nAccording to the \"Commentary on the Russian Federation Law on Psychiatric Care\", persons who were subjected to repressions in the form of commitment for compulsory treatment to psychiatric medical institutions and were rehabilitated in accordance with the established procedure receive compensation. The Russian Federation acknowledged that psychiatry was used for political purposes and took responsibility for the victims of \"political psychiatry.\"\n\nPolitical abuse of psychiatry in Russia continues after the fall of the Soviet Union and threatens human rights activists with a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nPolitical abuse of psychiatry is the misuse of psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment for the purposes of obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society. It entails the exculpation and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria. Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms \"Soviet political psychiatry\" or \"punitive psychiatry\" to refer to this phenomenon.\n\nIn the book \"Punitive Medicine\" by Alexander Podrabinek, the term \"punitive medicine\", which is identified with \"punitive psychiatry,\" is defined as \"a tool in the struggle against dissidents who cannot be punished by legal means.\" Punitive psychiatry is neither a discrete subject nor a psychiatric specialty but, rather, it is an emergency arising within many applied sciences in totalitarian countries where members of a profession may feel themselves compelled to service the diktats of power. Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression and Soviet punitive psychiatry was one of the key weapons of both illegal and legal repression.\n\nAs Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman wrote in their joint \"A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissenters\", \"the Soviet use of psychiatry as a punitive means is based upon the deliberate interpretation of dissent… as a psychiatric problem.\" This work was published in Russian, English, French, Italian, German, Danish.\n\nPsychiatry possesses an inherent capacity for abuse that is greater than in other areas of medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of the detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials. In the period from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to have been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times coded threats to authority as mental disease during periods of political disturbance and instability. Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.\n\nIn the Soviet Union dissidents were often confined in the so-called \"psikhushka\", or psychiatric wards. \"Psikhushka\" is the Russian ironic diminutive for \"mental hospital\". One of the first \"psikhushkas\" was the Psychiatric Prison Hospital in the city of Kazan. In 1939 it was transferred to the control of the NKVD, the secret police and the precursor organization to the KGB, under the order of Lavrentiy Beria, who was the head of the NKVD. International human rights defenders such as Walter Reich have long recorded the methods by which Soviet psychiatrists in \"Psikhushka\" hospitals diagnosed schizophrenia in political dissenters. Western scholars examined no aspect of Soviet psychiatry as thoroughly as its involvement in the social control of political dissenters.\n\nCases of political abuse of psychiatry have been known since the 1940s and 1950s. One of these early cases was that of party official Sergei Pisarev. Pisarev was arrested after criticizing the work of the Soviet secret police in the context of the so-called Doctors' Plot, an anti-Semitic campaign waged at Stalin's instructions that should have brought about a new terror wave in the Soviet Union and possibly the extermination of the remaining Jewish communes that had outlived the Second World War. Pisarev was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad which along with an analogous hospital in Sychevka has started functioning since the Second World War. After his discharge, Pisarev began a campaign against political abuse of psychiatry, concentrating on the Serbsky Institute which he viewed to be the seat of the trouble. As a consequence of his efforts, the Central Committee of the Communist Party formed a committee which investigated the situation and came to the conclusion that political abuse of psychiatry was actually taking place. The report, however, vanished in a desk drawer and never brought about any action.\n\nIn 1961, Soviet general Pyotr Grigorenko started to openly criticize what he considered the excesses of the Khrushchev regime. He maintained that the special privileges of the political elite did not comply with the principles laid down by Lenin. Grigorenko formed a dissident group — The Group for the Struggle to Revive Leninism. Soviet psychiatrists from commissions instituted to inquire into his sanity diagnosed him at least three times — in April 1964, August 1969, and November 1969. When arrested, Grigorenko was sent to Moscow's Lubyanka prison, and from there for psychiatric examination to the Serbsky Institute where the first commission, which included Snezhnevsky and Lunts, diagnosed him as suffering from the mental disease in the form of a paranoid delusional development of his personality, accompanied by early signs of cerebral arteriosclerosis. Lunts, reporting later on this diagnosis, mentioned that the symptoms of paranoid development were \"an overestimation of his own personality reaching messianic proportions\" and \"reformist ideas.\" Grigorenko was irresponsible for his actions and was thereby forcibly committed to a special psychiatric hospital. While there, the government deprived him of his pension despite the fact that, by law, a mentally sick military officer was entitled to a pension. After six months, Grigorenko was found to be in remission and was released for outpatient follow-up. He required that his pension be restored. Although he began to draw pension again, it was severely cut. He became much more active in his dissidence, stirred other people to protest some of the State's actions and received several warnings from the KGB. As Grigorenko had followers in Moscow, he was lured to Tashkent, half a continent away. Again he was arrested and examined by psychiatric team. None of the manifestations or symptoms cited by the Lunts commission were found by the second commission held in Tashkent under the chairmanship of Fyodor Detengof. The diagnosis and evaluation made by the commission was that \"Grigorenko's [criminal] activity had a purposeful character, it was related to concrete events and facts... It did not reveal any signs of illness or delusions.\" The psychiatrists reported that he was not mentally sick, but responsible for his actions. He had firm convictions which were shared by many of his colleagues and were not delusional. Having evaluated the records of his preceding hospitalization, they concluded that he had not been sick at that time either. The KGB brought Grigorenko back in Moscow and, three months later, arranged a second examination at the Serbsky Institute. Once again, these psychiatrists found that he had \"a paranoid development of the personality\" manifested by reformist ideas. The commission, which included Lunts and was chaired by Morozov, recommended that he be recommitted to a special psychiatric hospital for the socially dangerous. Eventually, after almost four years, he was transferred to a usual mental hospital.\n\nIn 1971, Dr. Semyon Gluzman wrote a psychiatric report on Grigorenko. Gluzman came to the conclusion that Grigorenko was mentally sane and had been taken to mental hospitals for political reasons. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Gluzman was forced to serve seven years in labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for refusing to diagnose Grigorenko with a mental illness.\n\nAndrew, Grigorenko's son, was declared a hereditary madman in 1975 and was expelled from the USSR to the USA where he lives now. Andrew was repeatedly told that since his father was mentally ill, then he was hereditarily mentally ill as well, and if he would not stop his appearances in defense of human rights and his father, he was told to go to psikhushka.\n\nIn 1979 in New York, Grigorenko was examined by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists including Alan A. Stone, the then President of American Psychiatric Association. The team came to the conclusion that they could find no evidence of mental disease in Grigorenko and his history consistent with mental disease in the past. The conclusion was drawn up by Walter Reich. Stone said Grigorenko's case confirms some of the accusations that psychiatry in the Soviet Union is sometimes employed as a tool of political repression. In 1981, Pyotr Grigorenko told about his psychiatric examinations and hospitalizations in his memoirs \"V Podpolye Mozhno Vstretit Tolko Krys\" (\"In The Underground One Can Meet Only Rats\") translated into English under the title \"Memoirs\" in 1982. In 1991, a commission, composed of psychiatrists from all over the Soviet Union and led by Modest Kabanov, director of the Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute in St Petersburg, spent six months reviewing the Grigorenko files, drew up 29 thick volumes of legal proceedings, and reversed the official diagnosis on Grigorenko in October 1991. In 1992, the official post-mortem forensic psychiatric commission of experts met at Grigorenko's homeland removed the stigma of mental patient from him and confirmed that the debilitating treatment he underwent in high security psychiatric hospitals for many years was groundless. The 1992 psychiatric examination of Grigorenko was described by the \"Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal\" in its numbers 1–4 of 1992.\n\nViktor Rafalsky, a political prisoner, dissident and author of unpublished plays, novels, and short stories, was committed to Soviet psychiatric prisons in Lviv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Leningrad for 24 years because of belonging to a clandestine Marxist group (from 1954 to 1959), writing anti-Soviet prose (from 1962 to 1965), and possessing anti-Soviet literature (from 1968 to 1983). In the winter of 1987, he was discharged and pronounced sane. In 1988, Viktor Rafalsky published the first version of his memoirs \"Reportazh iz Niotkuda\" (\"Reportage from Nowhere\") describing his confinement in Soviet psychiatric hospitals. In his memoirs, he writes, \"I will say plain: when I got into a prison (it happened quite often), I, whether you believe or not, had a rest. So what was a prison in comparison with the horror of prison psikhushkas?!\" Some pages below, he adds, \"In a prison, you can read, write, lastly do something to kill time. In prison psikhushkas, you have the right only to look at the ceiling: it is forbidden to keep paper, pencils, and even a book.\"\n\nAt the very end of 1963, the poet Joseph Brodsky was committed for observation to the Kashchenko psychiatric clinic in Moscow where he stayed for several days. A few weeks later, his second hospitalization took place: on 13 February he was arrested in Leningrad. Brought to trial for \"pursuing a parasitic way of life\", Brodsky was accused of being a poet and of not doing more \"productive\" work. There were two hearings of the trial dated 18 February and 13 March 1964. The judge ordered to send him \"for an official psychiatric examination during which it will be determined whether Brodsky is suffering from some sort of psychological illness or not and whether this illness will prevent Brodsky from being sent to a distant locality for forced labor. Taking into consideration that from the history of his illness it is apparent that Brodsky has evaded hospitalization, it is hereby ordered that division No. 18 of the militia be in charge of bringing him to the official psychiatric examination.\" On 18 February, the Dzerzhinsky District Court sent Brodsky for psychiatric examination to \"Pryazhka,\" Psychiatric Hospital No. 2 where he spent about three weeks, from 18 February to 13 March. In the mental hospitals, Brodsky was given \"tranquilizing\" injections, wakened in the middle of the night, immersed into a cold bath, wrapped in a wet sheet, and put next to the heater so that the sheet would cut into his body when it dried. These two stints at psychiatric establishments formed the experience underlying \"Gorbunov and Gorchakov\" written and called by Brodsky \"an extremely serious work.\" In 1972, when the authorities considered Brodsky for exile and sought an expert opinion on his mental health, they consulted Snezhnevsky who, without examining him personally, diagnosed him as schizophrenic and concluded that he was \"not valuable person at all and may be let go.\"\n\nIn 1965 in the West, strong public awareness that Soviet psychiatry could be subject to political abuse arose with publication of the book \"Ward 7\" by Valery Tarsis, a writer born in 1906 in Kiev. He based the book upon his own experiences in 1963–1964 when he was detained in the Moscow Kashchenko psychiatric hospital for political reasons.\n\nThe fictionalised documentary\" Ward No. 7\" by Tarsis was the first literary work to deal with the Soviet authorities' abuse of psychiatry. In a parallel with the story \"Ward No. 6\" by Anton Chekhov, Tarsis implies that it is the doctors who are mad, whereas the patients are completely sane, although unsuited to a life of slavery. Individuals in ward No. 7 are not cured, but persistently maimed; the hospital is a jail and the doctors are gaolers and police spies. Most doctors know nothing about psychiatry, but make diagnoses arbitrarily and give all patients the same medication — an algogenic injection or the anti-psychotic drug Aminazin known in the USA under trade name Thorazine. Tarsis denounces Soviet psychiatry as pseudo-science and charlatanism and writes that, firstly, it has pretenses of curing the sickness of men's souls, but denies the existence of the soul; secondly, since there is no satisfactory definition of mental health, there can be no acceptable definition of mental disease in Soviet society.\n\nIn 1966, Tarsis was permitted to emigrate to the West, and was soon deprived of his Soviet citizenship. The KGB had plans to compromise the literary career of Tarsis abroad through labelling him as a mentally ill person. As the 1966 memorandum to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union reported, \"KGB continues arrangements for further compromising Tarsis abroad as a mentally ill person.\" Among all the victims of Soviet psychiatry, Tarsis was the sole exception in the sense that he did not emphasised the 'injustice' of confining 'sane dissidents' to psychiatric hospitals and did not thereby imply that the psychiatric confinement of 'insane patients' was proper and just.\n\nShortly after publishing \"Ward 7\", a second case of political abuse of psychiatry gave rise to attention in Great Britain. Evgeni Belov, a young Moscow interpreter contracted by a group of four British students, made friends with them. At first he was positive about Soviet system, but gradually became more critical and began to voice demand for more freedom. Calling for a free press and free trade unions, Belov began to write letters to the Party. As a consequence, his membership in the Party was suspended and he was summoned to appear before a committee. He declined, and instead sought justice higher up by writing protest letters to Leonid Brezhnev himself. When British students returned from a short trip to Tokyo, Belov had vanished. To their shock, it emerged that he had been committed to a mental hospital. A campaign to get him out yielded no results. A British newspaper published a letter in which Belov's father stated that his son was really sick, and the campaign came to a grinding halt. However, the public interest had been activated.\n\nAwareness in the West was also raised by the case of Alexander Esenin-Volpin, a son of the famous Russian poet Sergei Esenin and born in 1924. In 1946, he was first committed to the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital for writing a poem considered anti-Soviet. During Khrushchev's reign, Esenin-Volpin was later hospitalized three times: in 1957, in 1959–1960 in the same the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital and, finally, in 1962–1963. In 1968, Esenin-Volpin was again hospitalized, and for this once his case achieved the attention in the West. In February 1968, 99 Soviet mathematicians and scientists signed a protest letter to the Soviet officials demanding his release. After a wave of protests, he was discharged and permitted to immigrate to the USA where he obtained the position of professor of mathematics. In 2010, Alexander Magalif, who hospitalized Esenin-Volpin, recollected that he had seen a little mark made by a pencil in the corner of the referral to treatment of Esenin-Volpin: \"not to discharge from the hospital without coordination with KGB.\"\n\nIn 1965, the writer Yuli Daniel was arrested due to his satirical anti-Stalinist works and outspoken protest at the human rights abuse in the USSR. Daniel was kept in a mental hospital of the Gulag where he was refused medical treatment in order to destroy his will.\n\nViktor Fainberg was one of the seven participants of the 1968 Red Square demonstration against the Soviet intervention into Czechoslovakia. He was committed for compulsory treatment to the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad where he was confined for five years. During his confinement, a psychiatrist working in the establishment, Marina Voikhanskaya, fell in love with him and helped him as much as she could. After his discharge, they married and emigrated to the United Kingdom where Fainberg organized the Campaign Against Psychiatric Abuse and was its director. When Fainberg and Voikhanskaya had divorced, Viktor moved to Paris and Marina remained in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1968, Valeriya Novodvorskaya created an underground student organization whose purpose was to overthrow the Soviet state. On 5 December 1969, she was arrested in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses, where before the start of a performance of the opera \"October\" she was handing out and scattering leaflets written in verse form until she was approached by KGB men. She was later sentenced to indefinite detention in the prison psychiatric hospital in Kazan. Her experience in this hospital was described in her largest collection of writings entitled \"Po Tu Storonu Otchayaniya\" (\"Beyond Despair\"). Novodvorskaya was also committed in a mental hospital later, in 1978 as a member of the Free Interprofessional Association of Workers and as a person arrested \"for insulting President\" in September 1990; that time she was discharged after the 1991 putsch. In the early 1990s, psychiatrists of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia and G. N. Sotsevich proved the absence of mental illness in Novodvorskaya.\n\nAfter the 1968 Red Square demonstration against the Soviet invasion into Czechoslovakia, August 1968 saw the arrest of Natalya Gorbanevskaya well known in the West due to her book \"Red Square at Noon\" describing the demonstration. A few days later, the Serbsky Institute found her non-accountable and made diagnosis of \"deep psychopathy—the presence of mild, chronic schizophrenic process cannot be excluded.\" She was allowed to return to the care of her mother. In November 1969, a psychiatric commission again examined her, diagnosed \"psychopathic personality with symptoms of hysteria and a tendency to decompensation\", but considered that psychiatric hospitalization was not required. A month later, she was again arrested and sent to the Serbsky Institute for psychiatric examination in April 1970. The investigating commission chaired by Morozov found her non-responsible and suffering from \"chronic, mental illness in the form of schizophrenia.\" The commission found in her the presence of changes in the thinking processes and in the critical and emotional faculties characteristic of schizophrenia. It was concluded that Gorbanevskaya took part in the Red Square demonstration in a state of the mental disease. In Paris, French psychiatrists at their request examined Gorbanevskaya and found her to be mentally normal. They concluded that in 1969–1972 she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital for political, not medical reasons.\n\nOn 29 May 1970, Zhores Medvedev, an internationally respected and prominent scientist, was forcibly taken from his apartment in Obninsk and committed to a mental hospital where he was held, without legitimate medical justification, until 17 June 1970. The leadership was instantly faced with the action of strong collective protest initiated by top Soviet scientists including Igor Tamm and Pyotr Kapitsa. Medvedev's release was achieved only after intense pressure from intellectuals and scientists both within and outside of the USSR. He was largely hospitalized because of the publication abroad of his book of Trofim Lysenko. In widely circulated books, Zhores Medvedev had criticized the \"geneticist\" Lysenko and had also expressed his straightforward disagreement with restrictions on communication with scientists abroad. He was removed from his position as head of a laboratory at the Institute of Medical Radiology and this removal was illegal, he said. The diagnosis in the case-notes was \"incipient schizophrenia,\" the diagnosis made by the psychiatric commission was \"psychopathic personality with paranoid tendencies.\" What happened to Medvedev was not a separate incident; rather, it was part, in Medvedev's words, of \"the dangerous tendency of using psychiatry for political purposes, the exploitation of medicine in an alien role as a means of intimidation and punishment — a new and illegal way of isolating people for their views and convictions.\" This experience was reflected in Zhores Medvedev's and Roy Medvedev's book \"A Question of Madness: Repression by Psychiatry in the Soviet Union\" published by Macmillan in London in 1971.\n\nIn 1971, renowned Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov supported a protest of two political prisoners, V. Fainberg and V. Borisov, who announced a hunger strike against \"compulsory therapeutic treatment with medications injurious to mental activity\" in a Leningrad psychiatric institution. In 1984, after publishing an article by Andrei Sakharov in the United States urging a buildup of nuclear weapons in the West, Soviet officials declared him \"a talented, but sick man.\" When sent into internal exile to Gorky \"for his own peace of mind,\" according to officials, \"Soviet medics are taking all necessary measures to restore his health.\" One day in a selected auditorium, when discussing the situation in the country, Snezhnevsky, in the words of some of his clinical staff, diagnosed Sakharov with sluggish schizophrenia in absentia. The director of KGB political police department (Fifth Directorate) Philipp Bobkov concluded, \"Sakharov is objectively a mentally ill person. The complication with regards to operational consequences lies in the fact that for political reasons he cannot be committed to a psychiatric hospital.\" Soviet authorities compulsorily committed Sakharov to a closed ward of the Semashko Hospital in Gorky, where he was force-fed and given drugs to change the state of his mind.\n\nViktor Nekipelov, a well-known dissident poet, was arrested in 1973, sent to the Section 4 of the Serbsky Institute of Forensic Psychiatry for psychiatric evaluation, which lasted from 15 January to 12 March 1974, was judged sane (which he was), tried, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. In 1976, he published in samizdat his book \"Institute of Fools: Notes on the Serbsky Institute\" based on his personal experience at Psychiatric Hospital of the Serbsky Institute and translated into English in 1980. In this account, he wrote compassionately, engagingly, and observantly of the doctors and other patients; most of the latters were ordinary criminals feigning insanity in order to be sent to a mental hospital, because hospital was a \"cushy number\" as against prison camps. According to the President of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, Nekipelov's book is a highly dramatic humane document, a fair story about the nest of Soviet punitive psychiatry, a mirror that psychiatrists always need to look into. However, according to Malcolm Lader, this book as an indictment of the Serbsky Institute hardly rises above tittle-tattle and gossip, and Nekipelov destroys his own credibility by presenting no real evidence but invariably putting the most sinister connotation on events. After publishing his book, he was sentenced to the maximum punishment for \"anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda\" of seven years in a labor camp and then five years in internal exile.\n\nIn 1968, the human rights movement in the USSR focused directly on Soviet political psychiatry, organizing public protests and writing international bodies. In 1969, a group of about 14 activists including Sergei Kovalyov, a future Russian human rights ombudsman, constituted the Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR. The group composed the first \"samizdat\" (self-published) human rights bulletin, \"A Chronicle of Current Events\". Among the members of the Action Group were individuals who subsequently fell victim to psychiatric abuse themselves: the poet Natalya Gorbanevskaya who in 1968 demonstrated on Red Square against bringing Soviet tanks into Czechoslovakia; Vladimir Borisov who later was one of the founders of the independent labor movement in the Soviet Union; Vladimir Maltsev, a translator; and Leonid Plyushch, a Ukrainian cyberneticist who was committed to the Special Psychiatric Hospital of Dnepropetrovsk and was awfully tortured with neuroleptics. Later three senior Fellows of the Royal College of Psychiatrists examined Leonid Plyushch and \"saw no indication of schizophrenia or other mental illness.\"\n\nIn November 1977, a group of unemployed and workers led by Vladimir Klebanov, a former coalminer from the Donbas region of the Ukraine, announced the formation in the Soviet Union of the Association of Free Trade Unions of Workers (AFTU) whose purposes were to meet obligations achieved by collective bargaining; to induce workers and other employees to join free trade union associations; to implement those decisions of the Association which concern the seeking of justice and the defense of rights; to educate Association members in the spirit of irreconcilability toward wastefulness, inefficiency, deception, bureaucracy, deficiencies, and a negligent attitude toward national wealth. These purposes show that AFTU was in all respects an organization whose right to exist is guaranteed by the international obligations of the Soviet Union. On 19 December 1977, Klebanov along with two other workers in Donetsk was arrested by the Soviet militia and released nine days later, after international protests against his incarceration. Worker Gavriil Yankov was incarcerated in Moscow mental hospital for two weeks. On 1 February 1978, AFTU publicly announced the institution of its organizational Charter. Several days later, Klebanov was again detained by Soviet police and sent from Moscow to psychiatric prison hospital in Donetsk. Group member Nikolaev and workers Pelekh and Dvoretsky were also placed under psychiatric detention.\n\nBy October 1978 it was apparent that arrests and repressions had resulted in the dissolution of AFTU. But the cause of trade union rights was to be invigorated by a new group, the Free Interprofessional Association of Workers known by its Russian acronym, SMOT, whose first press conference was held in Moscow on 28 October 1978. The objectives of SMOT were to defend its members in cases of violation of their rights in different spheres of their daily activities: political, domestic, religious, spiritual, cultural, social, and economic; to look into the legal basis of the workers' complaints; to ensure that these complains were brought to the notice of relevant organizations; to facilitate a quick solution to complaints of workers; and in cases of negative results, to publicize them widely before international and Soviet public. The leadership of SMOT was headed by a native of Leningrad electrician Vladimir Borisov incarcerated in Soviet mental hospitals because of his human rights activism for a total of nine years in the 1960s and 1970s.

It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many mathematical proofs depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says or , the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as division and subtraction, that do not have it (for example, ); such operations are \"not\" commutative, and so are referred to as \"noncommutative operations\". The idea that simple operations such as the multiplication and addition of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized. A corresponding property exists for binary relations; a binary relation is said to be symmetric if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, equality is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.\n\nThe \"commutative property\" (or \"commutative law\") is a property generally associated with binary operations and functions. If the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to \"commute\" under that operation.\n\nThe term \"commutative\" is used in several related senses.\n\n\nTwo well-known examples of commutative binary operations:\n\n\nSome noncommutative binary operations:\n\nSubtraction is noncommutative, since formula_3.\n\nDivision is noncommutative, since formula_4.\n\nSome truth functions are noncommutative, since the truth tables for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands. For example, the truth tables for \"f\" (A, B) A Λ ¬B (A AND NOT B) and \"f\" (B, A) B Λ ¬A are\n\nFor the eight noncommutative functions, B\"qp\" = C\"pq\"; M\"qp\" = L\"pq\"; C\"qp\" = B\"pq\"; L\"qp\" = M\"pq\"; F\"qp\" = G\"pq\"; I\"qp\" = H\"pq\"; G\"qp\" = F\"pq\"; H\"qp\" = I\"pq\".\n\nMatrix multiplication is almost always noncommutative, for example:\n\nThe vector product (or cross product) of two vectors in three dimensions is anti-commutative; i.e., \"b\" × \"a\" = −(\"a\" × \"b\").\n\nRecords of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times. The Egyptians used the commutative property of multiplication to simplify computing products. Euclid is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book \"Elements\". Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions. Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term \"commutative\" was in a memoir by François Servois in 1814, which used the word \"commutatives\" when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. The word is a combination of the French word \"commuter\" meaning \"to substitute or switch\" and the suffix \"-ative\" meaning \"tending to\" so the word literally means \"tending to substitute or switch.\" The term then appeared in English in 1838 in Duncan Farquharson Gregory's article entitled \"On the real nature of symbolical algebra\" published in 1840 in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nIn truth-functional propositional logic, \"commutation\", or \"commutativity\" refer to two valid rules of replacement. The rules allow one to transpose propositional variables within logical expressions in logical proofs. The rules are:\n\nand \n\nwhere \"formula_8\" is a metalogical symbol representing \"can be replaced in a proof with.\"\n\n\"Commutativity\" is a property of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic. The following logical equivalences demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional tautologies.\n\n\nIn group and set theory, many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property. In higher branches of mathematics, such as analysis and linear algebra the commutativity of well-known operations (such as addition and multiplication on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.\n\n\nThe associative property is closely related to the commutative property. The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms doesn't change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.\n\nMost commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function\n\nwhich is clearly commutative (interchanging \"x\" and \"y\" does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, formula_14 but formula_15).\nMore such examples may be found in commutative non-associative magmas.\n\nSome forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity. When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line \"y = x\". As an example, if we let a function \"f\" represent addition (a commutative operation) so that \"f\"(\"x\",\"y\") = \"x\" + \"y\" then \"f\" is a symmetric function, which can be seen in the adjacent image.\n\nFor relations, a symmetric relation is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation \"R\" is symmetric, then formula_16.\n\nIn quantum mechanics as formulated by Schrödinger, physical variables are represented by linear operators such as \"x\" (meaning multiply by \"x\"), and formula_17. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their compositions formula_18 and formula_19 (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional wave function formula_20:\n\nAccording to the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg, if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually complementary, which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear momentum in the \"x\"-direction of a particle are represented by the operators formula_22 and formula_23, respectively (where formula_24 is the reduced Planck constant). This is the same example except for the constant formula_25, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "149902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149902", "title": "Composite video", "text": "Composite video\n\nComposite video is an analog video transmission that carries standard definition video typically at 480i or 576i resolution as a single channel. Video information is encoded on one channel, unlike the higher-quality S-video (two channels) and the even higher-quality component video (three or more channels). In all of these video formats, audio is carried on a separate connection. \n\nComposite video is also known by the initials CVBS for composite video baseband signal or color, video, blanking and sync, or is simply referred to as \"SD video\" for the standard-definition television signal it conveys.\n\nThere are three dominant variants of composite video: NTSC, PAL, and SECAM.\n\nA composite video signal combines, on one wire, the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and frame synchronization pulses. The color video signal is a linear combination of the \"luminance\" of the picture and a modulated subcarrier which carries the \"chrominance\" or color information, a combination of hue and saturation. Details of the combining process vary between the NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems.\n\nThe frequency spectrum of the modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies on the fact that frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near harmonics of the horizontal scanning rate, while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband luma signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. In other words, the combination of luma and chroma is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical frequency-division multiplexing systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.\n\nA gated and filtered signal derived from the color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, is added to the horizontal blanking interval of each line, excluding the vertical sync interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the chrominance signals. The burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference subcarrier.\n\nComposite video can easily be directed to any broadcast channel simply by modulating the proper RF carrier wave with it. Most home analog video equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: LaserDiscs store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including VHS and Betamax) and lesser commercial and industrial tape formats (including U-Matic) use modified composite signals (generally known as \"color-under\"). On playback, these devices often give the user the option to output the baseband signal or to modulate it onto a VHF or UHF frequency compatible with a TV tuner (i.e., appearing on a selected TV channel). The professional television production uncompressed digital video videocassette format known as D-2 directly records and reproduces standard NTSC composite video signals, using PCM encoding of the analog signal on the magnetic tape.\n\nIn home applications, the composite video signal is typically connected using an RCA connector (phono plug), normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white (or black) connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. BNC connectors and higher quality coaxial cable are often used in professional television studios and post-production applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home VCRs, often accompanied by either phono connectors or a 5-pin DIN connector for audio. The BNC connector, in turn post dated the PL-259 connector which featured on first generation VCRs.\n\nIn Europe, SCART connections are often used instead of RCA jacks (and to a lesser extent, S-Video), so where available, RGB is used instead of composite video with computers, video game consoles, and DVD players.\n\nVideo cables are 75 ohm impedance, low in capacitance. Typical values run from 52 pF/m for an HDPE-foamed dielectric precision video cable to 69 pF/m for a solid PE dielectric cable.\n\nSome devices that connect to a TV, such as VCRs, older video game consoles and home computers of the 1980s, output a composite signal. This may then be converted to RF with an external box known as an RF modulator that generates the proper carrier (often for channel 3 or 4 in North America, channel 36 in Europe). Sometimes this modulator was built into the product (such as video game consoles, VCRs, or the Atari, Commodore 64, or TRS-80 CoCo home-computers) and sometimes it was an external unit powered by the computer (in the case of the TI-99/4A or some Apple modulators) or with an independent power supply. In the United States, using an external RF modulator frees the manufacturer from obtaining FCC approval for each variation of a device. Through the early 1980s, electronics that output a television channel signal were required to meet the same shielding requirements as broadcast television equipment, thus forcing manufacturers such as Apple to omit an RF modulator, and Texas Instruments to have their RF modulator as an external unit, which they had certified by the FCC without mentioning they were planning to sell it with a computer. In Europe, while most countries used the same broadcast standard, there were different modulation standards (PAL-G versus PAL-I, for example), and using an external modulator allowed manufacturers to make a single product and easily sell it to different countries by changing the modulator. Video game consoles on the other hand were less of an issue with FCC approval because the circuitry was inexpensive enough to allow for channel 3/4 outputs.\n\nModern day devices with analog outputs have typically omitted channel 3 and 4 outputs in favor of composite and S-video outputs (or have switched to using HDMI or other digital formats) as composite and S-video have become more common as inputs for TVs. In addition, many TV sets sold these days no longer have analog television tuners and cannot accept channel 3/4. But because composite video has a well-established market for both devices that convert it to channel 3/4 outputs, as well as devices that convert things like VGA to composite, it has offered opportunities to repurpose older composite monitors for newer devices.\n\nThe process of modulating RF with the original video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces several losses. This conversion also typically adds noise or interference to the signal as well. For these reasons, it is typically best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible. Almost all modern video equipment has at least composite connectors, so this typically is not a problem; however, older video equipment and some very low-end modern televisions have only RF input (essentially the antenna jack); while RF modulators are no longer common, they are still available to translate baseband signals for older equipment.\n\nHowever, just as the modulation and demodulation of RF loses quality, the mixing of the various signals into the original composite signal does the same, causing a checkerboard video artifact known as dot crawl. Dot crawl is a defect that results from crosstalk due to the intermodulation of the chrominance and luminance components of the signal. This is usually seen when chrominance is transmitted with a high bandwidth, and its spectrum reaches into the band of the luminance frequencies. This has led to a proliferation of systems such as S-Video and component video to maintain the signals separately. Comb filters are also commonly used to separate signals, and eliminate artifacts, from composite sources.\nWhen used for connecting a video source to a video display that supports both 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, the PAL and NTSC television standards provide for signaling pulses that will automatically switch the display from one format to the other. This is called widescreen signalling (WSS).\n\nSince TV screens hide the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal and even crop the edges of the picture, extensions have been implemented by taking advantage of these unseen parts of the signal. Examples of these extensions include teletext, closed captioning, digital information regarding the show title, transmitting a set of reference colors that allows TV sets to automatically correct the hue maladjustments common with the NTSC color encoding system, etc.\n\nOther extensions to the standard include S-video; S-video is an extension to the standard because it uses parallel signal paths for luminance and for chrominance (color), of which both of them can be connected to a composite video input but with either monochrome (luma), or uniform-luma color (chroma) unless merging the signal paths with a filter was done.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2791955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2791955", "title": "Denailing", "text": "Denailing\n\nDenailing is the extraction of the nails from the fingers and/or toes, either as a medical procedure to treat severe nail infections, or as a method of torture. The United Nations Istanbul Protocol describes nail removal and the insertion of objects such as wire under the nail as forms of torture. Removed nails are capable of growing back normally over several months if the nail matrix is left intact through surgical extraction. However, if the matrix is damaged by trauma, it can result in an overgrowth of tissue from the proximal nail fold, resulting in the formation of pterygium. Particularly, if the nail matrix is burnt by a heated instrument, subsequent growth may produce nails which are striped, thin, or broken into longitudinal segments.\n\nMedieval sources described the denailing interrogation process as conducted by laying the prisoner on a tabletop—securing the hands by chains around the wrists and the bare feet by chains around the ankles—and using a metal forceps or pliers—often heated red-hot—to individually grasp each nail in turn and slowly pry it from the nail bed before tearing it off the finger or toe. A more painful variant used in medieval Spain was performed by introducing a sharp wedge of wood or metal between the flesh and each nail and slowly hammering the wedge under the nail until it was torn free.\n\nAnother cruel variant involved using rough skewers of wood or bone dipped in boiling sulfur. A number of such skewers were slowly driven into the flesh under the prisoner's toenails. Alternately, the skewer was dipped in boiling oil, which served a dual purpose of both burning the incredibly sensitive flesh and lubricating the needle so that the torturer could freely explore a wide surface area beneath the toenail. When enough skewers had been driven home to pry each nail loose from its bed, the nail was torn out at the root with a pair of pliers. This was a favorite technique of torture in the German witch-hunter's arsenal, being extremely inexpensive, portable, and easy to inflict. It is also recorded that, in more recent times—particularly, during the Armenian genocide of the 1910s—phonograph needles were driven under fingernails and toenails to torture the prisoner before his nails were torn out with pliers.\n\nIn the aftermath of Italy's republican referendum after World War II, efforts to prosecute former officials in the Fascist government for collaborationism and war crimes resulted in the legal differentiation between the concepts of normal brutality, cruel brutality, and \"particularly cruel brutality\". Only in the case of particularly cruel brutality would the accused be rejected for amnesty. Denailing was generally considered to fall under the first two categories, as for a brutality to be considered \"particularly cruel\", it had to \"horrify even those who are familiar with torture.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1855357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1855357", "title": "Ecosystem services", "text": "Ecosystem services\n\nEcosystem services are the many and varied benefits that humans freely gain from the natural environment and from properly-functioning ecosystems. Such ecosystems include, for example, agroecosystems, forest ecosystems, grassland ecosystems and aquatic ecosystems. Collectively, these benefits are becoming known as 'ecosystem services', and are often integral to the provisioning of clean drinking water, the decomposition of wastes, and the natural pollination of crops and other plants.\n\nWhile scientists and environmentalists have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) in the early 2000s popularized the concept. There, ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories: \"provisioning\", such as the production of food and water; \"regulating\", such as the control of climate and disease; \"supporting\", such as nutrient cycles and oxygen production; and \"cultural\", such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values.\n\nWhile the notion of human dependence on Earth's ecosystems reaches to the start of \"Homo sapiens\" existence, the term 'natural capital' was first coined by E.F. Schumacher in 1973 in his book \"Small is Beautiful\" \".\" Recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least Plato (c. 400 BC) who understood that deforestation could lead to soil erosion and the drying of springs. Modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when Marsh challenged in 1864 the idea that Earth's natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in soil fertility in the Mediterranean. It was not until the late 1940s that three key authors—Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr, William Vogt, and Aldo Leopold —promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment.\n\nIn 1956, Paul Sears drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients. In 1970, Paul Ehrlich and Rosa Weigert called attention to \"ecological systems\" in their environmental science textbook and \"the most subtle and dangerous threat to man's existence... the potential destruction, by man's own activities, of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends\".\n\nThe term \"environmental services\" was introduced in a 1970 report of the \"Study of Critical Environmental Problems\", which listed services including insect pollination, fisheries, climate regulation and flood control. In following years, variations of the term were used, but eventually 'ecosystem services' became the standard in scientific literature.\n\nThe ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes socio-economic and conservation objectives, which are discussed below. A history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of 1997, can be found in Daily's book \"Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems\".\n\nWhile Gretchen Daily's original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services, Robert Costanza and colleagues' later work and that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services.\n\nPer the 2006 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), ecosystem services are \"the benefits people obtain from ecosystems\". The MA also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services—supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural—discussed below.\n\nBy 2010, there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature. To prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits, for instance, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) replaced \"Supporting Services\" in the MA with \"Habitat Services\" and \"ecosystem functions\", defined as \"a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services\".\n\nThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) report 2005 defines \"Ecosystem services\" as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services, where the so-called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories.\n\nThese include services such as nutrient recycling, primary production and soil formation. These services make it possible for the ecosystems to provide services such as food supply, flood regulation, and water purification.\n\n\n\n\nThere is discussion as to how the concept of cultural ecosystem services can be operationalized. A good review of approaches in landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance to define and assess cultural values of our environment so that they fit into the ecosystem services approach is given by Daniel et al. who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits.\nThere also is a fundamental \"critique\" of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments:\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them:\n\nUnderstanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in ecology, which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the environment. Since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from microbes to landscapes, milliseconds to millions of years, one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them. For example, the area of a forest floor, the detritus upon it, the microorganisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water purification, and erosion prevention to other areas within the watershed. Note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured, there may also be ancillary benefits—the same forest may provide habitat for other organisms as well as human recreation, which are also ecosystem services.\n\nThe complexity of Earth's ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms, processes and their surroundings. As it relates to human ecology, a suggested research agenda for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps:\n\nRecently, a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of ESP functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance. Such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment (i.e. predators, resource availability, climate) and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services. However, a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions, which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority. Even so, estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the resilience of an ecosystem amidst environmental change.\n\nMany ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with biodiversity. Increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem's stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services.\n\nThe concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as \"functional compensation\" and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem. More specifically, it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem. However, such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent disturbance. The redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as \"species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience\".\n\nAnother idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem; this is sometimes referred to as \"rivet popping\". If only one species disappears, the loss of the ecosystem's efficiency as a whole is relatively small; however, if several species are lost, the system essentially collapses—similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets. The hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis. As a result, the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem. The key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning.\n\nA third explanation, known as the \"portfolio effect\", compares biodiversity to stock holdings, where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment, or in this case, the risk of instability of ecosystem services. This is related to the idea of \"response diversity\" where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation. When considered together, they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service.\n\nSeveral experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab. In ECOTRON, a laboratory in the UK where many of the biotic and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated, studies have focused on the effects of earthworms and symbiotic bacteria on plant roots. These laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis. However, a study on grasslands at Cedar Creek Reserve in Minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis, as have many other field studies.\n\nThere are questions regarding the environmental and economic values of ecosystem services. Some people may be unaware of the environment in general and humanity's interrelatedness with the natural environment, which may cause misconceptions. Although environmental awareness is rapidly improving in our contemporary world, ecosystem capital and its flow are still poorly understood, threats continue to impose, and we suffer from the so-called 'tragedy of the commons'. Many efforts to inform decision-makers of current versus future costs and benefits now involve organizing and translating scientific knowledge to economics, which articulate the consequences of our choices in comparable units of impact on human well-being. An especially challenging aspect of this process is that interpreting ecological information collected from one spatial-temporal scale does not necessarily mean it can be applied at another; understanding the dynamics of ecological processes relative to ecosystem services is essential in aiding economic decisions. Weighting factors such as a service's irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient.\n\nThe economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information, areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers. In general, the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons, trends reveal the aggregative preferences of a society, from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are:\n\n\nA peer-reviewed study published in 1997 estimated the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital to be between US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year. However, Salles (2011) indicates 'The total value of biodiversity is infinite, so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can't live without it'.\n\nAlthough monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services, the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and multitudinous. The administration of common pool resources is a subject of extensive academic pursuit. From defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways, there is much to overcome. Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information. Existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health-based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect ecosystem health and services. To improve the information available, one suggestion has involved the implementation of an \"Ecosystem Services Framework\" (ESF), which integrates the biophysical and socio-economic dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide institutions through multidisciplinary information and jargon, helping to direct strategic choices.\n\nNovel and expedient methods are needed to deal with managing Earth's ecosystem services. Local to regional collective management efforts might be considered appropriate for services like crop pollination or resources like water. Another approach that has become increasingly popular over the last decade is the marketing of ecosystem services protection. Payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small-scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the restoration of ecosystem service providers. In some cases, banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges, defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions. However, crucial for implementation are clearly defined land rights, which is often lacking in many developing countries. In particular, many forest-rich developing countries suffering deforestation experience conflict between different forest stakeholders. In addition, concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use. Another approach has been focused on protecting ecosystem service 'hotspots'. Recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals (i.e. biodiversity) has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success. This may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across landscapes, and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors.\n\nFor example, in recent years there has been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by shellfish production and restoration. A keystone species, low in the food chain, bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of \"ecosystem engineers\"—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms. Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling excess nutrients in the water.\n\nEcosystem-based adaptation or EbA is an emerging strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity currently defines Ecosystem-Based Adaptation as \"the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change\", which includes the use of \"sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems, as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social, economic and cultural co-benefits for local communities\".\n\nIn 2001, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment announced that humanity's impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen, and that the degradation of the planet's ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In recognition of this fact, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation seeks to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping-stone to improving the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. Specifically, this involves the restoration of ecosystems that provide the community with essential services, such as the provisioning of food and water and protection from storm surges and flooding. EbA interventions typically combine elements of both climate change mitigation and adaptation to global warming to help address the community's current and future needs.\n\nCollaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.\n\nEcosystem services are defined as the gains acquired by humankind from surroundings ecosystems. Four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body: regulating services, provisioning services, cultural services and supporting services. An ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously; but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem, it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services. The services offered by diverse types of ecosystems (forests, seas, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) differ in nature and in consequence. In fact, some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations (such as fresh water, food or aesthetic value, etc.) while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted (such as climate change, erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation, etc.).\n\nEstuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems. An estuary is defined as the area in which a river meets the sea or the ocean. The waters surrounding this area are predominantly salty waters or brackish waters; and the incoming river water is dynamically motioned by the tide. An estuary strip may be covered by populations of reed (or similar plants) and/or sandbanks (or similar form or land).\n\nA coastal ecosystem occurs in areas where the sea or ocean waters meet the land.\n\nRegulating services are the \"benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes\". In the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, these services include climate regulation, waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation.\n\nBoth the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation. They act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere, retaining large levels of CO and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide). Marine plants also use CO for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric CO. The oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents, and atmospheric processes, such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere. The ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world: \"without the ocean, the Earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold, if not frozen, at night\".\n\nAnother service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes, thus helping in the regulation of diseases. Wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems; pollutants are removed from the environment and stored, buried or recycled in marine ecosystems: \"Marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water, reduce/limit the effects of eutrophication, and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water\". The fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood.\n\nCoastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges and storms. The role they play is to \"[absorb] a portion of the impact and thus [lessen] its effect on the land\". Wetlands, for example, and the vegetation it supports – trees, root mats, etc. – retain large amounts of water (surface water, snowmelt, rain, groundwater) and then slowly releases them back, decreasing the likeliness of floods. Mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents; a process that was studied after the 1999 cyclone that hit India. Villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren't protected by mangroves.\n\nProvisioning services consist of all \"the products obtained from ecosystems\". Marine ecosystems provide people with: wild & cultured seafood, fresh water, fiber & fuel and biochemical & genetic resources.\n\nHumans consume a large number of products originating from the seas, whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors: \"More than one billion people worldwide, or one-sixth of the global population, rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In 2000, marine and coastal fisheries accounted for 12 per cent of world food production\". Fish and other edible marine products – primarily fish, shellfish, roe and seaweeds – constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions. A very pertinent example would be sushi, the national food of Japan, which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed.\n\nWater bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as 'fresh water' bodies. Fresh water may run through lakes, rivers and streams, to name a few; but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground. Fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans, but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals, plants.\n\nMarine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing, building materials (lime extracted from coral reefs), ornamental items and personal-use items (luffas, art and jewelry): \"The skin of marine mammals for clothing, gas deposits for energy production, lime (extracted from coral reefs) for building construction, and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms. Raw marine materials are utilized for non-essential goods as well, such as shells and corals in ornamental items\". Humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy: using the power of waves – or tidal power – as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine, for example. Oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms.\n\nBiochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other biochemical products. Genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field. These resources are either directly taken out from an organism – such as fish oil as a source of omega3 –, or used as a model for innovative man-made products: \"such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges. ... Compared to terrestrial products, marine-sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive, likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea-water\".\n\nCultural services relate to the non-material world, as they benefit the benefit recreational, aesthetic, cognitive and spiritual activities, which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms.\n\nMarine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art, music, architecture, traditions... Water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective. Many also consider the water as being a part of their personality, especially if they have lived near it since they were kids: they associate it to fond memories and past experiences. Living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region.\n\nSea sports are very popular among coastal populations: surfing, snorkeling, whale watching, kayaking, recreational fishing...a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities, and relax near the water. \n\nA lot can be learned from marine processes, environments and organisms – that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain. Although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world: \"by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales, time lags, and cumulative effects\".\n\nSupporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present. They have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time. Several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating/cultural/provisioning services.\n\nNutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes. The ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other. Nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose, releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment. \"The service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive\".\n\nBiologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms. These need not to be designed for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat, but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally. For example, coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish, seaweed and shellfish... The importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species, aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services. They are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species (breeding and bursary spaces), as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators. \n\nPrimary production refers to the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.\n\nEcosystem services degradation can pose a number of risks to corporate performance as well as provide business opportunities through ecosystem restoration and enhancement. Risks and opportunities include:\n\n\nMany companies are not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications. Likewise, environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle \"traditional\" issues of pollution and natural resource consumption. Most focus on environmental impacts, not dependence. Several newly developed tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services. These include Our Ecosystem, the Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (ESR), Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES), the Natural Value Initiative (NVI) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services & Tradeoffs) \n\nEcosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of ecology, technology, society and the economy. The process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information, honor all stakeholder viewpoints, including regulatory agencies, proposal proponents, decision makers, residents, NGOs, and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection. These decisions are usually spatial, always multi-objective, and based on uncertain data, models, and estimates. Often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values, estimates and opinions that drive the process.\n\nOne analytical study modeled the stakeholders as agents to support water resource management decisions in the Middle Rio Grande basin of New Mexico. This study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision, but ignored uncertainty. Another study used Monte Carlo methods to exercise econometric models of landowner decisions in a study of the effects of land-use change. Here the stakeholder inputs were modeled as random effects to reflect the uncertainty. A third study used a Bayesian decision support system to both model the uncertainty in the scientific information Bayes Nets and to assist collecting and fusing the input from stakeholders. This study was about siting wave energy devices off the Oregon Coast, but presents a general method for managing uncertain spatial science and stakeholder information in a decision making environment. Remote sensing data and analyses can be used to assess the health and extent of land cover classes that provide ecosystem services, which aids in planning, management, monitoring of stakeholders' actions, and communication between stakeholders.\n\nIn Baltic countries scientists, nature conservationists and local authorities are implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems. They are developing Integrated Planning Tool that will be based on GIS (geographic information system) technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland. It will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30862583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30862583", "title": "Eggshell skull", "text": "Eggshell skull\n\nThe eggshell rule (or thin skull rule) is a well-established legal doctrine in common law, used in some tort law systems, with a similar doctrine applicable to criminal law. The rule states that, in a tort case, the unexpected frailty of the injured person is not a valid defense to the seriousness of any injury caused to them.\n\nThis rule holds that a tortfeasor is liable for all consequences resulting from their tortious (usually negligent) activities leading to an injury to another person, even if the victim suffers an unusually high level of damage (e.g. due to a pre-existing vulnerability or medical condition). The eggshell skull rule takes into account the physical, social and economic attributes of the plaintiff which might make them more susceptible to injury. It may also take into account the family and cultural environment. The term implies that if a person had a skull as delicate as that of the shell of an egg, and a tortfeasor who was unaware of the condition injured that person's head, causing the skull unexpectedly to break, the defendant would be held liable for all damages resulting from the wrongful contact, even if the tortfeasor did not intend to cause such a severe injury.\n\nIn criminal law, the general maxim is that the defendant must \"take their victims as they find them\", as echoed in the judgment of Lord Justice Lawton in \"R v. Blaue\" (1975), in which the defendant was held responsible for killing his victim, despite his contention that her refusal of a blood transfusion constituted \"novus actus interveniens\".\n\nThe doctrine is applied in all areas of torts – intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability cases – as well as in criminal law. There is no requirement of physical contact with the victim – if a trespasser's wrongful presence on the victim's property so terrifies the victim that he has a fatal heart attack, the trespasser will be liable for the damages stemming from his original tort. The foundation for this rule is based primarily on policy grounds. The courts do not want the defendant or accused to rely on the victim's own vulnerability to avoid liability.\n\nThe thin skull rule is not to be confused with the related crumbling skull rule in which the plaintiff suffers from a detrimental position (from a prior injury, for instance) pre-existent to the occurrence of the present tort. In the \"crumbling skull\" rule, the prior condition is only to be considered with respect to distinguishing it from any new injury arising from the present tort – as a means of apportioning damages in such a way that the defendant would not be liable for placing the plaintiff in a better position than they were in prior to the present tort.\n\nIn an example, a person who has Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI; also known as \"Brittle Bone Syndrome\") is more likely to be injured in a motor vehicle accident. If the person with OI is hit from behind in a motor vehicle collision and suffers medical damages (such as clavicle fracture), it would not be a prudent defense to state that the Osteogenesis Imperfecta was the cause of the fracture.\n\n(UK) In the case of \"Smith v Leech Brain & Co\", an employee in a factory was splashed with molten metal. The metal burned him on his lip, which happened to be premalignant tissue. He died three years later from cancer triggered by the injury. The judge held that as long as the initial injury was foreseeable, the defendant was liable for all the harm.\n\n(US) In 1891, the Wisconsin Supreme Court came to a similar result in \"Vosburg v. Putney\". In that case, a boy threw a small kick at another from across the aisle in the classroom. It turned out that the victim had an unknown microbial condition that was irritated, and resulted in him entirely losing the use of his leg. No one could have predicted the level of injury. Nevertheless, the court found that the kicking was unlawful because it violated the \"order and decorum of the classroom\", and the perpetrator was therefore fully liable for the injury.\n\n(US) In \"Benn v. Thomas\", the appellate court determined that the eggshell rule should have been applied to a case in which a man had a heart attack and died after being bruised in the chest during a rear-end car accident.\n\n(Aus) In the case of \"Nader v Urban Transit Authority of NSW\", the plaintiff was a 10 year old boy who struck his head on a bus stop pole while alighting from a slowly moving bus. He developed a rare psychological condition known as Ganser Syndrome. The defendant argued that the illness resulted from his family’s response to the accident. McHugh JA said (at 537), \"The defendant must take the plaintiff with all his weaknesses, beliefs and reactions as well as his capacities and attributes, physical, social and economic. If the result of an accident is that a ten year old boy reacts to his parents’ concern over his injuries and develops an hysterical condition, no reason of justice, morality or entrenched principle appears to me to prevent his recovery of compensation.\"\n\n(Aus) In the case of \"Kavanagh v Akhtar\", the court held the tortfeasor should take into account the plaintiff's family and cultural setting. Equality before the law puts a heavy onus on the person who would argue that the \"unusual\" reaction of an injured plaintiff should be disregarded because a minority religious or cultural situation may not have been foreseeable.\n\nIntervening cause is typically an exception to the eggshell skull rule. If an injury is not immediate, but a separate situation agitates the injury (such as the injured party being involved in a vehicular collision while being taken to a hospital), the tortfeasor is not liable under common law in Australia (see \"Haber v Walker\", and \"Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions\"). In \"Haber v Walker\" it was held that a plaintiff will not be liable for a novus actus interveniens (intervening act) if the chain of causation was broken by a voluntary, human act or, an independent event, which in conjunction with the wrongful act, was so unlikely as to be termed a coincidence. In \"Mahoney v Kruschich Demolitions\" the plaintiff, Glogovic, was injured while working on the demolition of a power house for the respondent. While being treated for his injuries, his injuries were exacerbated by the negligent medical treatment of the appellant, Mahony. It was held that there was no novus actus as a result of medical treatment of injuries caused by the defendant’s negligence, unless such treatment is inexcusably bad or completely outside the bounds of what a reputable medical practitioner might prescribe.\n"}

Her work promotes the participation of the public.\n\nElena Tejada-Herrera studied painting but attained public attention in a controversial way. She became known within the Peruvian art scene at the end of the 90’s thanks to her performance and multimedia works related to the Peruvian socio economical context, marginal urban cultural expressions and popular culture. Since then she has proposed diverse reflections about the female body and gender constructions with her works. Her works are disinhibited, unapologetic, and scape the normative criteria that characterizes Peruvian contemporary art in general. During the last 15 years her works have generated situations that promote public participation and the realization of collective aesthetic experiences.\n\nElena Tejada-Herrera became known as a painter, but got great attention because of her performance art work.\nIn 1999 Tejada-Herrera presented her video performance Bomba and the Bataclana in the Belly Dance in which the artist appeared as a cabaret dancer along with street sellers that she hired to perform with her. This piece dealt with the body, gender constructions, and incorporated the participation of the public. The artist was awarded the first prize in the art contest Passport for an Artist for this artwork.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006 while living in Virginia Tejada-Herrera focused each time more on pieces that incorporated the participation of the public like the series Paper Animals, Holding the House Together, One Day Around The Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. For this piece Tejada-Herrera asked strangers on stores, and in her neighborhood to teach her how to dance and to choreograph her. Simultaneously she carried on landscape interventions on highways that addressed the drivers as her audience. Other pieces were performances interventions in malls and different public spaces\n\nIn 2007 Tejada-Herrera was selected to represent Peru at the Nipon International Performance Festival (NIPAF). Her participation consisted of a long distance telephone performance. For this event Tejada-Herrera called random numbers from the telephone books from the cities of Tokyo, and Nagoya. Her conversations with strangers related to the situation of women immigrants in Japan. Tejada-Herrera continued with these long distance telephone performances with Canada, and with Peru. In Peru she presented an installation that included a phone from which the audience could hear her long distance recorded conversations with her mother.\n\nThe same year she participated as a feature artist at PerformIt in Tucson Arizona, organized by the Plugged Art Collective. Her participation included the performances The Teasing Monkey, Gallery Security, What Would It Take to leave Every Thing Behind, Acts of Love, Grooming Me, and Always Up.\nAlso in 2007 Elena was awarded the Grand Prix for her performances at the Parnu Performance Festival, in Estonia.\n\nIn 2008 Tejada-Herrera presented the exhibition \"About You\" at Dean Project Gallery in Long Island City Queens, New York. This exhibition started with street performances for which Tejada-Herrera invited passers by to participate. The performances included conversations, video portraits, and ephemeral performances made with the body among others. The passers by and witnesses were invited to the gallery to write their experiences and about their days. The exhibition opened with a video projection of the performance of the day and the first writings by the public on the gallery walls. Little by little the walls were filled with texts. On a Sunday Tejada-Herrera invited the public outside the gallery to enter and to paint on the walls. This was their day, in which the passers by painted and exhibited their creations within Tejada-Herrera's exhibition. At the closing reception, more video documentation of the performances made by Tejada-Herrera with the public and photographs were added. These were displayed in between the texts and paintings made by the public.\n\nIn 2009 Tejada-Herrera traveled to Lima, Peru where she was invited to create an artwork at the Peruvian National Library. Elena Tejada-Herrera was granted permission to create artworks with the librarians during their working hours. Tejada-Herrera invited the librarians to bring their hobbies to their offices, and to participate within video art pieces. Tejada-Herrera also brought an approach with which she was working for many years since her first stay in Virginia, USA. This approach consisted of working within people's homes, like in the piece Paper Animals, and One Day at the Neighborhood Choreographing My Dance. The piece created within this process was Art Delivery realized with the librarian Nelly Bobbio. The resulting artwork is a video art piece with the librarian's voice over. This voice over explained the detail of her practice as a librarian while in the video she is performing a sculpture using her body and the furniture in her house. This piece features what Tejada-Herrera calls cultural exchanges, approach in which Tejada-Herrera explains her art practice to the participant who then she invites to interpret from his/her own perspective using the materials at hand. In this case the materials were the domestic furniture. The exhibition presented several video screens placed on top of wooden library furniture. There were huge amounts of shredded paper coming out of the furniture drawers on to the floor, covering big areas. The videos displayed the librarians executing their hobbies and expressing their opinions. There were librarians acting in front of the camera, singing solo and in group. There were librarians singing a serenata for a sanitation worker at the library. Another librarian sang karaoke in front of his co-workers. In a video piece a librarian was working while shredded paper covered him and his whole office. A librarian performed his normal regular duties as a librarian on a desk inside the gallery while he listened at his favorite music and Tejada-Herrera served him coffee and his favorite snacks.\n\nBack in the United States Tejada-Herrera presented several art installations made in collaboration with office workers that facilitated the shredded paper that they collected for 15 days. These installations were presented at Miami International University. One of these pieces consisted of giant plastic bags filled with huge amounts of shredded paper. the other installation was a shelf from which colorful shredded paper fell like a waterfall on the floor. The installation ended with a participative performance with the workers.\n\nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera participated in a residency at Atlantic Center for the Arts. Within this Tejada-Herrera created several photo and video series. \nIn 2010 Tejada-Herrera traveled to Huancayo in Peru where she co-led a workshop along with the architect Alberto Tejada Herrera. The workshop was part of the CONEA, (Congreso Nacional de Estudiantes de Arquitectura) (National Peruvian Congress of Architectural Students). in this workshop the students created architectural installations on public parks in the area. These were a playground and a bus stop.\n\nThe following years Tejada-Herrera realized several video art works with the subject of the male body and sexuality from a woman's point of view. Her works included a homage to the artist Giuseppe Campuzano.\n\nSince 2011 Tejada-Herrera returned to some object based art making, creating room sized installations and conceptual landscape interventions in the United States and Europe, including Chicago and Prague.\n\nIn 2015 Tejada-Herrera presented an exhibition as part of 2nd Floor Rear, in which she invited the public to create costumes, sculptures, and art installations using the lines that she previously made with objects for the room sized installation Lengths of Consumption. The piece called \"Playtime is About You\" started with video projections of Zumba tutorials. After warming up the public was invited to play and create the collective installation.\n\nAlso in 2015 Elena Tejada-Herrera participated at the Chicago Home Theater Festival. The hosts for her site specific project were the artist Faheem Majeed and his wife LaShana Jackson. \nJust as in former projects, Tejada-Herrera invited her hosts to participate within the artwork. The video piece was presented on the 16th of May at Majeed's and Jackson's home along with the artworks of other local artists from Chicago.\n\nTejada-Herrera has a continuous presence within the art scene in Chicago, other cities in the United States and Internationally. Her production is a hybrid that blends conceptual approaches, new media, and participative art practices.\n"}

The term first appeared in the late 1990s and was the topic of the Seventh Annual Washington Evolutionary Systems Conference at University of Ghent, Belgium in May, 1999. Emergent organizations and their dynamics pose interesting questions; for example, how does such an organization achieve closure and stability?\n\nAlternatively, James R. Taylor wrote in 2000 his seminal book, \"The Emergent Organization\", where he suggests that all organizations emerge from communication, especially from the interplay of conversation and text. This idea concerns human organizations, but is consistent with Leibniz or Gabriel Tarde's monadology, or with Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, which explains the macro—both in human and non-human \"societies\"—from the processes taking place between its constituent parts.\n\n"}
{"id": "24526687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24526687", "title": "Emotional blackmail", "text": "Emotional blackmail\n\nEmotional blackmail and FOG are terms, popularized by psychotherapist Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that fear, obligation, and guilt (FOG) are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.\n\nThe first documented use of \"emotional blackmail\" appeared in 1947 in the \"Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women\" in the article \"Emotional Blackmail Climate\". The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers. Esther Vilar, an Argentine physician, also used the term \"emotional blackmail\" in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children.\n\nEmotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends). Children, too, will employ special pleading and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system.\n\nEmotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist. Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as \"FOG\". FOG is a contrived acronym—a play on the word \"fog\" which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.\n\nThe person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.\n\nUnder pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's breakdown. and could fall into a pattern of letting the blackmailer control his/her decisions and behavior, lost in what Doris Lessing described as \"a sort of psychological fog\".\n\nForward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:\nThere are different levels of demands—demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.\n\nAddicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.\n\nPeople with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with paranoid personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nPeople with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to use emotional blackmail (as too are destructive narcissists). However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of hopelessness, rather than being the product of any conscious plan.\n\nCodependency often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.\n\nAffluenza—the status insecurity derived from obsessively keeping up with the Joneses—has been linked by Oliver James to a pattern of childhood training whereby sufferers were \"subjected to a form of emotional blackmail as toddlers. Their mothers' love becomes conditional on exhibiting behaviour that achieved parental goals.\"\n\nAssertiveness training encourages people to not engage in fruitless back-and-forths or power struggles with the emotional blackmailer but instead to repeat a neutral statement, such as \"I can see how you feel that way,\" or, if pressured to eat, say \"No thank you, I'm not hungry.\" They are taught to keep their statements within certain boundaries in order not to capitulate to coercive nagging, emotional blackmail, or bullying.\n\nTechniques for resisting emotional blackmail include strengthening personal boundaries, resisting demands, developing a \"power statement\"—the determination to stand the pressure—and buying time to break old patterns. Re-connecting with the autonomous parts of the self the blackmailer had over-ruled is not necessarily easy. One may feel guilty based on emotional blackmail, even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational; but still be able to resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of having a tantrum.\n\nConsistently ignoring the manipulation in a friendly way may however lead to its intensification, and threats of separation, or to accusations of being \"crazy\" or a \"home wrecker\".\n\n\nDaniel Miller objects that in popular psychology the idea of emotional blackmail has been misused as a defense against any form of fellow-feeling or consideration for others.\n\nLabeling of this dynamic with inflammatory terms such as \"blackmail\" and \"manipulation\" may not be so helpful as it is both polarizing and it implies premeditation and malicious intent which is often not the case. Controlling behavior and being controlled is a transaction between two people with both playing a part.\n"}
{"id": "30185050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30185050", "title": "Empty lattice approximation", "text": "Empty lattice approximation\n\nThe empty lattice approximation is a theoretical electronic band structure model in which the potential is \"periodic\" and \"weak\" (close to constant). One may also consider an empty irregular lattice, in which the potential is not even periodic. The empty lattice approximation describes a number of properties of energy dispersion relations of non-interacting free electrons that move through a crystal lattice. The energy of the electrons in the \"empty lattice\" is the same as the energy of free electrons. The model is useful because it clearly illustrates a number of the sometimes very complex features of energy dispersion relations in solids which are fundamental to all electronic band structures.\n\nThe periodic potential of the lattice in this free electron model must be weak because otherwise the electrons wouldn't be free. The strength of the scattering mainly depends on the geometry and topology of the system. Topologically defined parameters, like scattering cross sections, depend on the magnitude of the potential and the size of the potential well. For 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional spaces potential wells do always scatter waves, no matter how small their potentials are, what their signs are or how limited their sizes are. For a particle in a one-dimensional lattice, like the Kronig-Penney model, it is possible to calculate the band structure analytically by substituting the values for the potential, the lattice spacing and the size of potential well. For two and three-dimensional problems it is more difficult to calculate a band structure based on a similar model with a few parameters accurately. Nevertheless, the properties of the band structure can easily be approximated in most regions by perturbation methods.\n\nIn theory the lattice is infinitely large, so a weak periodic scattering potential will eventually be strong enough to reflect the wave. The scattering process results in the well known Bragg reflections of electrons by the periodic potential of the crystal structure. This is the origin of the periodicity of the dispersion relation and the division of k-space in Brillouin zones. The periodic energy dispersion relation is expressed\nas:\n\nThe formula_2 are the reciprocal lattice vectors to which the bands formula_3 belong.\n\nThe figure on the right shows the dispersion relation for three periods in reciprocal space of a one-dimensional lattice with lattice cells of length \"a\".\nIn a one-dimensional lattice the number of reciprocal lattice vectors formula_2 that determine the bands in an energy interval is limited to two when the energy rises. In two and three dimensional lattices the number of reciprocal lattice vectors that determine the free electron bands formula_3 increases more rapidly when the length of the wave vector increases and the energy rises. This is because the number of reciprocal lattice vectors formula_2 that lie in an interval formula_7 increases. The density of states in an energy interval formula_8 depends on the number of states in an interval formula_7 in reciprocal space and the slope of the dispersion relation formula_3.\nThough the lattice cells are not spherically symmetric, the dispersion relation still has spherical symmetry from the point of view of a fixed central point in a reciprocal lattice cell if the dispersion relation is extended outside the central Brillouin zone. The density of states in a three-dimensional lattice will be the same as in the case of the absence of a lattice. For the three-dimensional case the density of states formula_11 is;\n\nIn three-dimensional space the Brillouin zone boundaries are planes. The dispersion relations show conics of the free-electron energy dispersion parabolas for all possible reciprocal lattice vectors. This results in a very complicated set intersecting of curves when the dispersion relations are calculated because there is a large number of possible angles between evaluation trajectories, first and higher order Brillouin zone boundaries and dispersion parabola intersection cones.\n\n\"Free electrons\" that move through the lattice of a solid with wave vectors formula_13 far outside the first Brillouin zone are still reflected back into the first Brillouin zone. See the external links section for sites with examples and figures.\n\nIn most simple metals, like aluminium, the screening effect strongly reduces the electric field of the ions in the solid. The electrostatic potential is expressed as\n\nwhere \"Z\" is the atomic number, \"e\" is the elementary unit charge, \"r\" is the distance to the nucleus of the embedded ion and \"q\" is a screening parameter that determines the range of the potential. The Fourier transform, formula_15, of the lattice potential, formula_16, is expressed as\n\nWhen the values of the off-diagonal elements formula_15 between the reciprocal lattice vectors in the Hamiltonian almost go to zero. As a result, the magnitude of the band gap formula_19 collapses and the empty lattice approximation is obtained.\n\nApart from a few exotic exceptions, metals crystallize in three kinds of crystal structures: the BCC and FCC cubic crystal structures and the hexagonal close-packed HCP crystal structure. \n\n"}

It requires all executive departments, agencies, bureaus, and offices to disclose public records, contracts, transactions, and any information requested by a member of the public, except for matters affecting national security and other information that falls under the inventory of exceptions issued by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. The landmark order was signed two days before Duterte delivered his first State of the Nation Address and just three weeks after he assumed the presidency on June 30, 2016.\n\nThe FOI Executive Order provides for full public disclosure of all government records involving public interest, and upholds the constitutional right of people to information on matters of public concern.\n\nThe Order states:\nThe Order defines \"information\" to include any\nThe law expansively defines \"official records\" as \"information produced or received by a public officer or employee, or by a government office in an official capacity or pursuant to a public function or duty,\" while \"public records\" refer to \"information required by laws, executive orders, rules, or regulations to be entered, kept and made publicly available by a government office.\" It also emphasizes the obligation of all public officials to file and make available for scrutiny their Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) in accordance with existing laws, jurispridence, and implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the Order.\n\nThe Order covers the national government and all its offices, departments, bureaus, and instrumentalities, including Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). It also encourages all Local Government Units (LGUs) to observe and be guided by this Order.\n\nThe Order instructs the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to prepare and submit an inventory of information that falls under any of the exceptions enshrined in the Constitution, existing laws or jurisprudence, within 30 days. It adds that the inventory of exceptions shall be periodically updated to \"properly reflect any change in existing laws and jurisprudence.\"\n\nOn 22 August 2016, the DOJ and OSG submitted a list of 166 exceptions, 158 of which are \"exceptions to FOI\" and six (6) more listed as \"other exceptions.\" The draft list includes information that \"directly relates to national security and internal or external defense of the state;\" matters of foreign affairs which \"could affect ongoing bilateral or multilateral negotiations;\" law enforcement matters; and proceedings and investigations being conducted by public authorities.\n\nIt also lists as exception information that might endanger a person's life or safety, such as medical records, bank deposits, and other information considered as privileged communication in legal proceedings by law or by the rules of court.

If access has been denied wholly or in part, reasons must be provided to the applicant. The oOder states: \"No request for information shall be denied unless it clearly falls under any of the exceptions listed in the inventory or updated inventory of exceptions.\"\n\nThe 15 working day response period may be extended to additional 20 working days, in cases where the information being requested requires extensive research or examination of voluminous records. The response period may also be prolonged in the event of unexpected disruption to government services. The government official is then required to notify the applicant of the extension. Failure to notify the requesting party of the action taken on the request within the response period will be viewed as a denial of the request.\n\nAccepting requests for government information is free of charge. However, Section 10 of the Order states that government offices may impose reasonable fees to reimburse costs for printing and reproductions of the requested information.\n\nPursuant to the Order, failure to comply with its provisions may be a ground for administrative and disciplinary sanctions against any erring public officer based on the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.\n\nA person whose request for access to information has been denied may file an appeal to the Central Appeals and Review Committee of the concerned agency.\n\nWritten appeal must be filed by the same person making the request within 15 calendar days from the notice of denial or from the lapse of the period to respond to the request.

Failure of such person or office to decide within the period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.\n\nUpon exhaustion of administrative appeal remedies, the requesting party may file the appropriate judicial action in accordance with the Rules of Court.\n\nThrough Memorandum Order No. 10, s. 2016, the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) mandated the PCOO to act as the lead implementing agency for the FOI Program. To operationalize this, the PCOO established the Freedom of Information - Project Management Office (FOI-PMO) through PCOO Department Order No. 18, s. 2017.\n\nThe vision of the FOI-PMO is to regain public trust by revolutionizing how the government discloses information to the citizens and ensuring that government agencies respond to citizen concerns and provide the information they need, all within 15 to 35 working days.\n\nAlthough the Order only covers agencies under the Executive Branch, LGUs and other government agencies outside the Executive Branch are encouraged to observe and be guided by the Order Ref.\n\nAs of August 2018, the following offices have submitted their FOI Manuals either in paper and/or digital format, and complied with the provisions in the said Order:\n\n\nBased on a thorough review of the top requested information from government agencies, it has been found that there is a high demand for local, granular information, News Art such as Internal Revenue Allotments, Regional Development Plans, and information on the Local Government Support Fund.

There are many opinions as to what constitutes a good citizen. Theodore Roosevelt said, \"The first requisite of a good citizen in this Republic of ours is that he shall be able and willing to pull his weight.\" Education is sometimes viewed as a prerequisite to good citizenship, in that it helps citizens make good decisions and deal with demagogues who would delude them. Roger Soder writes that in a democracy, where the demands of good citizenship are placed upon all, \"only the common schools can provide to all the education that all need.\" Science literacy is also frequently touted as a key to good citizenship. Good citizenship is sometimes viewed as requiring both intellectual skills (such as critical thinking) and participatory skills (such as deliberating civilly, monitoring the government, building coalitions, managing conflict peacefully and fairly, and petitioning, speaking or testifying before public bodies).\n\nHenry David Thoreau wrote that men who serve the state making \"no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense...are commonly esteemed good citizens.\" Orit Ichilov notes that children \"tend to perceive the government in the image of an ideal father that is benevolent and protective. At this stage, the good citizen is characterized as one who, through his behavior, proves himself one worthy of the love and protection of the government rather than one possessing certain political obligations and rights.\" Through their early school years, children usually continue to think in apolitical terms of their citizenship, expressing loyalty by their desire to remain in their country due to an attachment to its beauty, wildlife, and good people. By age twelve or thirteen, they begin referring more to political qualities, such as the nature and values of the regime. High school seniors define the good citizen primarily in political terms. Some students define good citizenship in terms of standing up for what one believes in. Joel Westheimer identifies the personally responsible citizen (who acts responsibly in his community, e.g. by donating blood), the participatory citizen (who is an active member of community organizations and/or improvement efforts) and the justice-oriented citizen (who critically assesses social, political, and economic structures to see beyond surface causes) as three different types of \"good citizen.\"\n\nSometimes incentives prevail over desires to be a good citizen. For example, many people will avoid coming forth as witnesses in court cases because they do not want to deal with the inconvenience and red tape. Aristotle makes a distinction between the good citizen and the good man, writing, \"...there cannot be a single absolute excellence of the good citizen. But the good man is so called in virtue of a single absolute excellence. It is thus clear that it is possible to be a good citizen without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man.\" Specifically, in his view, the good citizen is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one Greek word being translated \"good.\"\n\nMany organizations attempt to promote \"good citizenship.\" For example, the Boy Scouts of America published \"\", and the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship is given to those who are deemed to have made outstanding contributions to the well being of their communities without expectation of remuneration or reward. Another non profit organization, Good Citizen, has a mission to teach Americans how to be effective citizens and focuses on 100 citizen actions.\n\n"}

This location may be either a home territory, or a breeding spot.\n\nHoming abilities can be used to find the way back to home in a migration. It is often used in reference to going back to a breeding spot seen years before, as in the case of salmon. Homing abilities can also be used to go back to familiar territory when displaced over long distances, such as with the red-bellied newt.\n\nSome animals use true navigation for their homing. This means in familiar areas they will use landmarks such as roads, rivers or mountains when flying, or islands and other landmarks while swimming. However, this only works in familiar territory. Homing pigeons, for example, will often navigate using familiar landmarks, such as roads. Sea turtles will also use landmarks to orient themselves.\n\nMany animals use magnetic orientation based on the Earth's magnetic field to find their way home. This is usually used together with other methods, such as a sun compass, as in bird migration and in the case of turtles. This is also commonly used when no other methods are available, as in the case of lobsters, which live underwater, and mole rats, which home through their underground burrows.\n\nCelestial orientation, navigation using the stars, is commonly used for homing. Displaced marbled newts, for example, can only home when stars are visible.\n\nThere is evidence that olfaction, or smell, is used in homing with several salamanders, such as the red-bellied newt. Olfaction is also necessary for the homing of salmon.\n\nTopographic memory, memory of the contours surrounding the destination, is one common method for navigation. This is mainly used by animals with less intelligence, such as molluscs. Limpets use this to find their way back to the home scrape; although whether this is true homing has been disputed.\n\n"}
{"id": "142131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142131", "title": "Hornbostel–Sachs", "text": "Hornbostel–Sachs\n\nHornbostel–Sachs or Sachs–Hornbostel is a system of musical instrument classification devised by Erich Moritz von Hornbostel and Curt Sachs, and first published in the \"Zeitschrift für Ethnologie\" in 1914. An English translation was published in the \"Galpin Society Journal\" in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying musical instruments by ethnomusicologists and organologists (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project.\n\nHornbostel and Sachs based their ideas on a system devised in the late 19th century by Victor-Charles Mahillon, the curator of musical instruments at Brussels Conservatory. Mahillon divided instruments into four broad categories according to the nature of the sound-producing material: an air column; string; membrane; and body of the instrument. From this basis, Hornbostel and Sachs expanded Mahillon's system to make it possible to classify any instrument from any culture.\n\nFormally, the Hornbostel–Sachs is modeled on the Dewey Decimal Classification for libraries. It has five top-level classifications, with several levels below those, adding up to over 300 basic categories in all. The top five levels of the scheme are as follows:\n\nIdiophones primarily produce their sounds by means of the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air. In essence, this group includes all percussion instruments apart from drums, as well as some other instruments. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification, idiophones are first categorized according to the method used to play the instrument. The result is four main categories: struck idiophones (11), plucked idiophones (12), friction idiophones (13), and blown idiophones (14). These groups are subsequently divided through various criteria. In many cases these sub-categories are split in singular specimens and sets of instruments. The latter category includes the xylophone, the marimba, the glockenspiel, and the glass harmonica.\n\nThese idiophones are set in vibration by being struck, for example cymbals or xylophones.\n\nThe player himself/herself executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc. It is definitive that the player can apply clear, exact, individual strokes, and that the instrument itself is equipped for this kind of percussion.\n\nThe player himself/herself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.\n\nPlucked idiophones, or lamellaphones, are idiophones set in vibration by being plucked; examples include the jaw harp or mbira. This group is sub-divided in the following two categories:\n\nThe lamellae vibrate within a frame or hoop.\n\nThe lamellae are tied to a board or cut out from a board like the teeth of a comb.\n\nIdiophones which are rubbed, for example the nail violin, a bowed instrument with solid pieces of metal or wood rather than strings.\n\n\n\n\nBlown idiophones are idiophones set in vibration by the movement of air, for example the Aeolsklavier, an instrument consisting of several pieces of wood which vibrate when air is blown onto them by a set of bellows. The piano chanteur features plaques.\n\n\n\nMembranophones primarily produce their sounds by means of the vibration of a tightly stretched membrane. This group includes all drums and kazoos. List of membranophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number\n\nStruck drums are instruments which have a struck membrane. This includes most types of drums, such as the timpani, or kettle drum, and the snare drum.\n\nInstruments in which the membrane is struck directly, such as through bare hands, beaters or keyboards.\n\nInstruments which are shaken, the membrane being vibrated by objects inside the drum (rattle drums).\n\nInstruments with a string attached to the membrane, so that when the string is plucked, the membrane vibrates (plucked drums).<br>\nSome commentators believe that instruments in this class ought instead to be regarded as chordophones (see below).\n\nInstruments in which the membrane vibrates as a result of friction. These are drums which are rubbed, rather than being struck.\n\nInstruments in which the membrane is vibrated from a stick that is rubbed or used to rub the membrane\n\nInstruments in which a cord, attached to the membrane, is rubbed.\n\nInstruments in which the membrane is rubbed by hand\n\nThis group includes kazoos, instruments which do not produce sound of their own, but modify other sounds by way of a vibrating membrane.\n\nInstruments in which the membrane is vibrated by an unbroken column of wind, without a chamber\n\nInstruments in which the membrane is placed in a box, tube or other container\n\nChordophones primarily produce their sounds by means of the vibration of a string or strings that are stretched between fixed points. This group includes all instruments generally called string instruments in the west, as well as many (but not all) keyboard instruments, such as pianos and harpsichords. List of chordophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number\n\nInstruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable, though it may result in quite a different sound being produced. They include the piano therefore, as well as other kinds of zithers such as the koto, and musical bows.\n\nThe string bearer is bar-shaped.\n\nThe string bearer is a vaulted surface.\n\nThe string bearer is composed of canes tied together in the manner of a raft.\n\nThe string bearer is a board.\n\nThe strings are stretched across the mouth of a trough.\n\nThe strings are stretched across an open frame.\n\nAcoustic and electro-acoustic instruments which have a resonator as an integral part of the instrument, and solid-body electric chordophones. This includes most western string instruments, including lute-type instruments such as violins and guitars, and harps.\n\nThe plane of the strings runs parallel with the resonator's surface.\n\nThe plane of the strings lies perpendicular to the resonator's surface.\n\nThe plane of the strings lies at right angles to the sound-table; a line joining the lower ends of the strings would be perpendicular to the neck. These have notched bridges.\n\nAerophones primarily produce their sounds by means of vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes. List of aerophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number\n\nInstruments in which the vibrating air is not contained within the instrument, for example sirens, or the bullroarer.\n\nThe air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip.\n\nThe air-stream is interrupted periodically.\n\nThe sound is caused by a single compression and release of air. Examples include the botija, the gharha, the ghatam, and the udu.\n\nThe vibrating air is contained within the instrument. This group includes most of the instruments called wind instruments in the west, such as the flute or French horn, as well as many other kinds of instruments such as conch shells.\n\nThe player makes a ribbon-shaped flow of air with his/her lips (421.1), or his/her breath is directed through a duct against an edge (421.2).\n\nThe player's breath is directed against a lamella or pair of lamellae which periodically interrupt the airflow and cause the air to be set in motion.\n\nThe player's vibrating lips set the air in motion.\n\n\nThe fifth top-level group, the electrophones category, was added by Sachs in 1940, to describe instruments involving electricity. Sachs broke down his 5th category into 3 subcategories: 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments; 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments; 53= instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators, such as theremins or synthesizers, which he called radioelectric instruments. Francis William Galpin provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs–Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin's 1937 book \"A Textbook of European Musical Instruments,\" he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation (\"by oscillation,\" \"electro-magnetic,\" and \"electro-static\"), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method. Sachs himself proposed subcategories 51, 52, and 53, on pages 447–467 of his 1940 book \"The History of Musical Instruments.\" However, the original 1914 version of the system did not acknowledge the existence of his 5th category.\n\nPresent-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p. 544), suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus it has been more recently proposed that, for example, the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, etc..\n\nBeyond the top three groups are several further levels of classification, so that the xylophone, for example, is in the group labeled 111.212 (periods are usually added after every third digit to make long numbers easier to read). A long classification number does not necessarily indicate the instrument is a complicated one. The valveless bugle for instance, has the classification number 423.121.22, even though it is generally regarded as a relatively simple instrument (it is basically a bent conical tube which you blow down like a trumpet, but it does not have valves or finger-holes). The numbers in the bugle's classification indicate the following:\n\n423.121.22 does not uniquely identify the bugle, but rather identifies the bugle as a certain kind of instrument which has much in common with other instruments in the same class. Another instrument classified as 423.121.22 is the bronze lur, an instrument dating back to the Bronze Age.\n\nAfter the number described above, a number of suffixes may be appended. An 8 indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a 9 indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, there are a number of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are plucked with fingers or plectrum, or played with a bow.\n\nThere are ways to classify instruments with this system even if they have elements from more than one group. Such instruments may have particularly long classification numbers with colons and hyphens used as well as numbers. Hornbostel and Sachs themselves cite the case of various bagpipes where some of the pipes are single reed (like a clarinet) and others are double reed (like the oboe). A number of similar composite instruments exist.\n\n\n"}

In 1992 this network became the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) with Shackleford becoming their first president.\n\nIn 1998 IAFFE was made an NGO with special consultative status to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC).\n\nBy 2003 IAFFE had more than five hundred members from over thirty countries. The association's president from 2003 to 2004 was Lourdes Benería. Shahra Razavi paid tribute to Benería in a speech at the IAFFE conference in 2012 describing Benería's work as, \"not only empirically grounded and conceptually informed, but also contributing to a feminist critique that is systemic and connected to a broader critique of capitalism\".\n\nIAFFE was awarded a grant of $1.5 million in 2010 from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), to continue their work, including the publication of special issues of \"Feminist Economics\". Since then the association has gone on to number six hundred members in sixty-four countries.\n\nAt the same time as IAFFE was setting up, a separate group of women, including Edith Kuiper, in the Netherlands organized a conference on feminist perspectives on economic theory called \"Out of the Margins\". The conference brought many like minded people together who continued to network with one another and be involved in groups and activism, sometimes involving the IAFFE. (Another small group of Dutch economists founded another organization named FENN, the Feminist Economics Network in the Netherlands). In 1998, at a second Amsterdam conference, arrangements were made to hold the first meeting of IAFFE European chapter.\n\nThe first official meeting of IAFFE Europe took place in Brussels in November 1998, there were twenty-five participants from ten countries and, as a result of the meeting, an e-mail list was created. Information about futures sessions and a report of the first meeting was sent to those interested, this led to more IAFFE panels (in 1999 and 2000) being organized for meetings of the European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE).\n\nThe European chapter of IAFFE continued to meet and Ailsa McKay, professor of economics at Glasgow Caledonian University, was its chair until her death in March 2014.\n\nThe \"Out of the Margins\" conference resulted in a network of contacts being formed, one of these networks gradually became the Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE), a chapter of IAFFE. The chapter includes a small feminist economics group in Wellington, New Zealand led by Prue Hyman.\n\nThe American chapter of IAFFE hold sessions at the American Economic Association's (AEA) annual meetings.\n\nIAFFE offer a prize scholarship in memory of former associate editor of \"Feminist Economics\" (1994–1998), Rhonda Williams. In 2014 the amount awarded was $1,500 to be given out at their summer conference to allow underrepresented groups in IAFFE attend the conference and present a paper.\n\nAward winners must demonstrate a commitment to one or more of the following issues: inequalities; interrelationships (racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism); and connections between scholarship and activism. Funding is provided by both Routledge and, Taylor & Francis.\n\nIAFFE takes part in Allied Social Sciences Association's (ASSA) annual conference every year. It also has its own annual conferences.\n\nThis is list of who is sitting on the board of IAFFE.\n\nThis is a list of presidents of the IAFFE.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "652038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652038", "title": "Language of thought hypothesis", "text": "Language of thought hypothesis\n\nThe language of thought hypothesis (LOTH), sometimes known as thought ordered mental expression (TOME), is a view in linguistics, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, forwarded by American philosopher Jerry Fodor. It describes the nature of thought as possessing \"language-like\" or compositional structure (sometimes known as \"mentalese\"). On this view, simple concepts combine in systematic ways (akin to the rules of grammar in language) to build thoughts. In its most basic form, the theory states that thought, like language, has syntax.\n\nUsing empirical data drawn from linguistics and cognitive science to describe mental representation from a philosophical vantage-point, the hypothesis states that thinking takes place in a language of thought (LOT): cognition and cognitive processes are only 'remotely plausible' when expressed as a system of representations that is \"tokened\" by a linguistic or semantic structure and operated upon by means of a combinatorial syntax. Linguistic tokens used in mental language describe elementary concepts which are operated upon by logical rules establishing causal connections to allow for complex thought. Syntax as well as semantics have a causal effect on the properties of this system of mental representations.\n\nThese mental representations are not present in the brain in the same way as symbols are present on paper; rather, the LOT is supposed to exist at the cognitive level, the level of thoughts and concepts. The LOTH has wide-ranging significance for a number of domains in cognitive science. It relies on a version of functionalist materialism, which holds that mental representations are actualized and modified by the individual holding the propositional attitude, and it challenges eliminative materialism and connectionism. It implies a strongly rationalist model of cognition in which many of the fundamentals of cognition are innate.\n\nThe hypothesis applies to thoughts that have propositional content, and is not meant to describe everything that goes on in the mind. It appeals to the representational theory of thought to explain what those tokens actually are and how they behave. There must be a mental representation that stands in some unique relationship with the subject of the representation and has specific content. Complex thoughts get their semantic content from the content of the basic thoughts and the relations that they hold to each other. Thoughts can only relate to each other in ways that do not violate the syntax of thought. The syntax by means of which these two sub-parts are combined can be expressed in first-order predicate calculus.\n\nThe thought \"John is tall\" is clearly composed of two sub-parts, the concept of John and the concept of tallness, combined in a manner that may be expressed in first-order predicate calculus as a predicate 'T' (\"is tall\") that holds of the entity 'j' (John). A fully articulated proposal for what a LOT would have to take into account greater complexities such as quantification and propositional attitudes (the various attitudes people can have towards statements; for example I might \"believe\" or \"see\" or merely \"suspect\" that John is tall).\n\n\nThe language of thought hypothesis has been both controversial and groundbreaking. Some philosophers reject the LOTH, arguing that our public language \"is\" our mental language—a person who speaks English \"thinks\" in English. But others contend that complex thought is present even in those who do not possess a public language (e.g. babies, aphasics, and even higher-order primates), and therefore some form of mentalese must be innate. \n\nThe notion that mental states are causally efficacious diverges from behaviorists like Gilbert Ryle, who held that there is no break between the cause of mental state and effect of behavior. Rather, Ryle proposed that people act in some way because they are in a disposition to act in that way, that these causal mental states are representational. An objection to this point comes from John Searle in the form of biological naturalism, a non-representational theory of mind that accepts the causal efficacy of mental states. Searle divides intentional states into low-level brain activity and high-level mental activity. The lower-level, nonrepresentational neurophysiological processes have causal power in intention and behavior rather than some higher-level mental representation.\n\nTim Crane, in his book \"The Mechanical Mind\", states that, while he agrees with Fodor, his reason is very different. A logical objection challenges LOTH’s explanation of how sentences in natural languages get their meaning. That is the view that “Snow is white” is TRUE if and only if \"P\" is TRUE in the LOT, where \"P\" means the same thing in LOT as “Snow is white” means in the natural language. Any symbol manipulation is in need of some way of deriving what those symbols mean. If the meaning of sentences is explained regarding sentences in the LOT, then the meaning of sentences in LOT must get their meaning from somewhere else. There seems to be an infinite regress of sentences getting their meaning. Sentences in natural languages get their meaning from their users (speakers, writers). Therefore, sentences in mentalese must get their meaning from the way in which they are used by thinkers and so on \"ad infinitum\". This regress is often called the homunculus regress.\n\nDaniel Dennett accepts that homunculi may be explained by other homunculi and denies that this would yield an infinite regress of homunculi. Each explanatory homunculus is “stupider” or more basic than the homunculus it explains, but this regress is not infinite but bottoms out at a basic level that is so simple that it does not need interpretation. John Searle points out that it still follows that the bottom-level homunculi are manipulating some sorts of symbols.\n\nLOTH implies that the mind has some tacit knowledge of the logical rules of inference and the linguistic rules of syntax (sentence structure) and semantics (concept or word meaning). If LOTH cannot show that the mind knows that it is following the particular set of rules in question, then the mind is not computational because it is not governed by computational rules. Also, the apparent incompleteness of this set of rules in explaining behavior is pointed out. Many conscious beings behave in ways that are contrary to the rules of logic. Yet this irrational behavior is not accounted for by any rules, showing that there is at least some behavior that does not act by this set of rules.\n\nAnother objection within representational theory of mind has to do with the relationship between propositional attitudes and representation. Dennett points out that a chess program can have the attitude of “wanting to get its queen out early,” without having representation or rule that explicitly states this. A multiplication program on a computer computes in the computer language of 1’s and 0’s, yielding representations that do not correspond with any propositional attitude.\n\nSusan Schneider has recently developed a version of LOT that departs from Fodor's approach in numerous ways. In her book, The Language of Thought: a New Philosophical Direction, Schneider argues that Fodor's pessimism about the success of cognitive science is misguided, and she outlines an approach to LOT that integrates LOT with neuroscience. She also stresses that LOT that is not wedded to the extreme view that all concepts are innate. She fashions a new theory of mental symbols, and a related two-tiered theory of concepts, in which a concept's nature is determined by its LOT symbol type and its meaning.\n\nConnectionism is an approach to artificial intelligence that often accepts a lot of the same theoretical framework that LOTH accepts, namely that mental states are computational and causally efficacious and very often that they are representational. However, connectionism stresses the possibility of thinking machines, most often realized as artificial neural networks, an inter-connectional set of nodes, and describes mental states as able to create memory by modifying the strength of these connections over time. Some popular types of neural networks are interpretations of units, and learning algorithm. \"Units\" can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons. A learning algorithm is such that, over time, a change in connection weight is possible, allowing networks to modify their connections. Connectionist neural networks are able to change over time via their activation. An activation is a numerical value that represents any aspect of a unit that a neural network has at any time. Activation spreading is the spreading or taking over of other over time of the activation to all other units connected to the activated unit.\n\nSince connectionist models can change over time, supporters of connectionism claim that it can solve the problems that LOTH brings to classical AI. These problems are those that show that machines with a LOT syntactical framework very often are much better at solving problems and storing data than human minds, yet much worse at things that the human mind is quite adept at such as recognizing facial expressions and objects in photographs and understanding nuanced gestures. Fodor defends LOTH by arguing that a connectionist model is just some realization or implementation of the classical computational theory of mind and therein necessarily employs a symbol-manipulating LOT.\n\nFodor and Zenon Pylyshyn use the notion of cognitive architecture in their defense. Cognitive architecture is the set of basic functions of an organism with representational input and output. They argue that it is a law of nature that cognitive capacities are productive, systematic and inferentially coherent—they have the ability to produce and understand sentences of a certain structure if they can understand one sentence of that structure. A cognitive model must have a cognitive architecture that explains these laws and properties in some way that is compatible with the scientific method. Fodor and Pylyshyn say that cognitive architecture can only explain the property of systematicity by appealing to a system of representations and that connectionism either employs a cognitive architecture of representations or else does not. If it does, then connectionism uses LOT. If it does not then it is empirically false.\n\nConnectionists have responded to Fodor and Pylyshyn by denying that connectionism uses LOT, by denying that cognition is essentially a function that uses representational input and output or denying that systematicity is a law of nature that rests on representation.\n\nSince LOTH came to be it has been empirically tested. Not all experiments have confirmed the hypothesis;\n\n\n\n\n"}

The line at infinity is also called the ideal line.\n\nIn projective geometry, any pair of lines always intersects at some point, but parallel lines do not intersect in the real plane. The line at infinity is added to the real plane. This completes the plane, because now parallel lines intersect at a point which lies on the line at infinity. Also, if any pair of lines intersect at a point on the line at infinity, then the pair of lines are parallel.\n\nEvery line intersects the line at infinity at some point. The point at which the parallel lines intersect depends only on the slope of the lines, not at all on their y-intercept.\n\nIn the affine plane, a line extends in two opposite directions. In the projective plane, the two opposite directions of a line meet each other at a point on the line at infinity. Therefore, lines in the projective plane are closed curves, i.e., they are cyclical rather than linear. This is true of the line at infinity itself; it meets itself at its two endpoints (which are therefore not actually endpoints at all) and so it is actually cyclical.\n\nThe line at infinity can be visualized as a circle which surrounds the affine plane. However, diametrically opposite points of the circle are equivalent—they are the same point. The combination of the affine plane and the line at infinity makes the real projective plane, formula_1.\n\nA hyperbola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in two different points. These two points are specified by the slopes of the two asymptotes of the hyperbola. Likewise, a parabola can be seen as a closed curve which intersects the line at infinity in a single point. This point is specified by the slope of the axis of the parabola. If the parabola is cut by its vertex into a symmetrical pair of \"horns\", then these two horns become more parallel to each other further away from the vertex, and are actually parallel to the axis and to each other at infinity, so that they intersect at the line at infinity.\n\nThe analogue for the complex projective plane is a 'line' at infinity that is (naturally) a complex projective line. Topologically this is quite different, in that it is a Riemann sphere, which is therefore a 2-sphere, being added to a complex affine space of two dimensions over \"C\" (so four \"real\" dimensions), resulting in a four-dimensional compact manifold. The result is orientable, while the real projective plane is not.\n\nThe complex line at infinity was much used in nineteenth century geometry. In fact one of the most applied tricks was to regard a circle as a conic constrained to pass through two points at infinity, the solutions of\n\nThis equation is the form taken by that of any circle when we drop terms of lower order in \"X\" and \"Y\".

Since the projective plane has a large enough symmetry group, they are in no way special, though. The conclusion is that the three-parameter family of circles can be treated as a special case of the linear system of conics passing through two given distinct points \"P\" and \"Q\". \n\n"}

During a lucid dream, one may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment.\n\nThe term 'lucid dream' was coined by Dutch author and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden in his 1913 article \"A Study of Dreams\", though descriptions of dreamers being aware that they are dreaming predates the actual term. Frederik Van Eeden studied his personal dreams since 1896. He wrote down the most interesting ones and out of all these dreams, 352 were what we know now as “lucid dreams”. Throughout all the data he collected from dreaming, he created different names for different types of dreams. He named 7 different types of dreams; Initial dreams, pathological, ordinary dreaming, vivid dreaming, demoniacal, general- dream-sensations, and lastly lucid dreaming. Frederick Van Eeden said the seventh type of dreaming, lucid dreaming, was the most interesting and worthy of the most careful observation of study. Eeden studied lucid dreaming between January 20, 1898 through December 26, 1912. In this state of dreaming Eeden explains that you are completely aware of your surroundings and are able to direct your actions freely, yet the sleep is stimulating and uninterrupted.\n\nEarly references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek writing. For example, the philosopher Aristotle wrote: 'often when one is asleep, there is something in consciousness which declares that what then presents itself is but a dream'. Meanwhile, the physician Galen of Pergamon used lucid dreams as a form of therapy. In addition, a letter written by Saint Augustine of Hippo in 415 AD tells the story of a dreamer, Doctor Gennadius, and refers to lucid dreaming.\nIn Eastern thought, cultivating the dreamer's ability to be aware that he or she is dreaming is central to both the Tibetan Buddhist practice of dream Yoga, and the ancient Indian Hindu practice of Yoga nidra. The cultivation of such awareness was common practice among early Buddhists.\n\nPhilosopher and physician Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682) was fascinated by dreams and described his own ability to lucid dream in his \"Religio Medici\", stating: '...yet in one dream I can compose a whole Comedy, behold the action, apprehend the jests and laugh my self-awake at the conceits thereof'.\n\nAlso, Samuel Pepys in his diary entry for 15 August 1665 records a dream, stating: \"I had my Lady Castlemayne in my arms and was admitted to use all the dalliance I desired with her, and then dreamt that this could not be awake, but that it was only a dream\".\n\nIn 1867, the French sinologist Marie-Jean-Léon, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys anonymously published \"Les Rêves et Les Moyens de Les Diriger; Observations Pratiques\" ('Dreams and the ways to direct them; practical observations'), in which he describes his own experiences of lucid dreaming, and proposes that it is possible for anyone to learn to dream consciously.\n\nIn 1913, Dutch psychiatrist and writer Frederik (Willem) van Eeden (1860–1932) coined the term 'lucid dream' in an article entitled \"A Study of Dreams\".\n\nSome have suggested that the term is a misnomer because van Eeden was referring to a phenomenon more specific than a lucid dream. Van Eeden intended the term lucid to denote \"having insight\", as in the phrase \"a lucid interval\" applied to someone in temporary remission from a psychosis, rather than as a reference to the perceptual quality of the experience, which may or may not be clear and vivid.\n\nIn 1968, Celia Green analyzed the main characteristics of such dreams, reviewing previously published literature on the subject and incorporating new data from participants of her own. She concluded that lucid dreams were a category of experience quite distinct from ordinary dreams, and said they were associated with rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). Green was also the first to link lucid dreams to the phenomenon of false awakenings.\n\nLucid dreaming was subsequently researched by asking dreamers to perform pre-determined physical responses while experiencing a dream, including eye movement signals. \n\nIn 1980, Stephen LaBerge at Stanford University developed such techniques as part of his doctoral dissertation. In 1985, LaBerge performed a pilot study that showed that time perception while counting during a lucid dream is about the same as during waking life. Lucid dreamers counted out ten seconds while dreaming, signaling the start and the end of the count with a pre-arranged eye signal measured with electrooculogram recording. LaBerge's results were confirmed by German researchers D. Erlacher and M. Schredl in 2004.\n\nIn a further study by Stephen LaBerge, four subjects were compared either singing while dreaming or counting while dreaming. LaBerge found that the right hemisphere was more active during singing and the left hemisphere was more active during counting.\n\nNeuroscientist J. Allan Hobson has hypothesized what might be occurring in the brain while lucid. The first step to lucid dreaming is recognizing one is dreaming. This recognition might occur in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is one of the few areas deactivated during REM sleep and where working memory occurs. Once this area is activated and the recognition of dreaming occurs, the dreamer must be cautious to let the dream continue but be conscious enough to remember that it is a dream. While maintaining this balance, the amygdala and parahippocampal cortex might be less intensely activated. To continue the intensity of the dream hallucinations, it is expected the pons and the parieto-occipital junction stay active.\n\nUsing electroencephalography (EEG) and other polysomnographical measurements, LaBerge and others have shown that lucid dreams begin in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stage of sleep. LaBerge also proposes that there are higher amounts of beta-1 frequency band (13–19 Hz) brain wave activity experienced by lucid dreamers, hence there is an increased amount of activity in the parietal lobes making lucid dreaming a conscious process.\n\nPaul Tholey, a German Gestalt psychologist and a professor of psychology and sports science, originally studied dreams in order to answer the question if one dreams in colour or black and white. In his phenomenological research, he outlined an epistemological frame using critical realism. Tholey instructed his probands to continuously suspect waking life to be a dream, in order that such a habit would manifest itself during dreams. He called this technique for inducing lucid dreams the \"Reflexionstechnik\" reflection technique. Probands learned to have such lucid dreams; they observed their dream content and reported it soon after awakening. Tholey could examine the cognitive abilities of dream figures. Nine trained lucid dreamers were directed to set other dream figures arithmetic and verbal tasks during lucid dreaming. Dream figures who agreed to perform the tasks proved more successful in verbal than in arithmetic tasks. Tholey discussed his scientific results with Stephen LaBerge, who has a similar approach.\nOther researchers suggest that lucid dreaming is not a state of sleep, but of brief wakefulness, or \"micro-awakening\". Experiments by Stephen LaBerge used \"perception of the outside world\" as a criterion for wakefulness while studying lucid dreamers, and their sleep state was corroborated with physiological measurements. LaBerge's subjects experienced their lucid dream while in a state of REM, which critics felt may mean that the subjects are fully awake. J Allen Hobson responded that lucid dreaming must be a state of both waking and dreaming.\n\nPhilosopher Norman Malcolm has argued against the possibility of checking the accuracy of dream reports, pointing out that \"the only criterion of the truth of a statement that someone has had a certain dream is, essentially, his saying so.\"\n\nPaul Tholey laid the epistemological basis for the research of lucid dreams, proposing seven different conditions of clarity that a dream must fulfill in order to be defined as a lucid dream:\n\nLater, in 1992, a study by Deirdre Barrett examined whether lucid dreams contained four \"corollaries\" of lucidity:\nBarrett found less than a quarter of lucidity accounts exhibited all four.\n\nSubsequently, Stephen LaBerge studied the prevalence of being able to control the dream scenario among lucid dreams, and found that while dream control and dream awareness are correlated, neither requires the other. LaBerge found dreams that exhibit one clearly without the capacity for the other; also, in some dreams where the dreamer is lucid and aware they could exercise control, they choose simply to observe.\n\nIn 2016, a meta-analytic study by David Saunders and colleagues on 34 lucid dreaming studies, taken from a period of 50 years, demonstrated that 55% of a pooled sample of 24,282 people claimed to have experienced lucid dreams at least once or more in their lifetime. Furthermore, for those that stated they did experience lucid dreams, approximately 23% reported to experience them on a regular basis, as often as once a month or more. \n\nIt has been suggested that sufferers of nightmares could benefit from the ability to be aware they are indeed dreaming. A pilot study was performed in 2006 that showed that lucid dreaming therapy treatment was successful in reducing nightmare frequency. This treatment consisted of exposure to the idea, mastery of the technique, and lucidity exercises. It was not clear what aspects of the treatment were responsible for the success of overcoming nightmares, though the treatment as a whole was said successful.\n\nAustralian psychologist Milan Colic has explored the application of principles from narrative therapy to clients' lucid dreams, to reduce the impact not only of nightmares during sleep, but also depression, self-mutilation, and other problems in waking life. Colic found that therapeutic conversations could reduce the distressing content of dreams, while understandings about life—and even characters—from lucid dreams could be applied to their lives with marked therapeutic benefits.\n\nPsychotherapists have applied lucid dreaming as a part of therapy. Studies have shown that by inducing a lucid dream recurrent nightmares can be alleviated. It is unclear whether this alleviation is due to lucidity or the ability to alter the dream itself. A 2006 study performed by Victor Spoormaker and Van den Bout evaluated the validity of lucid dreaming treatment (LDT) in chronic nightmare sufferers. LDT is composed of exposure, mastery and lucidity exercises. Results of lucid dreaming treatment revealed that the nightmare frequency of the treatment groups had decreased. In another study, Spoormaker, Van den Bout, and Meijer (2003) investigated lucid dreaming treatment for nightmares by testing eight subjects who received a one-hour individual session, which consisted of lucid dreaming exercises. The results of the study revealed that the nightmare frequency had decreased and the sleep quality had slightly increased.\n\nHolzinger, Klösch, and Saletu managed a psychotherapy study under the working name of ‘Cognition during dreaming – a therapeutic intervention in nightmares’, which included 40 subjects, men and women, 18–50 years old, whose life quality was significantly altered by nightmares. The test subjects were administered Gestalt group therapy and 24 of them were also taught to enter the state of lucid dreaming by Holzinger. This was purposefully taught in order to change the course of their nightmares. The subjects then reported the diminishment of their nightmare prevalence from 2–3 times a week to 2–3 times per month.\n\nIn her book \"The Committee of Sleep\", Deirdre Barrett describes how some experienced lucid dreamers have learned to remember specific practical goals such as artists looking for inspiration seeking a show of their own work once they become lucid or computer programmers looking for a screen with their desired code. However, most of these dreamers had many experiences of failing to recall waking objectives before gaining this level of control.\n\nSome movies like \"Inception\" refer to the concept of lucid dreaming.\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

If \"z\" is a point in \"D\" such that \nfor all \"z\" in a neighborhood of \"z\", then the function \"f\" is constant on \"D\".\n\nBy switching to the reciprocal, we can get the minimum modulus principle. It states that if \"f\" is holomorphic within a bounded domain \"D\", continuous up to the boundary of \"D\", and non-zero at all points, then |\"f\"(z)| takes its minimum value on the boundary of \"D\".\n\nAlternatively, the maximum modulus principle can be viewed as a special case of the open mapping theorem, which states that a nonconstant holomorphic function maps open sets to open sets. If |\"f\"| attains a local maximum at \"z\", then the image of a sufficiently small open neighborhood of \"z\" cannot be open. Therefore, \"f\" is constant.\n\nOne can use the equality\n\nfor complex natural logarithms to deduce that ln |\"f\"(\"z\")| is a harmonic function. Since \"z\" is a local maximum for this function also, it follows from the maximum principle that |\"f\"(\"z\")| is constant. Then, using the Cauchy–Riemann equations we show that \"\"(\"z\") = 0, and thus that \"f\"(\"z\") is constant as well. Similar reasoning shows that |\"f\"| can only have a local minimum (which necessarily has value 0) at an isolated zero of \"f(z)\".\n\nAnother proof works by using Gauss's mean value theorem to \"force\" all points within overlapping open disks to assume the same value. The disks are laid such that their centers form a polygonal path from the value where \"f\"(\"z\") is maximized to any other point in the domain, while being totally contained within the domain. Thus the existence of a maximum value implies that all the values in the domain are the same, thus \"f\"(\"z\") is constant.\n\nA physical interpretation of this principle comes from the heat equation. That is, since log |\"f\"(\"z\")| is harmonic, it is thus the steady state of a heat flow on the region \"D\". Suppose a strict maximum was attained on the interior of \"D\", the heat at this maximum would be dispersing to the points around it, which would contradict the assumption that this represents the steady state of a system.\n\nThe maximum modulus principle has many uses in complex analysis, and may be used to prove the following:\n\n"}

The IRP provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of areas, including:\n\nMetals were an early priority for the International Resource Panel, since little was known about them, their impacts, their economic importance or their scarcity. The report aimed to calculate the amount of metals present in society and assess the potential for utilising in-use stock to offset demand from virgin metal. Knowing how much metal stock there is in use, and how long the lifespan of the metal is, can help planners know when these metal stocks will enter recycling or waste streams. It suggested that these 'mines above ground' had growing potential for future metals supply; the authors found that there is about 50 kg of above-ground copper for every person on earth, and more than two tons of iron per capita. However, they noted that enormous disparities in global metals stocks existed between developed and developing nations including Brazil, China and India.\n\nCalculating ‘anthropogenic stocks’ of metals already in use in society is a precursor to stimulating efforts to increase recycling. The authors reported that very little information is presently known about different metals, making it difficult for policy makers to develop and plan recycling systems. However, what is known is that recycling can not only reduce negative impacts on the environment but also save energy. For example, 95% of the energy used to make aluminium from bauxite ore is saved by using recycled material.\n\nThe authors quantified per capita stocks of the following metals, for some countries (stocks were mostly quantified for developed countries but data was also available for some developing nations).\n\nExtant in-use metal-stock estimations for the major engineering metals:\n\nSome primary stocks of rare but useful metals are already running low. For example, rhenium only occurs at seven parts per billion in the Earth’s crust, making it one of the rarest elements on the planet. However, its high melting point of 3,186 °C makes it valuable in the manufacture of jet engines. Demand for the metal is rising, with increasing air travel, but its rarity means increasing extraction is not simple. This is where recycling comes in; rhenium is one of the few metals that has witnessed a rise in recycling rates. It is likely that recycling will become a more viable option than extraction for other metals in future, saving energy, cutting greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere and reducing negative impacts on the environment.\n\n"}

The opposing candidates were Walram of Moers and Eric of Hoya. They were supported by their families with Count John of Hoya and Archbishop Dietrich II of Moers at their respective heads. In addition, there were also external allies. Within the diocese the \"Stände\", namely the cathedral chapter and the town of Münster, played an independent role at times. In the end neither candidate was able to succeed to the office.\nThe Diocese of Münster was one of the largest and most important ecclesial territories in the northwest German area. In the Late Middle Ages the bishop's thrones in the region were predominantly filled by members of comital families or the families of hereditary noblemen (\"Edelherren\"). These families, like the counts of the Mark, attempted to secure episcopal seats for their sons. Even less powerful families took the opportunity to increase their influence, at least occasionally, over an ecclesial territory. To this group belonged the lords of Lippe, who occupied the bishop's throne in Paderborn several times. The counts of Hoya were successful in the Bishopric of Osnabrück. In the Bishopric of Minden this was true of the houses of Diepholz and Schaumburg. In the mid-15th century, however, the counts of Moers were foremost in this regard. Especially after Dietrich of Moers had become Archbishop of Cologne, the family was able to secure the majority of the bishop's seats in the northwest German area. Their main rival in the Bishopric of Münster was the Hoya family.\n\nInternally, some of the prince-bishops, most recently Otto IV of Hoya, had expanded their territory and got rid of smaller internal lordships. By contrast it was clear that the bishops in the 13th and 14th centuries had largely lost control of their capital, Münster. The city acted independently almost as if it were a rich imperially immediate city. In addition, the \"Stände\", the cathedral chapter, knights and towns had gained influence and sharply reduced the power of the bishops.\n\nAfter the death of Bishop Otto IV, Dietrich of Moers succeeded in getting his brother, Henry II of Moers, into the Münster bishopric against the will of the city of Münster. After the archbishop, due to internal diocesan disputes, had secured the Bishopric of Osnabrück for Erich of Hoya, he placed Henry there as administrator. He oriented his policy sharply towards his brother's interests and supported him strongly during the Feud of Soest. The House of Hoya, who also held the bishoprics of Verden and Minden, saw the counts of Moers as intruders in their own area of interest. Apart from the Archdiocese of Cologne, Münster and Osnabrück, the House of Moers ruled Paderborn and parts of the Bishopric of Utrecht. The warlike stance of Henry in supporting his brother did not help the diocese, rather it resulted in a sharp increase in its debt and a decline in prosperity.\n\nWithin the diocese, the estates were in open revolt by Henry's death. From now on, the aspirations of the House of Moers ran into resistance. Despite that, Dietrich did everything possible to continue to occupy Münster with a member of his family. As a successor he had provided his brother Walram of Moers, but this brought him into conflict with the House of Hoya. John of Hoya had not forgotten that Dietrich of Moers was exchanged for members of his family. In particular, he had not forgotten his own six years imprisonment in connection with the fighting around Osnabrück. He wanted to make his brother, Erich of Hoya, successor.\n\nIn addition to the two main rivals for the episcopacy, there were other contenders. The town of Osnabrück strongly supported Conrad of Diepholz. He was the cathedral provost (\"Dompropst\") in Osnabrück and a nephew of the Bishop of Utrecht, Rudolph of Diepholz. He supported the candidacy, but arrived too late to actively promote his nephew.\n\nDietrich of Moers gave away large bribes to win a majority in the cathedral chapter for his brother. He had, until recently been a supporter of the Council of Basel, before he changed sides to the Roman curia. Dietrich succeeded in getting the majority of the cathedral chapter on side at a meeting in Hausdülmen on 15 July 1450. But John of Hoya campaigned for his brother, Erich. He won over the citizens of the city of Münster and the nobility to his cause. Within the city he was mainly supported by the guilds and the commoners, while the hereditary patricians on the council did not want confrontation.\n\nJohn of Hoya was elected by the secular estates as the diocesan administrator (\"Stiftsverweser\"). He was to officiate until the Pope had appointed a bishop acceptable to both citizens and lords. In a letter to the Pope they explained their reasons for this unusual procedure were that Walram was allegedly responsible for two murders as well as other crimes in the past. By contrast, Erich of Hoya had led a supposedly blameless life and had had an academic education. A minority of thirteen canons and all the clergy of the city supported this position. In Osnabrück, John of Hoya, succeeded his brother Albert of Hoya to become the administrator. Thus, the position of the family was further strengthened in the battle for the Diocese of Münster.\n\nAs administrator, John of Hoya brought most of Münster's royal castles (\"Landesburgen\") under his control. In order to reduce his own costs as far as possible, he seized the estates of the bishop and income of the cathedral canons (\"Domherren\"). In addition, he introduced an excise duty on trade goods. The supporters of Walram in the cathedral chapter were prepared to negotiate in this eventuality. An agreement was reached that the Hoyas largely honoured, according to which at the next \"Landtag\" all the estates would appeal to the Pope to award the office of bishop to Erich of Hoya. In return the canons were guaranteed their former rights and income. The \"Landtag\" approved this arrangement.\nIn January 1451, John of Hoya captured Dülmen Castle which had opposed him. Meanwhile, in ignorance of the unanimous support of the estates for Hoya, Pope Pope Nicholas V had appointed Walram of Moers as bishop. The town of responded to this by asking for a legal opinion from the University of Erfurt. Their judgement was that the estates did not have to accept the decision of the Pope because the Pope would not have known of Walram's unsuitability for the post.\n\nThe Hoya family were also supported by the Duchy of Cleves. Duke John of Cleves hoped thereby to weaken the power of the Archbishop of Cologne. On 11 June 1451, the Treaty of Haus Dülmen was signed, sealing an alliance between Cleves and John of Hoya. As a reward for his support in the battle against Walram of Moers Cleves was given the estates of Dülmen and Stromberg. Cleves was not just a valuable military ally. Also important was his advocacy through Philip of Burgundy, an uncle of the duke, in Rome. Following the signing of the treaty, Cleves declared war on Walram of Moers.\n\nOn the same day news arrived in Münster that Emperor Frederick III had conferred the regalia on Walram. After Walram had also received Papal confirmation, he removed several of his opponents from their high church offices and had the supporters of his opponent placed under a Papally-ordained interdict. Those affected appealed again to the University of Erfurt. The university judged the measures taken by Walram and the Archbishop of Cologne to be invalid. Philip of Burgundy intervened on behalf of the Hoya faction, writing a letter to Rome. Before taking any further steps, Rome decided to wait and see what position Nicholas of Cusa would take in this case.\n\nMeanwhile, in the diocese, the feud broke out in the form of smaller operations. Most of the upper diocese was subsequently dominated by the Hoya faction; Walram only possessed the area around Ahaus, Vreden and Ottenstein.\n\nNicholas of Cusa was probably expected to instruct the Pope to replace both the earlier episcopal candidates with Conrad of Diepholz. Nicholas of Cusa, however, expressed opposition to the Hoyas. With the fall of Vreden, Walram also lost his last town in the Diocese of Moers. He notified Cusa on 21 January 1452 of his willingness to renounce the bishopric, provided it was possible to remove keep the Hoyas out and to make Conrad of Diepholz bishop instead.\n\nThe latter was supported \"inter alia\" by his uncle, Bishop Rudolph of Utrecht. From now on the Hoyas encountered increasingly strong military action, for example at the Siege of Ahaus. At the start of 1452 a mercenary arm defeated Hoya and the Münster troops and took large numbers of prisoners. On 2 February the supporters of Diepholz declared a feud against their opponents. Walram pledged the latter the remaining settlements he owned - Ahaus and Ottenstein - to Rudolph of Utrecht. In the diocese itself, sympathy grew for Conrad of Diepholz, whose candidature appeared to be an increasingly attractive alternative to the former aspirants. The estates sought therefore, on 6 October 1452 in Coesfeld, to reach a compromise, in order to get rid of both Walram of Moers and Erich of Hoya. All episcopal decisions since the death of Bishop Henry were declared null and void. In any case, these peace attempts failed. One reason was probably that John of Cleves continued to support Erich of Hoya.\n\nJohn of Hoya, who had previously left the town, returned to Münster. Supported by the lower levels of the town of Münster, John of Hoya transferred the diocesan regency in 1453 \"de jure\" to his brother Erich, so that the latter could prove himself as regent. Although the mayors of the towns opposed this, they eventually had to accept it under pressure from their townsfolk. Erich of Hoya was thereupon rendered homage in all the towns.\n\nThis pitched the conflict into a new phase. Rudolph of Utrecht declared a feud against the town of Münster and its three allies on 7 July 1453. He succeeded in capturing the town of Vreden which, shortly thereafter was retaken by John of Hoya. Rudolph of Utrecht took advantage of disputes in the enemy camp and took a number of towns. Against the background of the triumphant advance of his opponent, in 1454 John of Hoya forced the re-election of the town council in Münster which was sympathetic to his cause. The majority of the council came from the guilds and the common people, only a few hereditary patricians (\"Erbmänner\") were represented. In Münster resistance to the harsh rule of the Hoyas started to increase. Moreover, in October 1454, the Hansetag demanded the restoration of the old council constitution.\n\nThe allies around Walram of Moers and the Bishop of Utrecht managed to obtain assurances from the Pope, that all complaints from the opposite side to the Pope about spiritual penalties imposed by Walram were invalid. Those who aligned themselves with Walram were assured that they would receive absolution from any excommunication. Coesfeld was the first town to take advantage of the offer. This became the Walram's residence.\n\nBecause John of Cleves was temporarily unable to provide support due to his wedding, John of Hoya turned to Duke Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg with a request for assistance. With his help John of Hoya attacked, plundering and destroying, the area of Coesfeld and the County of Bentheim, which supported his enemies. Walram and Dietrich initially lacked the means to defend themselves against it. In July, a body of troops belonging to the archbishop arrived in Dülmen. Through a tactical mistake by Count John of Hoya, Duke Frederick's troops were alone when an allied army led by Dietrich of Moers, Walram of Moers, Rudolph of Utrecht, Bernard II of Bentheim, Bernard of Lippe and Conrad of Diepholz attacked and inflicted a crushing defeat on their opponents in the Battle of Varlar. The Duke was captured. One more vigorous attack might have brought total success, but the allies were hampered by internal disputes.\n\nJohn of Hoya noticed that the mood in Münster was turning against him. He offered to transfer all the towns and castles to Cleves. But John of Cleves now had other plans. He wanted to give the diocese to Simon of Lippe, while Eric of Hoya was to get the Diocese of Osnabrück. He thus hoped that this would help to expel Bishop Rudolph from Utrecht. A short time later the latter died after he had ceded his rights to Ahaus and Ottenstein to Conrad of Diepholz. With his death, the allies of the House of Moers and Conrad of Diepholz lost their strongest supporter. The latter became Bishop of Osnabrück, but did not give up his aim of becoming the bishop in Münster as well.\n\nIn the Diocese of Münster, Walram of Moers continued to be opposed by John of Hoya. However, Dietrich of Moers did not pursue the matter with any great effort. So the fighting continued in the form of a minor war. In addition, negotiations took place which led to no result. One major success in early 1456 was the conquest of Coesfeld by John of Hoya. Then, in October 1456, Walram of Moers died in Arnhem. John of Hoya now relied on the support of the Duke of Burgundy. On behalf of Eric of Hoya he appealed for support to Pope Callistus III, who was hoping that Burgundy would help him win the Ottoman Wars. The strong support of Philip of Burgundy for Hoya's cause meant that the towns now aligned themselves more firmly on the side of John of Hoya than they had in recent years. Eric of Hoya was proposed as bishop by two of the canons. However, the majority of the canons chose Conrad of Diepholz. Both sides asked Rome for a decision.\n\nJohn of Hoya sought to strengthen his position in Münster by obtained citizenship in early 1457 and joining the Blacksmiths' Guild. A short time later he was elected to the Council. However, the Pope decided upon John of Palatinate-Simmern, who had been totally uninvolved in the previous disputes. John of Hoya looked in vain to the support of Cleves and Burgundy once more. But even Conrad of Diepholz's aspiration to maintain his position failed.\n\nOn 23 October 1457 the Treaty of Kranenburg was signed that ended the conflict. It stipulated that Eric of Hoya should receive a lifetime income equivalent to that of the Cologne provost office. The city of Münster undertook to recognize the new bishop, to allow him to enter the town and to pay homage to him. In return, the new bishop agreed to recognize the existing privileges of the town. The new bishop also recognized the enfeoffment of the estates of Dülmen and Stromberg to the Duke of Cleves. The latter also received compensation of 11,000 Rhenish guilders. In early November, the new bishop arrived in Münster, swore the oath of office and the electoral capitulation.\n\nEarlier, John of Hoya had secretly left the town. Eric of Hoya died in 1458. Bevergern Castle which had been enfeoffed to him was returned to the diocese. After the peace treaty, life in the diocese quickly returned to normal. The dominant position that the patrician's (\"Erbmänner\") had long held on Münster's town council was broken, as the guilds secured the right to be represented by their members. The \"Erbmänner\" only had half of the Council. In the end it was clear that the diocese had just become an object in the power game between noble families. The Emperor and Pope had lost any real influence. In the era of Henry and Walrams of Moers, some of the bishops had virtually lost any sense of their calling in faith to serve God and neighbour, but were simply out for themselves.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2109530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2109530", "title": "Narrative logic", "text": "Narrative logic\n\nNarrative logic describes any logical process of narrative analysis used by readers or viewers to understand and draw conclusions from narratives. Narrative logic is a tool through which the audience may infer actions, events, intentions, thoughts, beliefs, values, and feelings of characters and narrators, or otherwise elucidate details not included in the narrative. For example, if a character is in Paris in one scene and in Nice the next, the audience can infer that she traveled, and later references to that travel will not be illogical or unexplainable simply because the trip was not explicitly described. In the same way, if a gun is shown in the drawer of a character's desk, the audience can infer that the gun will be or has been used in some way relevant to the plot. Authors will often play with conventional patterns of narrative logic by attempting to plant \"false leads\" or to hide important clues, leading audiences to improper conclusions or even to doubt their sense of what is really happening.\n\nIt is necessary to build a logical argument based upon the content of a narrative, using its events and rhetoric as evidence to infer other elements necessary to produce a coherent and consistent plot, theme, and argument. This is done to ensure that one's argument does not contradict or alter the narrative itself. Problems and disagreements may arise from this fixity of the narrative because it should also preclude alteration of the artistic statement being conveyed, something that is open to subjective interpretation and may be paradoxical or illogical in itself. Thus, this process is generally imperfect since, as with all narrative analysis and most forms of logic, different applications and interpretations can lead to differing conclusions.\n\nNarrative logic becomes explicit or even labored to create continuity where there is a plot hole or some intentional gap in a narrative, or to explain other unresolved issues within a narrative (i.e. questions such as \"Did this character die or simply disappear?\" or \"Why did two instances under the same circumstances lead to different results?\"). It may also be used for other purposes, such as answering theoretical questions derived from the narrative (i.e. \"What would happen if...?\" or \"Who would win in a battle between...?\"). In a broader sense it is used in devices such as character development, since a character is defined by the interpretations of its actions and the rhetoric used to describe it.\n\nConsider the question of what happens to the character of Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) in this movie. At the end of the movie a shot is shown of each of the characters on the Bride's kill list with a caption telling the fate of the character. For Elle Driver the caption reads \"???,\" director Quentin Tarantino seemingly leaving it up to the audience to decide. Using narrative logic, we take all relevant information from the narrative and come to a conclusion about Driver's fate. Driver is last depicted thrashing about in a trailer, having been blinded by the Bride. This trailer is also occupied by a deadly black mamba, a fact that is emphasized when it is shown poised to strike as the Bride leaves the trailer. Logically, a thrashing, blind woman and threatened snake occupying a confined space would lead most to conclude that Driver falls prey to the snake and is dead at the end of the film. This conclusion may be further supported by taking into consideration the film's rhetorical and artistic devices. The film is largely a tale of deadly vengeance, and the other targets of the Bride are known to be dead at the film's end, thus the ending is better rounded by assuming Driver to likewise be dead. Also, the Bride's codename is Black Mamba, and this same snake killed another of the Bride's targets, so if one presumes the snake is a rhetorical extension of the Bride's wrath, it would most likely strike Driver down while she is vulnerable.\nHowever, one may also argue that Driver survived. Again, this conclusion can be supported with logic and analysis of the movie's narrative. The strongest evidence may be the very fact that Driver's fate is left open to question. Another point is that, despite blindness, Driver is still a highly trained professional who would not easily succumb to death by a small reptile.\n\nThis example shows how the application of narrative logic may lead to different conclusions using the same evidence. However, these conclusions are similar in that they do not detract from the narrative itself, but only build upon it.\n"}
{"id": "6432722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6432722", "title": "Photon polarization", "text": "Photon polarization\n\nPhoton polarization is the quantum mechanical description of the classical polarized sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave. An individual photon\ncan be described as having right or left circular polarization, or a superposition of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical linear polarization, or a superposition of the two.\n\nThe description of photon polarization contains many of the physical concepts and much of the mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well. Polarization is an example of a qubit degree of freedom, which forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as state vectors, probability amplitudes, unitary operators, and Hermitian operators, emerge naturally from the classical Maxwell's equations in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the Jones vector, usually used to describe the polarization of a classical wave. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the conservation of energy of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state.\n\nMany of the implications of the mathematical machinery are easily verified experimentally. In fact, many of the experiments can be performed with two pairs (or one broken pair) of polaroid sunglasses.\n\nThe connection with quantum mechanics is made through the identification of a minimum packet size, called a photon, for energy in the electromagnetic field. The identification is based on the theories of Planck and the interpretation of those theories by Einstein. The correspondence principle then allows the identification of momentum and angular momentum (called spin), as well as energy, with the photon.\n\nThe wave is linearly polarized (or plane polarized) when the phase angles\nformula_1 are equal,\n\nThis represents a wave with phase formula_3 polarized at an angle formula_4 with respect to the x axis. In that case the Jones vector can be written\n\nThe state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.\n\nIf unit vectors are defined such that\n\nand\n\nthen the linearly polarized polarization state can be written in the \"x-y basis\" as\n\nIf the phase angles formula_9 and formula_10 differ by exactly formula_11 and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude the wave is circularly polarized. The Jones vector then becomes\n\nwhere the plus sign indicates right circular polarization and the minus sign indicates left circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the x-y plane.\n\nIf unit vectors are defined such that\n\nand\n\nthen an arbitrary polarization state can be written in the \"R-L basis\" as\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nWe can see that\n\nThe general case in which the electric field rotates in the x-y plane and has variable magnitude is called elliptical polarization. The state vector is given by\n\nTo get an understanding of what a polarization state looks like, one can observe the orbit that is made if the polarization state is multiplied by a phase factor of formula_20 and then having the real parts of its components interpreted as x and y coordinates respectively. That is:\n\nIf only the traced out shape and the direction of the rotation of is considered when interpreting the polarization state, i.e. only\n\n(where and are defined as above) and whether it is overall more right circularly or left circularly polarized (i.e. whether or vice versa), it can be seen that the physical interpretation will be the same even if the state is multiplied by an arbitrary phase factor, since\n\nand the direction of rotation will remain the same. In other words, there is no physical difference between two polarization states formula_24 and formula_25, between which only a phase factor differs.\n\nIt can be seen that for a linearly polarized state, M will be a line in the xy plane, with length 2 and its middle in the origin, and whose slope equals to . For a circularly polarized state, M will be a circle with radius and with the middle in the origin.\n\nThe energy per unit volume in classical electromagnetic fields is (cgs units) and also Planck unit\n\nFor a plane wave, this becomes\n\nwhere the energy has been averaged over a wavelength of the wave.\n\nThe fraction of energy in the x component of the plane wave is\n\nwith a similar expression for the y component resulting in formula_29.\n\nThe fraction in both components is\n\nThe momentum density is given by the Poynting vector\n\nFor a sinusoidal plane wave traveling in the z direction, the momentum is in the z direction and is related to the energy density:\n\nThe momentum density has been averaged over a wavelength.\n\nElectromagnetic waves can have both orbital and spin angular momentum. The total angular momentum density is\n\nFor a sinusoidal plane wave propagating along formula_34 axis the orbital angular momentum density vanishes. The spin angular momentum density is in the formula_34 direction and is given by\n\nwhere again the density is averaged over a wavelength.\n\nA linear filter transmits one component of a plane wave and absorbs the perpendicular component. In that case, if the filter is polarized in the x direction, the fraction of energy passing through the filter is\n\nAn ideal birefringent crystal transforms the polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. Birefringent crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum tools such as unitary and Hermitian operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge.\n\nA birefringent crystal is a material that has an optic axis with the property that the light has a different index of refraction for light polarized parallel to the axis than it has for light polarized perpendicular to the axis. Light polarized parallel to the axis are called \"\"extraordinary rays\" or \"extraordinary photons\", while light polarized perpendicular to the axis are called \"ordinary rays\" or \"ordinary photons\"\". If a linearly polarized wave impinges on the crystal, the extraordinary component of the wave will emerge from the crystal with a different phase than the ordinary component. In mathematical language, if the incident wave is linearly polarized at an angle formula_38 with respect to the optic axis, the incident state vector can be written\n\nand the state vector for the emerging wave can be written\n\nWhile the initial state was linearly polarized, the final state is elliptically polarized. The birefringent crystal alters the character of the polarization.\n\nThe initial polarization state is transformed into the final state with the operator U. The dual of the final state is given by\n\nwhere formula_42 is the adjoint of U, the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix.\n\nThe fraction of energy that emerges from the crystal is\n\nIn this ideal case, all the energy impinging on the crystal emerges from the crystal. An operator U with the property that\n\nwhere I is the identity operator and U is called a unitary operator. The unitary property is necessary to ensure energy conservation in state transformations.\n\nIf the crystal is very thin, the final state will be only slightly different from the initial state. The unitary operator will be close to the identity operator. We can define the operator H by\n\nand the adjoint by\n\nEnergy conservation then requires\n\nThis requires that\n\nOperators like this that are equal to their adjoints are called Hermitian or self-adjoint.\n\nThe infinitesimal transition of the polarization state is\n\nThus, energy conservation requires that infinitesimal transformations of a polarization state occur through the action of a Hermitian operator.\n\nThe treatment to this point has been classical. It is a testament, however, to the generality of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics that the treatment can be made quantum mechanical with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities. The reinterpretation is based on the theories of Max Planck and the interpretation by Albert Einstein of those theories and of other experiments.\n\nEinstein's conclusion from early experiments on the photoelectric effect is that electromagnetic radiation is composed of irreducible packets of energy, known as photons. The energy of each packet is related to the angular frequency of the wave by the relation\n\nwhere formula_51 is an experimentally determined quantity known as Planck's constant. If there are formula_52 photons in a box of volume formula_53, the energy in the electromagnetic field is\n\nand the energy density is\n\nThe photon energy can be related to classical fields through the correspondence principle which states that for a large number of photons, the quantum and classical treatments must agree. Thus, for very large formula_52, the quantum energy density must be the same as the classical energy density\n\nThe number of photons in the box is then\n\nThe correspondence principle also determines the momentum and angular momentum of the photon. For momentum\n\nwhere kz is the wave number. This implies that the momentum of a photon is\n\nSimilarly for the spin angular momentum\n\nwhere Ec is field strength. This implies that the spin angular momentum of the photon is\n\nthe quantum interpretation of this expression is that the photon has a probability of formula_63 of having a spin angular momentum of formula_64 and a probability of formula_65 of having a spin angular momentum of formula_66. We can therefore think of the spin angular momentum of the photon being quantized as well as the energy. The angular momentum of classical light has been verified. Photons have only been observed to have spin angular momenta of formula_67.\n\nThe spin of the photon is defined as the coefficient of formula_64 in the spin angular momentum calculation. A photon has spin 1 if it is in the formula_69 state and -1 if it is in the formula_70 state. The spin operator is defined as the outer product\n\nThe eigenvectors of the spin operator are formula_72 and formula_73 with eigenvalues 1 and -1, respectively.\n\nThe expected value of a spin measurement on a photon is then\n\nAn operator S has been associated with an observable quantity, the spin angular momentum. The eigenvalues of the operator are the allowed observable values. This has been demonstrated for spin angular momentum, but it is in general true for any observable quantity.\n\nWe can write the circularly polarized states as\n\nwhere s=1 for formula_76 and s= -1 for formula_77.

The former interpretation violates energy conservation. The latter interpretation is the viable, if nonintuitive, option. Dirac explains this in the context of the double-slit experiment:\nSome time before the discovery of quantum mechanics people realized that the connection between light waves and photons must be of a statistical character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave function gives information about the probability of one photon being in a particular place and not the probable number of photons in that place. The importance of the distinction can be made clear in the following way. Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large number of photons split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the beam is connected with the probable number of photons in it, we should have half the total number going into each component. If the two components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the two components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs.<br>—Paul Dirac, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1\n\nThe probability for a photon to be in a particular polarization state depends on the fields as calculated by the classical Maxwell's equations. The polarization state of the photon is proportional to the field. The probability itself is quadratic in the fields and consequently is also quadratic in the quantum state of polarization. In quantum mechanics, therefore, the state or probability amplitude contains the basic probability information. In general, the rules for combining probability amplitudes look very much like the classical rules for composition of probabilities: [The following quote is from Baym, Chapter 1]\n\nFor any legal operators the following inequality, a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, is true.\n\nIf \"B A\" ψ and \"A B\" ψ are defined, then by subtracting the means and re-inserting in the above formula, we deduce\nwhere\n\nis the operator mean of observable \"X\" in the system state ψ and\n\nHere\n\nis called the commutator of A and B.\n\nThis is a purely mathematical result. No reference has been made to any physical quantity or principle. It simply states that the uncertainty of one operator times the uncertainty of another operator has a lower bound.\n\nThe connection to physics can be made if we identify the operators with physical operators such as the angular momentum and the polarization angle. We have then\n\nwhich simply states that angular momentum and the polarization angle cannot be measured simultaneously with infinite accuracy.\n\nMuch of the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics appears in the classical description of a polarized sinusoidal electromagnetic wave. The Jones vector for a classical wave, for instance, is identical with the quantum polarization state vector for a photon. The right and left circular components of the Jones vector can be interpreted as probability amplitudes of spin states of the photon. Energy conservation requires that the states be transformed with a unitary operation. This implies that infinitesimal transformations are transformed with a Hermitian operator. These conclusions are a natural consequence of the structure of Maxwell's equations for classical waves.\n\nQuantum mechanics enters the picture when observed quantities are measured and found to be discrete rather than continuous. The allowed observable values are determined by the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the observable. In the case angular momentum, for instance, the allowed observable values are the eigenvalues of the spin operator.\n\nThese concepts have emerged naturally from Maxwell's equations and Planck's and Einstein's theories. They have been found to be true for many other physical systems. In fact, the typical program is to assume the concepts of this section and then to infer the unknown dynamics of a physical system. This was done, for instance, with the dynamics of electrons. In that case, working back from the principles in this section, the quantum dynamics of particles were inferred, leading to Schrödinger's equation, a departure from Newtonian mechanics. The solution of this equation for atoms led to the explanation of the Balmer series for atomic spectra and consequently formed a basis for all of atomic physics and chemistry.\n\nThis is not the only occasion in which Maxwell's equations have forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's equations are relativistically consistent. Special relativity resulted from attempts to make classical mechanics consistent with Maxwell's equations (see, for example, Moving magnet and conductor problem).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1272337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1272337", "title": "Pity", "text": "Pity\n\nPity is a sympathetic sorrow evoked by the suffering of others and is used in a comparable sense to \"compassion\", \"condolence\" or \"empathy\". Through frequent, insincere, pejorative usage, it is used to connote feelings of superiority, condescension, or contempt.\n\nThe word \"pity\" comes from the Latin \"pietās\", that is also etymon of \"piety\".\n\nThe word is often used in the translations from ancient Greek into English of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" and \"Rhetoric\". Aristotle argued (Rhetoric 2.8) that before a person can feel pity for another human, the person must first have experienced suffering of a similar type, and the person must also be somewhat distanced or removed from the sufferer. In Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" he defines pity as follows: \"Let pity, then, be a kind of pain in the case of an apparent destructive or painful harm of one not deserving to encounter it, which one might expect oneself, or one of one's own, to suffer, and this when it seems near\". Aristotle also pointed out that \"people pity their acquaintances, provided that they are not exceedingly close in kinship; for concerning these they are disposed as they are concerning themselves...For what is terrible is different from what is pitiable, and is expulsive of pity\". Thus, from Aristotle's perspective, in order to feel pity, a person must believe that the person who is suffering does not deserve their fate. Developing a traditional Greek view in his work on poetry, Aristotle also defines tragedy as a kind of imitative poetry that provokes pity and fear. \n\nThe religious concept of pity was reinforced in the West after the acceptance of Judeo-Christian concepts of God by the proposition of a deity which felt pity for all humanity. Consistent references to the concept of God's pity can be found in the older Jewish tradition. The Hebrew word \"Hesed\" translated in the LXX by \"Eleos\" carries the meaning roughly equivalent to pity in the sense of compassion, mercy and loving-kindness. (See The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 698a.) By the nineteenth century, two different kinds of pity had come to be distinguished, which we might call \"benevolent pity\" and \"contemptuous pity\" (see Kimball). David Hume observed that pity which has in it a strong mixture of good-will, is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. Pity is an emotion that almost always results from an encounter with a real or perceived unfortunate, injured, or pathetic creature. Jean-Jacques Rousseau had the following opinion of pity as opposed to love for others: \"It is therefore certain that pity is a natural sentiment, which, by moderating in every individual the activity of self-love, contributes to the mutual preservation of the whole species. It is this pity which hurries us without reflection to the assistance of those we see in distress; it is this pity which, in a state of nature, stands for laws, for manners, for virtue, with this advantage, that no one is tempted to disobey her sweet and gentle voice: it is this pity which will always hinder a robust savage from plundering a feeble child, or infirm old man, of the subsistence they have acquired with pain and difficulty, if he has but the least prospect of providing for himself by any other means: it is this pity which, instead of that sublime maxim of argumentative justice, Do to others as you would have others do to you, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness a great deal less perfect, but perhaps more useful, Consult your own happiness with as little prejudice as you can to that of others. It is in a word, in this natural sentiment, rather than in fine-spun arguments, that we must look for the cause of that reluctance which every man would experience to do evil, even independently of the maxims of education.\" \n\nA person experiencing pity will experience a combination of intense sorrow and mercy for the person or creature, often giving the pitied some kind of aid, physical help, and/or financial assistance. Nietzsche, however, pointed out that since all people to some degree value self-esteem and self-worth, pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be psychologically harmful to the pitied: Self-pity and depression can sometimes be the result of the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for the pitied party.\n\nThough in his later works he reverses his position and sees Pity as an emotion that can draw beings together, Mystic poet William Blake is known to have been ambivalent about the emotion Pity. In The Book of Urizen Pity begins when Los looks on the body of Urizen bound in chains (Urizen 13.50–51). However, Pity furthers the fall, \"For pity divides the soul\" (13.53), dividing Los and Enitharmon (Enitharmon is named Pity at her birth). Analyzers of this work assert that Blake shows that \"Pity defuses the power of righteous indignation and proper prophetic wrath that lead to action. Pity is a distraction; the soul is divided between it and the action a 'pitiable' state demands. This is seen as Los's division into active male and tearful female, the latter deluding the former.\" Again railing against Pity in \"The Human Abstract\", Blake exclaims: \"Pity would be no more, / If we did not make somebody Poor\" (1–2).\n\nModern neurology asserts that pity consists of an initial aversion to the plight of the sufferer, after which the higher parts of the brain make a more nuanced assessment of the situation (e.g., considering the context and invoking empathy, etc.).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20044858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20044858", "title": "Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil", "text": "Predictions made by Ray Kurzweil\n\nAmerican author, inventor and futurist Raymond Kurzweil has become well known for his predictions about artificial intelligence and the human species, mainly concerning the Technological Singularity. He predicts that Artificial Intelligence would outsmart the human brain in computational capabilities by mid-21st century. His first book, \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", published in 1990, put forth his theories on the results of the increasing use of technology and predicted the explosive growth in the internet, among other predictions. Later works, 1999's \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" and 2005's \"The Singularity is Near\" outlined other theories including the rise of clouds of nano-robots (nanobots) called foglets and the development of Human Body 2.0 and 3.0, whereby nanotechnology is incorporated into many internal organs.\n\nKurzweil's first book, \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", was published in 1990. It forecast the demise of the already crumpling Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information. In 2005, Mikhail Gorbachev told Kurzweil that emerging decentralized electronic communication \"was a big factor\" for fostering democracy in the Soviet Union.\n\nKurzweil extrapolated the performance of chess software to predict that computers would beat the best human players \"by the year 2000\". In May 1997 chess World Champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue computer in a well-publicized chess tournament.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\", there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world, and the medium was often unreliable outside academic, military, corporate and other heavily invested settings, difficult for non-technical users to use, and mostly lacking a broad range of content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access \"to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services\". Additionally, Kurzweil correctly foresaw that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\", which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil believes the world will experience over the next century. Titled \"To Face the Future\", the section is divided into four chapters respectively named \"2009\", \"2019\", \"2029\", and \"2099\". For every chapter, Kurzweil issues predictions about what life and technology will be like in that year.\n\nKurzweil restated his earlier prediction from \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\" regarding the advent of pocket-sized, cheap, text-to-speech converters for the blind by 2009. The \"Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader\" (K-NFB Reader) was introduced in 2005 at a price of $3,495. The device was portable, but not the cheap, pocket-sized device of the prediction. By 2008, a software version for the (pocket-sized) Nokia N82 smartphone was available for $1,595. A version for iOS phones was released for $99 in 2014 and Android for $75 in 2015.\n\nWhile this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as \"The Age of Intelligent Machines\" and \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" did, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in \"The Singularity Is Near\", though longer-term visions abound.\n\nKurzweil predicted that, in 2005, supercomputers with the \"computational capacities\" to simulate protein folding will be introduced. In 2010, a supercomputer simulated protein folding for a very small protein at an atomic level over a period of a millisecond. The protein folded and unfolded, with the results closely matching experimental data.\nThe biyearly protein structure prediction contest CASP shows that the current algorithms for structure prediction are still impractical for determining the previously unknown structure of most proteins.\n\nIn an October 2002 article published on his website, Kurzweil stated that \"Deep Fritz-like chess programs running on ordinary personal computers will routinely defeat all humans later in this decade.\" Deep Fritz is a computer chess program—generally considered superior to the older Deep Blue — that has defeated or tied a number of human chess masters and opposing chess programs. Due to advances in personal computer performance, the Deep Fritz program can now run on ordinary personal computers, and different versions of it are available for purchase. In September 2002, \"Chessmaster 9000\", a widely available chess playing game from Ubisoft, defeated the then U.S. Chess Champion and International Grandmaster Larry Christiansen in a four-game match. In 2006 reigning World Champion Vladimir Kramnik was defeated 4:2 by Deep Fritz, running on a multiprocessor personal computer.\n\nAccording to Ray Kurzweil, 89 out of 108 predictions he made were entirely correct by the end of 2009. Kurzweil later released a more detailed analysis of the accuracy of his predictions up to 2009, arguing that most were correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzweil has even wagered that his predictions will be true, on the site Long Bets Betting against Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Software Corporation for a payout of $20,000, or $10,000 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 terabytes of storage (not memory) have been already reached for $535 (Seagate Barracuda 10TB) in mid 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKurzweil said in a 2006 C-SPAN2 interview that \"nanotechnology-based\" flying cars would be available in 20 years.\n\nKurzweil has said that by 2014, humanity will reach a \"tipping point\" where the cost-per-watt from solar energy is cheaper than from coal and oil: By capturing only 0.03 percent of the sun's energy that falls on Earth, humanity could meet virtually all of its projected energy needs up to 2030 (thirty trillion watts); this will be capable through with extremely inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient nano-engineered solar panels together with nano-fuel cells to store and distribute the captured energy. Kurzweil believes, by the end of the 2020s, humans will be able to completely replace fossil fuels.\n\nKurzweil has said that by the 2030s, people will be able to send nano-bots into their brains through their capillaries. The nano-bots will take up positions in close physical proximity to each interneuronal connection coming from each physical sense and cause the firing of neurons to result in full-immersion virtual reality, similar to the way psychedelic drugs alter consciousness. The nano-bots will also allow people to \"connect their neocortex to the cloud\". This technology is based on “neuron transistors” developed by scientists at the Max Planck Institute that can control the firing of neurons.\n\nKurzweil said the following in a November 2007 \"Computerworld\" interview:\n\nIn the cover article of the December 2010 issue of \"IEEE Spectrum\", John Rennie criticized Kurzweil's predictions: \"On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable.\"\n"}
{"id": "29529070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29529070", "title": "Social construction of gender", "text": "Social construction of gender\n\nThe social construction of gender is a notion in feminism and sociology about the operation of gender and gender differences in societies. According to this view, society and culture create gender roles, and these roles are prescribed as ideal or appropriate behavior for a person of that specific sex. \n\nSome supporters of this idea argue that the differences in behavior between men and women are entirely social conventions, whereas others believe that behavior is influenced by universal biological factors to varying degrees, with social conventions having a major effect on gendered behavior.\n\nThe roots of the social constructionist movement in psychology are related to the criticism of the objectivism assumed by positivist/empiricist concepts of knowledge (Gergen, 1985).\nAmong the most popular variations of the social constructionist theories is the gender role theory, considered by Alsop, Fitzsimons and Lennon (2002) as an early form of social constructionism.\nThe focus on power and hierarchy reveals inspiration stemming from a Marxist framework, utilized for instance by materialist feminism, and Foucault's writings on discourse.\nSocial constructionism, briefly, is the concept that there are many things that people \"know\" or take to be \"reality\" that are at least partially, if not completely, socially situated. For example, Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker writes that \"some categories really are social constructions: they exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist. Examples include money, tenure, citizenship, decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\"\n\nThe basic assumptions of social constructionism, as described by Marecek, Crawford & Popp, are:\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either essentialist or non-essentialist. This means that some of these theories assume a clear biological division between women and men when considering the social creation of masculinity and femininity, while other contest the assumption of the biological division between the sexes as independent of social construction.\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not a personal trait; it is \"an emergent feature of social situations: both as an outcome of and a rationale for various social arrangements, and as a means of legitimating one of the most fundamental divisions of society.\" Historically, the term gender was adopted as means of distinguishing between biological sex and socialized aspects of femininity and masculinity. Moreover, gender was considered achieved and more or less stable after it is acquired in early childhood. Contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, proposes treating gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute our belonging to a sex as based on the socially accepted dichotomy of \"women\" and \"men\". It is noted, however, that these activities are not always perceived (by the audience) as being either \"masculine\" or \"feminine\", they are at constant risk of being assessed as more or less \"womanly\" or \"manly\"; ultimately, any behavior may be judged based upon its \"manly\" or \"womanly\" nature. \"Doing gender\" is in fact based on these interactions that are constituted of ongoing assessments in various situations. This in turn points to the situational nature of gender rather than its inherent, essentialist and individual nature.\n\nGender roles are often centred around the conceptions of femininity or masculinity. In our society today, women are socialized as being the caretakers of the house, who nurture the children, cook and clean. With men, they \"should\" be the workhorse, the provider, protector, a leader, and a teacher to his family.\n\nEmpirical investigations suggest that gender roles are \"social constructs that vary significantly across time, context, and culture\". Ronald F. Levant and Kathleen Alto write: \n\nA study in 2017 found that health risks are set by the behaviors that are instilled in males and females by the time they're 10 or 11.\n\nGender roles, according to Berkowitz, are an acceptance of social construction as it pertains to gender and the roles we perform. \"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".\n\nThe constructionism of gender and stereotyped roles can be examined through a given environment. A certain gendered patriarchy turns abstraction into material reality. This reality is negotiated into each interaction we have. For example, based on a simulation discussed in “Walk Like a Man, Talk Like a Woman”, the simulation used “demonstrates the social constructiveness of gender, maintaining that gender should be conceptualized and portrayed as a process, system of stratification, and social structure”. The perceptions of the social world in which these students view the world around them is as an “objective reality rather than as a product of human interaction and interpretation that is institutionalized and transformed over time”. One of the most powerful notions that this simulation encourages is teaching from a constructionist perspective that requires instructors to “challenge perceptions by requiring students to unpack the “hows and whys” of sociological phenomena”.\n\nLisa M. Diamond argues that gender identity is not a stable, fixed trait – rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual. A study by Bandura and Bussey shows that kids want to be like others of their sex. Social conformity has been widely studied on adolescents. Results showed that 6-year-old children tend to conform to choices that their peers find more popular. They begin labeling objects as \"for girls\" or \"for boys\" and conform to what is expected of them. West and Zimmerman argue that the notion of womanhood or femininity is accomplished through an active process of creating gender through interacting with others in a particular social context. Society typically only recognizes two genders. Therefore, when transgender individuals want to have a sex change operation, they must prove that they can \"pass\" as a man or woman – so even the choice of changing one's gender is socially constructed.\n\nIn recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is dealing with their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality. The authors characterize this style of representation as \"Homonormative,\" and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a transman or that they were simply pretending.\n\nDiamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviews with sexual minority women over the course of ten years. One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine \"stance\" and started to question her gender identity. When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.\n\nThe perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender. Heterosexuality is assumed for those individuals who appear to act appropriately masculine or appropriately feminine. If one wants to be perceived as a lesbian, one must first be perceived as a woman; if one wants to be seen as a gay man, one has to be seen as a man.\n\nThe sense of one's gender identity is acquired through the internalization of external knowledge. However, it is in fact never fully acquired – it has to be constantly performed and reenacted in social interactions. According to Alsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon, \"Gender is part of an identity woven from a complex and specific social whole, and requiring very specific and local readings\". Thus, gender identity can be defined as part of socially situated understanding of gender. LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.\n\nThe way gender is constructed for an individual depends on gendered interactions the individual has with others as well as other identities or roles he or she may have. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not ALL identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done. Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways. Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\". For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have with white women. White women are accountable for their gendered display as traditionally subservient to white men while women of color may be held accountable for their gendered performance as sexual objects and as recalcitrant and bawdy women in relations with white men. West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does – it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\". People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. \"Doing\" gender is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles – it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent – roles are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\". The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives. In other words, individual perceptions of \"\"knowledge\" or reality...must be the central focus.\"\n\nThese performances normalize the essentialism of sex categories. In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender – that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained – \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\". In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior. This can be said for constructions of any identity in certain contexts (e.g. femininity, race, Black femininity, etc.).\n\nPeople hold themselves and each other accountable for their presentations of gender (how they 'measure up'). They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life. Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate – it is the \"possibility\" of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a machismo masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations – for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession – gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious. For instance, gender is maintained before the woman enters the male-dominated group through conceptions of masculinity.\n\nRace, class, and other oppressions can also be omnirelevant categories, though they are not \"all\" identically salient in every set of social relationships in which inequality is done. People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.). This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context. Gender is created in different ways among uneducated and educated African Americans.\n\nWest and Zimmerman give this definition for sex in their paper \"Doing Gender\": \"Sex is a determination made through the application of socially agreed upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females and males. The criteria for classification can be genitalia at birth or chromosomal typing before birth, and they do not necessarily agree with one another\". The differentiation between gender and sex did not arise until the late 1970s, when researchers began using \"gender\" and \"sex\" as two separate terms, with \"gender\" referring to one's self-identity and \"sex\" referring to one's chromosomal makeup and sex organs. The binary of male and female leaves out everyone who does not fit into these categories because of genital make up, chromosomes, or hormone levels. Anne Fausto-Sterling addresses the issues facing intersex people in her article \"The Five Sexes\". She claims that there is at minimum five sexes but probably more; this is based on the vast range of ways bodies show up in nature. She points out that, \"recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most intersexuals at birth...infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management...\" This highlights the intense adherence to the binary instead of allowing bodies to present in the world without intervention.\n\nWest and Zimmerman also give a definition for sex category: \"achieved through application of the sex criteria, but in everyday life, categorization is established and sustained by the socially required identificatory displays that proclaim one's membership in one or the other category\". Sex category is applied to a person in everyday life through commonly recognized cues that are not necessarily fulfilling biological criteria of sex.\n\nThe term \"gender performativity\" was first coined in American philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's 1990 book \"\". In \"Gender Trouble\", Butler sets out to criticize what she considers to be an outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance—that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\". In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way…To say that gender is performative is a little different…For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman…we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\" Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler states that \"there is no 'being' behind doing… 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed – the deed is everything.\" Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in drag performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of gender binaries in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\". Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\".\n\nAmelia Jones proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the gaze and sexual fetishism, which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\". Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine. In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled \"Language and Gender\", states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\". Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\". Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\", that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from Sigmund Freud's notion of melancholia, such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys…\". This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted. Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance. \n\nThe Butlerian model presents a queer perspective on gender performance and explores the possible intersection between socially constructed gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality. This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim as heteronormative, contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings. This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as ACT UP during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired.\n\nQueer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as \"failure\" on the part of their character. Instead of recognizing these instances as moral or psychological failures, this concept frames them as the resultants of a conflict between a person's sexuality and their gender.\n\nButler suggests that \"[t]he critical promise of drag does not have to do with the proliferation of genders…but rather with the exposure of the failure of heterosexual regimes ever fully to legislate or contain their own ideals\", although such remarks fail to indicate how the inadequacies of heterosexual regimes might be explicitly exposed. \n\nAccording to Butler, gender performance is only subversive because it is \"the kind of effect that resists calculation\", which is to say that signification is multiplicitous, that the subject is unable to control it, and so subversion is always occurring and always unpredictable. Moya Lloyd suggests that the political potential of gender performances can be evaluated relative to similar past acts in similar contexts in order to assess their transgressive potential: \"Even if we accept that there are incalculable effects to all (or most) statements or activities, this does not mean that we need to concede that there are no calculable effects.\" Conversely, Rosalyn Diprose lends a hard-line Foucauldian interpretation to her understanding of gender performance's political reach, as one's identity \"is built on the invasion of the self by the gestures of others, who, by referring to other others, are already social beings\". Diprose implies that the individual's will, and the individual performance, is always subject to the dominant discourse of an Other (or Others), so as to restrict the transgressive potential of performance to the inscription of simply another dominant discourse.\n\nMartha Nussbaum criticizes Butler's concepts of gender performativity as a misguided retreat from engaging with real-world concerns:\n\n\"Butler suggests to her readers that this sly send-up of the \"status quo\" is the only script for resistance that life offers [...] Butlerian feminism is in many ways easier than the old feminism. It tells scores of talented young women that they need not work on changing the law, or feeding the hungry, or assailing power through theory harnessed to material politics. They can do politics in safety of their campuses, remaining on the symbolic level, making subversive gestures at power through speech and gesture. This, the theory says, is pretty much all that is available to us anyway, by way of political action, and isn't it exciting and sexy?\"\n\nGender features strongly in most societies and is a significant aspect of self-definition for most people. One way to analyze the social influences that affect the development of gender is through the perspective of the social cognitive theory. According to Kay Bussey, social cognitive theory describes \"how gender conceptions are developed and transformed across the life span\". The social cognitive theory views gender roles as socially constructed ideas that are obtained over one's entire lifetime. These gender roles are \"repeatedly reinforced through socialization\". Hackman verifies that these gender roles are instilled in us from \"the moment we are born\". For the individual, gender construction starts with assignments to a sex category on the basis of biological genitalia at birth. Following this sexual assignment, parents begin to influence gender identity by dressing children in ways that clearly display this biological category. Therefore, biological sex becomes associated with a gender through naming, dress, and the use of other gender markers. Gender development continues to be affected by the outlooks of others, education institutions, parenting, media, etc. These variations of social interactions force individuals to \"learn what is expected, see what is expected, act and react in expected ways, and thus simultaneously construct and maintain the gender order\".\n\nIn high schools, gender-based harassment serves as a form of gender boundary policing. Girls are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are boys. Both male and female students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to machismo that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys. Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls. This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. The way in which girls harass other girls is through gossiping, instead of confronting the other girls directly. Unique appearances and attempts to stand out among girls are regarded very negatively. This type of female on female bullying sets the standard for appearance norms and the importance of appearance for females. Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of high school students by high school students.\n\nGender is a cultural construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints. Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear gender differences because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\". With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls. Crocket and Beal in their article \"The Life Course in the Making: Gender and the Development of Adolescents\", \"gender differences in the anticipated timing of future role transitions, the impact of expectations and values on these expected timings, and the extent to which expectations foreshadow actual behavior\". The actions of a youth in high school greatly impact the choices the individual will have over a lifetime. Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of motherhood.\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to Jack Halberstam (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \"maleness and to power to domination”, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy. In a 2015 study published in the \"American Journal of Public Health\", researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship”. These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.\n\nAdolescents view on adulthood is also determined by their employment in high school. Many boys work during high school and \"unlike young women, young men who had not worked during high school did not quite match their peers\". Because many other boys are working, those who don't work may not be as successful after graduation. In the book \"Working and Growing Up in America\", Jeylan T. Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more vocationally successful after leaving high school\". This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school. This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to \"cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems\". One of these psychological problems is depression. While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is psychological well-being. Negriff and Susman explain in their article \"Pubertal Timing, Depression, and Externalizing Problems\" that \"the same hormones that increase during puberty are also related to depression and aggressive tendencies. Higher levels of testosterone are associated with increased aggression in boys and girls, whereas higher estrogen for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms\". The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15–18 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem. In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression. Self-esteem is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed. Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image. With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. Depression can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of self-esteem issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school.\n\nHigh school is a major transitional period for girls and boys as their bodies transition into men and women. The end of high school is usually marked by the 18th birthday, a major milestone in an individual's life. Boys and girls go through this transformation within high school where each gender faces body satisfaction differently. There are many different factors that affect body image, \"including sex, media, parental relationship, and puberty as well as weight and popularity\". The intersectionality of these factors causes unique experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to psychological well-being during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction. Helen Winfield in her article \"Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type\" explains an adolescences high school experience is closely linked to their perceived body image. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found \"ratings of physical attractiveness and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15–18 years because of pubertal changes\". This shift during the high school years can cause serious psychological problems for adolescence. These psychological problems can manifest as bulimia and anorexia causing serious lifelong problems. These body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter puberty expectations of height and muscle mass change as well. Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article \"Body image in boys: A review of the literature\" argue \"girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger\". This, they argue, shows the gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals. An adolescent's gender affects their body image and their high school experience.\n\nDue to the amount of time that children spend in school, \"teachers are influential role models for many aspects of children's educational experiences, including gender socialization\". Teachers who endorse the culturally dominant gender-role stereotype regarding the distribution of talent between males and females distort their perception of their students' mathematical abilities and effort resources in mathematics, in a manner that is consistent with their gender-role stereotype and to a greater extent than teachers who do not endorse the stereotype.\n\nAccording to the 1994 report \"\" by the American Psychological Association, \"[m]ost standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.\" Differences have been found, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures. Even within mathematics, it is noted that significant differences in performance as a result of gender do not occur until late in high school, a result of biological differences, the exhibition of stereotypes by teachers, and the difference in chosen coursework between individual students. While, on average, boys and girls perform similarly in math, boys are over represented among the very best performers as well as the very worst. Teachers have found that when certain types of teaching (such as experiments that reflect daily life), work for girls, they generally work for boys as well.\n\nAlthough little difference in mathematics performance was found among younger students, a study of students grade 1-3 by Fennema et al. noted that significant differences in problem-solving strategies were found, with girls tending to use more standard algorithms than the boys. They suggest that this may be due to both the teachers' stereotypical beliefs about mathematics and gender, as well as the study's design permitting \"the children's stereotypical beliefs to influence strategy use and thus the development of understanding in these classrooms\". A study conducted at Illinois State University examined the effects of gender stereotypes on the teaching practices of three third grade teachers, noting that \"[the teachers] claimed gender neutrality, yet they expressed numerous beliefs about gender difference during the study\", such as allowing boys (but not girls) to respond to questions without raising their hand or providing reading selections that promoted women in non-traditional roles, but not doing the same for men.\n\nOverall, differences in student performance that arise from gender tend to be smaller than that of other demographic differences, such as race or socioeconomic class. The results of the 1992 NAEP 12th grade science tests, on a 500-point scale, show that the differences of scores between white and African American students were around 48 points, while differences between male and female students were around 11 points.\n\nSocial gender construction (specifically for younger audiences) is also influenced by media. In the 21st century, modern technology is abundant in developed countries. In 2018, roughly 42% of tweens and teens experience feelings of anxiety when not near their phones. There is a growing amount of teens that spend an average of 6.5 hours on media daily. This data reflects how much of a teenager's personality is dependent on media. Media influencing gender construction can be seen in advertising, social networking, magazines, television, music, and music videos. \n\nThese platforms can affect how a developing human views themselves and those around them. There is both positive and negative media and each type can be perceived differently. Media will often portray men and women in a stereotypical manner, reflecting their \"ideal image\" for society. These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers.\n\nMen are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men. Women are typically represented as the backbone of the household, the caretaker, and often even as stay at home mothers. Females in media are often given weak, dependent, and passive personalities. Media presence often perpetuates that men are not allowed to be caring and that women are not allowed to be strong and demanding. These gender influences from the media can mislead a growing child or teenager because while they are still trying to construct their identities and genders in a social environment, they are surrounded by biased influences.\n\nAnatomical studies have shown that the larynx of a child, and by extension the fundamental frequency, is likely to vary directly as a result of size and height, rather than sex. Sachs et al. suggest that if there is no difference between the size of the articulatory mechanism in children, differences in formant production between boys and girls may be a result of \"culturally determined patterns that are viewed as appropriate for each sex\" and a result of the speaker's deliberate phonetic variation in vowel production or changing the configuration of the lips.\n\nInclusiveness and acceptance play significant roles in social constructionist practice – examples include sharing work with others in a cooperative manner, including a diverse sample, being open to other interpretations of data, and blurring the lines between scientific research, participatory research and social activism. The blurring of scientific research also means incorporating other disciplines into psychological work (e.g. performative psychology includes artistic expression or humor) and thinking in terms that go beyond traditional scientific language. These methods are not currently valued in psychology because they are not seen as \"scientific.\"\n\nA social constructionist psychologist can make it explicit that his or her perspective is not universally true in all contexts across historical periods. Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique – no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations. Related to this is the idea that social constructionists must constantly question their own work because their work can be constantly reinterpreted and have different meanings at different times.\n\nThe gender dichotomy is so ingrained that it is impossible for research findings to remain unaffected by it. People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings. That is, research questions are framed in ways that look for a difference between genders, and thus their methods will be constrained by this framework as well. Moreover, the actual outcome of the study, even if the claims are dubious or modest at best, often come to be accepted as facts if they support the gender discourse narrative and are often cited and discussed. This phenomenon is labeled the \"hall of mirrors\" effect.\n\nIn order to fully and accurately record the socialization processes at play regarding gender construction, ethnographic and longitudinal studies are ideal. However, these methods have their constraints. It is costly and time consuming to carry out such studies that would yield significant results, and there is an abundance of factors that influence an individual's gender construction. Thus, more research is needed regarding the social construction of gender.\n\nResearch can either be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative data is beneficial because it can give a voice to the subjects of the study. However, poorly-constructed qualitative research can lead to reproduction of race and class biases if findings are inappropriately generalized. For example, qualitative research methods often involve small, homogeneous samples. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to generalize the findings of a study conducted on a specific group of people and then apply them to all people of that gender.\n\nQuantitative data is useful when hard data is needed, such as addressing policy issues, when hard data is needed to convince people unfamiliar with the topics. However, quantitative research can reinforce gender and cultural assumptions as well through item construction. That is, for data to be quantitatively analysed, they must fit into specific categories. However, such categories can be based on or at least influenced by gender stereotypes.\n\nGender often means adhering to gender normative behavior and roles. The performance of gender reinforces the essentialism of gender categories. Essentialism argues that there are essential differences between genders which manifest themselves in differences in gender performance. Gender performance consists of a stylized practice involving gestures, language, and speech and serves to form and build an identity. When an individual performs their gender to the standards set by societal norms, this bolsters the argument of gender essentialism. Historically, men have assumed a dominant gender role, and women have been prescribed a role submissive to men. In order for subordination to go unquestioned, the structure must not appear as a cultural product – it must seem natural. Social movements can challenge the categories that appear \"natural.\" Certain legislation can promote equality for men and women, which could call into question whether there needs to be two categories of gender at all (if both are treated equally). Social change relies on an understanding of how inequality is rooted in gender accomplishment.\n\nThroughout history, women have fought for their rights regarding various issues. One of the most significant revolutions of this century is the feminist movement. The first wave, which began in 1854, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the suffragettes. This movement was then followed by Second-wave feminism and Third-wave feminism which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities. Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles. Men and women are agreeing on a more egalitarian responsibility distribution within the family sphere. They are also in agreement that women should and can have roles in the public sphere, especially in leadership positions and that men can have and involved role in the private and domestic sphere. These markers of increasingly liberalized attitudes toward gender roles indicate the trajectory of social change in terms of what is deemed normative.\n\nBecause the theory says that one can \"do\" gender whether they conform to gender norms or not (and is always held accountable for behaving in accordance with gender norms), change seems impossible. If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of \"doing\" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality.\n\nHowever, because gender is \"done\" or constructed, it can also be \"undone\" or deconstructed. The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change.\n\nTheories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the nature versus nurture debate. Much empirical research has been done on to what extent gendered behavior stems from biological factors.\n"}
{"id": "2120066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2120066", "title": "Southern hospitality", "text": "Southern hospitality\n\nSouthern hospitality is a phrase used in American English to describe the stereotype of residents of the Southern United States as particularly warm, sweet, and welcoming to visitors to their homes, or to the South in general. The term has engendered some controversy due to the connection of related practices to the culture of slavery, and its continued use during periods of both overt and covert racism, and other forms of prejudice.\n\nSouthern hospitality \"first existed as a narrowly defined body of social practices among the antebellum planters classes\". As such, the origin of the practice was intimately tied to slavery. One analysis notes:\n\nOver time, however, the concept \"developed into a discourse that stretches far beyond the image of the planter class\", and the principles of Southern hospitality were eventually adopted by African Americans in the South, and incorporated into materials used to advertise destinations in the South to African American tourists. The concept of Southern hospitality has also been examined as a reflection of the deeply held religious beliefs of the region; the idea that one should be good to strangers is an outgrowth of such Biblical parables as the Good Samaritan. Early travel writer Ernest Hamlin Abbott wrote in 1902, \"as religious observances are in the South as naturally included in the hospitality of the home as anything else, so, conversely, hospitality in the South is an integral part of the church services\".\n\nSome characteristics of Southern hospitality were described as early as 1835, when Jacob Abbott attributed the poor quality of taverns in the South to the lack of need for them, given the willingness of Southerners to provide for strangers. Abbott writes:\n\nAbbott further describes how the best stores of the house are at the disposal of visitors. Furthermore, says Abbott:\n\nFood figures highly in Southern hospitality, a large component of the idea being the provision of Southern cuisine to visitors. A cake or other delicacy is often brought to the door of a new neighbor as a mechanism of introduction. Many club and church functions include a meal or at least a dessert and beverage. Churches in the South frequently have large commercial style kitchens to accommodate this tradition, but many \"fellowship suppers\" are \"covered dish\": everyone attending brings a dish. However, if a newcomer arrives without a dish, he or she will be made to feel welcome and served generously. When a death or serious illness occurs, neighbors, friends, and church members generally bring food to the bereaved family for a period of time. A number of cookbooks promise recipes advancing this concept.\n\n"}

{"id": "1031430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1031430", "title": "Tachypsychia", "text": "Tachypsychia\n\nTachypsychia is a neurological condition that alters the perception of time, usually induced by physical exertion, drug use, or a traumatic event. For someone affected by tachypsychia, time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts, objects appearing as moving in a speeding blur. It is believed that tachypsychia is induced by a combination of high levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, usually during periods of great physical stress or in violent confrontation. Interestingly, a controlled experiment from 2007 suggests the subjective experience of time slowing down is actually an artifact of memory, not an actual trait of real-time perception. However, newer research seems to contradict this, with results showing that during high stress events a focus on action preparation actually does increase information processing, slowing down time perception. A 2012 review of most current research (including the 2007 study) seems to support this as well. Due to the contradictory research results and difficulty of accurately replicating the natural conditions in which the phenomenon occurs, there is still no set consensus on how tachypsychia functions.\n\nAlso called the \"fight or flight\" response of the body to an event our mind considers life-threatening, tachypsychia is believed to include numerous physical changes.\n\nUpon being stimulated by fear or anger, the adrenal medulla may automatically produce the hormone adrenaline directly into the blood stream. This can have various effects on various bodily systems, including:\n\nIt is common for an individual to experience auditory exclusion or sensitivity. It is also common for individuals to experience an increased pain tolerance, loss of color vision, short term memory loss, decreased fine motor skills, decreased communication skills, or decreased coordination.\n\nThe most common experience during tachypsychia is the feeling that time has either increased or slowed down, brought on by the increased brain activity caused by epinephrine, or the severe decrease in brain activity caused by the \"catecholamine washout\" occurring after the event. The perception of the duration of an event seems to be modulated by our recent experiences. Humans typically overestimate the perceived duration of the initial event in a stream of identical events and unexpected \"oddball\" stimuli seem to be perceived as longer in duration, relative to expected or frequently presented \"standard\" stimuli.\n\nThe oddball effect may serve an evolutionarily adapted \"alerting\" function and is consistent with reports of time slowing down in threatening situations. The effect seems to be strongest for images that are expanding in size on the retina, in other words, that are \"looming\" or approaching the viewer, and the effect can be eradicated for oddballs that are contracting or perceived to be receding from the viewer. The effect is also reduced or reversed with a static oddball presented amongst a stream of expanding stimuli.\n\nInitial studies suggested that this oddball-induced “subjective time dilation” expanded the perceived duration of oddball stimuli by 30–50% but subsequent research has reported more modest expansion of around 10% or less. The direction of the effect, whether the viewer perceives an increase or a decrease in duration, also seems to be dependent upon the stimulus used.\n\nIt is common for an individual experiencing tachypsychia to have serious misinterpretations of their surroundings during the events, through a combination of their altered perception of time, as well as transient partial color blindness and tunnel vision. After the irregularly high levels of adrenaline consumed during sympathetic nervous system activation, an individual may display signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is common for the person to display extreme emotional liability and fatigue, regardless of their actual physical exertion.\n\nPossibly related to the oddball effect, research suggests that time seems to slow down for a person during intense events—such as a car accident, a robbery, a chase, skydiving or bungee jumping, a potential predator threat or an intimacy with sexual partner (which would elicit sexual excitement, which in turn release adrenaline), where they're capable of complex thoughts in what would normally be the blink of an eye caused by Fight-or-flight response. This reported slowing in temporal perception may have been evolutionary advantageous because it may have enhanced one's ability to intelligibly make quick decisions in moments that were of critical importance to our survival. However, even though observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unclear whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion created by the remembering of an emotionally salient event.\n\nAn Israeli research team have observed a strong time dilation effect in objects that were looming, but not the retreating, from the subjects. They theorize that the expanding discs—which mimic an approaching object—elicit self-referential processes which act to signal the presence of a possible danger. Anxious people, or those in great fear, experience greater \"time dilation\" in response to the same threat stimuli brought on by the increased brain activity caused by epinephrine, or an adrenaline rush. In such circumstances, an illusion of time dilation could assist an efficacious escape. When exposed to a threat, three-year-old children were observed to exhibit a similar tendency to overestimate elapsed time.\n\nSome research suggests that the effect appears only at the point of retrospective assessment, rather than occurring simultaneously with events as they happened. Perceptual abilities were tested during a frightening experience - a free fall - by measuring people's sensitivity to flickering stimuli. The results showed that the subjects' temporal resolution was not improved as the frightening event was occurring. Events appear to have taken longer only in retrospect, possibly because memories were being more densely packed during the frightening situation.\n\nHowever, newer research from 2012 suggests that effective motor preparation (the paper giving the example of professional athletes) can indeed lead to slowed time perception, involving not memory but enhanced sensory processing. In addition, a review of most current research on the topic by the University of Turku also supports the above results.\n\nPeople shown extracts from films known to induce fear often overestimated the elapsed time of a subsequently presented visual stimulus, whereas people shown clips known to evoke feelings of sadness or emotionally-neutral clips from weather forecasts and stock market updates showed no difference. It is argued that fear prompts a state of arousal in the amygdala, which increases the rate of a hypothesised \"internal clock.\" This could be the result of an evolved defensive mechanism triggered by a threatening situation.\n\nResearch has suggested the feeling of awe has the ability to expand one's perceptions of time availability. Awe can be characterized as an experience of immense perceptual vastness that coincides with an increase in focus. Consequently, it is conceivable that one's temporal perception would slow down when experiencing awe. The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time. The theory of embodied mind (or cognition), as caused by mirror neurons, helps explain how the perception of other people's emotions has the ability to change one's own sense of time. Embodied cognition hinges on an internal process that mimics or simulates another's emotional state. For example, if person #1 spends time with person #2 who speaks and walks incredibly slowly, person #1's internal clock may slow down.\n\nDepression may increase one's ability to perceive time accurately. One study assessed this concept by asking subjects to estimate the amount of time that passed during intervals ranging from 3 seconds to 65 seconds. Results indicated that depressed subjects more accurately estimated the amount of time that had passed than non-depressed patients; non-depressed subjects overestimated the passing of time. This difference was hypothesized to be because depressed subjects focused less on external factors that may skew their judgement of time. The authors termed this hypothesized phenomenon \"depressive realism.\"\n\nThe perception of time is temporarily suspended during sleep, or more often during REM sleep. This can be attributed to the altered state of consciousness associated with sleep where the person is kept unaware of their surroundings, which would make it difficult to remain informed of the passing of time. When the person awakes in the morning, they have the memory of going to bed the night before, but new memories are rarely made during sleep.\n\nTherefore, upon waking up the following morning it feels as if no time has passed, but the human mind reasons that many hours have elapsed simply because it is now light outside. The passing of time is a relative event brought about by observation of objects (the sun’s location, the moon, a clock's time). Without a reference point there would be no context other than day or night. So, as far as time passing faster when during sleep may be due to the lack of reference points that convince the sleeper the time has passed quickly.\n\nStimulants produce overestimates of time duration, whereas depressants and anesthetics produce underestimates of time duration.\n\nPsychoactive drugs can alter the judgement of time. These include traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline as well as the dissociative class of psychedelics such as PCP, ketamine and dextromethorphan. At higher doses time may appear to slow down, speed up or seem out of sequence. In 1955, British MP Christopher Mayhew took mescaline hydrochloride in an experiment under the guidance of his friend, Dr Humphry Osmond. On the BBC documentary \"The Beyond Within\", he described that half a dozen times during the experiment, he had \"a period of time that didn't end for [him]\".\n\nDopamine has a particularly strong connection with one's perception of time. Drugs that activate dopamine receptors speed up one's perception of time, while dopamine antagonists cause one to feel that time is passing slowly.\n\nThe effect of cannabis on time perception has been studied with inconclusive results.\n\n\n"}

The phrase has received criticism for its repeated usage in the context of gun violence or terrorism, with critics claiming \"thoughts and prayers\" are offered as substitutes for actions they believe would be corrective, like gun control or counterterrorism.\n\nThe phrase \"thoughts and prayers\" is frequently used as an expression of condolences for victims of natural disasters (eg. the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and 2011 Christchurch earthquake).\n\nThe phrase has been deployed in the wake of numerous mass shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre (1999), the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Orlando nightclub shooting, and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. In addition, \"thoughts and prayers\" are also offered to victims of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina (2005), the 2017 Central Mexico earthquake, and Hurricane Maria (2017).\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been known to use the phrase. In 2016, he used it following the St. Joseph courthouse shooting, the Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and the shooting of Nykea Aldridge. In 2017 he used it following the Congressional baseball shooting in June and the Southern California wildfires in December. In 2018, Trump used the phrase following the Marshall County High School shooting in January, the Carcassonne and Trèbes attack in March, the YouTube headquarters shooting in April, and the \"Capital Gazette\" shooting in June. Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February, \"Slate\" noted that several Republican politicians who had previously used the idiom (including Trump and senators Marco Rubio and Pat Toomey) avoided using the specific phrase \"thoughts and prayers\" in response to the shooting. Trump, for example, instead offered \"prayers and condolences\" via Twitter.\n\nAfter a natural or human-caused disaster, people may be urged to \"go beyond thoughts and prayers,\" by donating blood or sending aid or money to help the victims. After the Las Vegas shooting, authorities said that although thoughts and prayers are appreciated, the most effective way to help was to give blood.\n\nAs \"thoughts and prayers\" became associated with post-tragedy condolences, commentators have criticized the phrase as a form of civilian or political slacktivism.\n\nAfter the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of \"The Nation\", called on politicians to \"move beyond thoughts and prayers\". In her post, vanden Heuvel referred to a press release by Paul Helmke, then-president of the Brady Campaign, who offered his thoughts and prayers but also stated \"it is long overdue for us to take some common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur.\"\n\nIn October 2015, following the Umpqua Community College shooting, President Barack Obama said that \"thoughts and prayers [do] not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted some place else in America next week or a couple months from now.\" The White House subsequently announced that Obama would continue to take more executive action on the subject of gun control.\n\nOn December 2, 2015, in the wake of the San Bernardino mass shooting, Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) tweeted his frustration with the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\", a sentiment echoed by the cover of the \"New York Daily News\", which included tweets from senators and representatives the newspaper characterized as \"meaningless platitudes\".\n\nFollowing the Orlando nightclub shooting, Phil Plait wrote that while it was \"natural and very human\" to \"send their thoughts and express their grief ... it's cynically hypocritical when politicians do it \"and nothing else\"\", later noting it was \"particularly galling\" to see \"all the NRA-funded lawmakers tweeting their 'thoughts and prayers'\". An accompanying \"Slate\" post provided a selected list of members of Congress who had tweeted \"thoughts and prayers\" along with the amount of campaign contributions they had received from gun rights groups, based on research provided by Igor Volsky of the Center for American Progress.\n\nSome critics of the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\" point to the Epistle of James in the Christian New Testament to argue that action is needed in addition to expressions of faith. Verses commonly cited to back up this argument include:\n\nLaura Coward, a writer for \"The Huffington Post\", defended the use of the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\", acknowledging the inadequacy of not taking actions, but arguing that prayer \"jolts us and disrupts us, removing us from our comfort zones [... it] takes us to uncomfortable places – spiritually, physically and emotionally – and asks us to do the hard work of accepting more than one perspective.\" Kimberly Ross, a writer for \"RedState\", asks that victims should \"not [be] used as pawns in another political debate about guns\" since \"[w]e shouldn't blame anyone but the perpetrator for crimes committed, [...] that means we can do nothing on our own – in that moment – apart from submitting thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nIn his third stand up special \"Thoughts and Prayers\", comedian Anthony Jeselnik skewers people who tweet out \"thoughts and prayers\" on the day of a tragedy, calling it a way for those people to garner attention in the face of a tragedy and saying that tweeting thoughts and prayers is so useless that it achieves \"less than nothing\".\n\nIn 2016, a web-based video game, \"Thoughts and Prayers: The Game\", was published to argue that thoughts and prayers have had no effect on saving lives in the context of mass shootings.\n\nThe fifth episode of the fourth season of animated series \"BoJack Horseman\", titled \"Thoughts and Prayers\", presents a real-life shooting that delays the opening of a new movie featuring gun violence.\n\nIn June 2017, the air date for an episode of \"The Carmichael Show\" entitled \"Shoot-up-able\", which showed the main character surviving a mass shooting, was postponed by two weeks so that it did not air 14 June, the same night as the shooting at which Representative Scalise and three others were shot, or the UPS shooting in San Francisco, where three were killed by a shooter who later committed suicide.\n\nIn early August 2018, after court documents were made public showing the NRA was having financial issues, mocking tweets were made offering thoughts and prayers for the NRA's troubles.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30008114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30008114", "title": "True self and false self", "text": "True self and false self\n\nTrue self (also known as real self, authentic self, original self and vulnerable self) and false self (also known as fake self, idealized self, superficial self and pseudo self) are psychological concepts often used in connection with narcissism. \n\nThe concepts were introduced into psychoanalysis in 1960 by Donald Winnicott. Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience, and a feeling of being alive, having a real self. The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade – one which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real.\n\nTo maintain their self-esteem, and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists need to control others' behavior – particularly that of their children, seen as extensions of themselves.\n\nWinnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being. Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of reality, a sense that life is worth living. The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that instinctual sense, and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self.\n\nHowever, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect! – was \"not\" in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations. The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where \"Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being\". The danger he saw was that \"through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real\", while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.\n\nThe danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis. But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself.\n\nThere was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. Helene Deutsch had described the \"as if\" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones. Winnicott's analyst, Joan Riviere, had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control. Freud's own late theory of the ego as the product of identifications came close to viewing it only as a false self; while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to Michael Balint's \"basic fault\" and to Ronald Fairbairn's notion of the \"compromised ego\".\n\nErich Fromm, in his book \"The Fear of Freedom\" distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom; while much earlier the existentialist like Kierkegaard had claimed that \"to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair\" – the despair of choosing \"to be another than himself\".\n\nKaren Horney, in her 1950 book, \"Neurosis and Human Growth\", based her idea of \"true self\" and \"false self\" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become. (See also Karen Horney § Theory of the self).\n\nThe last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond.\n\nKohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism, seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves. He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.\n\nAlexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but it is a self that must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the denial, it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's acting out. And it can become a perverse force.\n\nJames F. Masterson argued that all the personality disorders crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.\n\nSymington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the \"sources\" of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures. Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action. Symington stressed however the \"intentional\" element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.\n\nAs part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author Sam Vaknin to raise the profile of the condition. Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and narcissistic injury by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.\n\nFor Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.\n\nAlice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have \"any\" formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade; and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon. If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty grandiosity of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.\n\nSusie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself. Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body, so as to cover the idea of the false body – falsified sense of one's own body. Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability. Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.\n\nJungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the persona and Winnicott's false self; but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.\n\nDaniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of \"going on being\" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self. He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed. He ended however by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.\n\nNeville Symington criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of ego and id. Similarly, continental analysts like Jean-Bertrand Pontalis have made use of true/false self as a \"clinical\" distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.\n\nThe philosopher Michel Foucault took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the anti-essentialist grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an \"aesthetics\" of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered: \"we have to create ourselves as a work of art\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2278914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278914", "title": "Uniform access principle", "text": "Uniform access principle\n\nThe uniform access principle of computer programming was put forth by Bertrand Meyer (originally in \"Object-Oriented Software Construction\"). It states \"All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation\". This principle applies generally to the syntax of object-oriented programming languages. In simpler form, it states that there should be no syntactical difference between working with an attribute, pre-computed property, or method/query of an object.\n\nWhile most examples focus on the \"read\" aspect of the principle (i.e., retrieving a value), Meyer shows that the \"write\" implications (i.e., modifying a value) of the principle are harder to deal with in his monthly column on the Eiffel programming language official website.\n\nThe problem being addressed by Meyer involves the maintenance of large software projects or software libraries. Sometimes when developing or maintaining software it is necessary, after much code is in place, to change a class or object in a way that transforms what was simply an attribute access into a method call. Programming languages often use different syntax for attribute access and invoking a method, (e.g., versus ). The syntax change would require, in popular programming languages of the day, changing the source code in all the places where the attribute was used. This might require changing source code in many different locations throughout a very large volume of source code. Or worse, if the change is in an object library used by hundreds of customers, each of those customers would have to find and change all the places the attribute was used in their own code and recompile their programs.\n\nGoing the reverse way (from method to simple attribute) really was not a problem, as one can always just keep the function and have it simply return the attribute value.\n\nMeyer recognized the need for software developers to write code in such a way as to minimize or eliminate cascading changes in code that result from changes which convert an object attribute to a method call or vice versa. For this he developed the Uniform Access Principle.\n\nMany programming languages do not strictly support the UAP but do support forms of it. Properties, which are provided in a number of programming languages, address the problem Meyer was addressing with his UAP in a different way. Instead of providing a single uniform notation, properties provide a way to invoke a method of an object while using the same notation as is used for attribute access. The separate method invocation syntax is still available.\n\nIf the language uses the method invocation syntax it may look something like this.\n\nWhen executed, should display :\n\nWhether or not Foo.bar(5) invokes a function or simply sets an attribute is hidden from the caller.\nLikewise whether Foo.bar() simply retrieves the value of the attribute, or invokes a function\nto compute the value returned, is an implementation detail hidden from the caller.\n\nIf the language uses the attribute syntax the syntax may look like this.\n\nAgain, whether or not a method is invoked, or the value is simply assigned to an attribute is hidden\nfrom the calling method.\n\nHowever, UAP itself can lead to problems, if used in places where the differences between access methods are \"not\" negligible, such as when the returned value is expensive to compute or will trigger cache operations. It might not matter in principle to the client how the value of 42 was obtained, but if computing it requires running a planet-sized computer for 7.5 million years, the client ought to know what to expect.\n\nConsider the following\n\nNow the Egg class could be defined as follows\n\nThe above initial code segment would work fine with the Egg being defined as such. The Egg\nclass could also be defined as below, where color is instead a method. The calling code would\nstill work, unchanged if Egg were to be defined as follows.\nNote how even though codice_1 looks like an attribute in one case and a pair of methods\nin the next, the interface to the class remains the same. The person maintaining the Egg class can switch from one form to the other without fear of breaking any caller's code.\nRuby follows the revised UAP, the codice_2 only acts as syntactic sugar for generating accessor/setter methods for codice_1. There is no way in Ruby to retrieve an instance variable from an object without calling a method on it.\n\nStrictly speaking, Ruby does not follow Meyer's original UAP in that the syntax for accessing an attribute is different from the syntax for invoking a method. But here, the access for an attribute will always actually be through a function which is often automatically generated. So in essence, either type of access invokes a function and the language does follow Meyer's revised Uniform Access Principle.\n\nPython properties may be used to allow a method\nto be invoked with the same syntax as accessing an attribute. Whereas Meyer's UAP would have\na single notation for both attribute access and method invocation (method invocation syntax), \na language with support for properties still supports separate notations for attribute\nand method access. Properties allow the attribute notation to be used, but to hide the\nfact that a method is being invoked instead of simply retrieving or setting a value. \n\nIn the strict sense, Python does NOT follow the UAP because there is a syntax difference\nbetween normal method invocations and attribute access.\n\nIn Python, we may have code that access an object as follows \n\nA Egg object could be defined such that weight and color are simple attributes as in the following\n\nOr the Egg object could use properties, and invoke methods instead\n\nRegardless of which way Egg is defined, the calling code can remain the same. The implementation of Egg can switch from one form to the other without affecting code that uses the Egg class. Languages which implement the UAP have this property as well.\n\nThe C# language supports class \"properties\", which provide a means to define and operations (\"getters\" and \"setters\") for a member variable. The syntax to access or modify the property is the same as accessing any other class member variable, but the actual implementation for doing so can be defined as either a simple read/write access or as functional code.\nIn the example above, class contains two properties, and . The property is an integer that can be read (get) and written (set). Similarly, the property is a string that can also be read and modified, but its value is stored in a separate (private) class variable .\n\nOmitting the operation in a property definition makes the property read-only, while omitting the operation makes it write-only.\n\nUse of the properties employs the UAP, as shown in the code below.\nC++ has neither the UAP nor properties, when an object is changed such that an attribute (color) becomes a pair of functions (getA, setA). Any place in that uses an instance of the object and either sets or gets the attribute value ( x = obj.color or obj.color= x) must be changed to invoke one of the functions. ( x = obj.getColor() or obj.setColor(x)). Using templates and operator overloading, it is possible to fake properties, but this is more complex than in languages which directly support properties. This complicates maintenance of C++ programs. Distributed libraries of C++ objects must be careful about how they provide access to member data.\n"}

It gains its name from the white markings on its flippers, unique to the subspecies. It nests only on Banks Peninsula and Motunau Island, near Christchurch, New Zealand, with only around 3,750 breeding pairs.\n\nThe white-flippered penguin is currently considered by most taxonomists to be a colour morph or subspecies of the little penguin (\"E. minor\"). Analysis of mtDNA in 2002 revealed two clades in \"Eudyptula\": one containing little penguins of New Zealand's North Island, Cook Strait and Chatham Island, as well as the white-flippered penguin, and a second containing little penguins of Australia and the southeastern coast of New Zealand's South Island. Preliminary analysis of braying calls and cluster analysis of morphometrics partially supported these results. In 2008, Shirihai treated the little penguin and white-flippered penguin as allospecies. However, as of 2012, the IUCN and BirdLife International consider the white-flippered penguin to be a subspecies or morph of the little penguin.\n\nWhite-flippered penguins live in headlands, caves, rock jumbles, and in the sheltered areas at the bases of bays. They are found mostly in Canterbury, New Zealand.\n\nWhite-flippered penguins are primarily nocturnal animals on land and are unique among penguins in this respect. They differ from other penguins in that they stay with the colony during the day, and then leave under the cover of darkness and return before dawn. However, on Banks Peninsula, some birds can be observed on land outside their burrows during daylight.\n\nIn the evening, these penguins tend to assemble offshore in groups until light levels are low enough for them to feel sufficiently safe to head inland. This results in large batches of birds arriving at one time.\n\nThe white-flippered penguin lays its eggs from July to December, with most egg-laying occurring August through November. The eggs are always laid in burrows under tree brush almost like nests; they are also laid in dunes, or on vegetated slopes, and are incubated for 33 to 39 days. Chicks fledge after 50 to 65 days.\n\nThe white-flippered penguin feeds on small shoaling fish, such as pilchards and anchovies, or cephalopods, and less often on crustaceans. It catches its food by pursuit diving. Most feeding takes place within of the coast with daily round trips. The farthest trip out to sea for food was offshore.\n\nIn August 2010 the white-flippered penguin was listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe Motunau Beach Biodiversity Development Team are working on a conservation project for white-flippered penguins.\n"}
{"id": "14554044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14554044", "title": "Wisconsin model", "text": "Wisconsin model\n\nThe Wisconsin model of socio-economic attainment is a model that describes and explains an individual's social mobility and its economic, social, and psychological determinants. The logistics of this model are primarily attributed to William H. Sewell, as well as his colleagues Archibald Haller and Alejandro Portes. The model receives its name from the state in which a significant amount of the research and analysis was completed. Unlike the previous research on this topic by Peter Blau and Otis Dudley Duncan, this model encompasses more than just educational and occupational factors and their effect on social mobility for American males.\n\nBefore the framework for the Wisconsin model was constructed, Peter Blau and Otis Duncan established the first model of social mobility of its kind. However, the Blau-Duncan model was made up of only five predictors. These included father's education and occupation, the individual's education and first job, and the individual's job several years later.\n\nSewell and his counterparts aimed to contribute to the Blau-Duncan model of status attainment by adding predictor variables. Because the results given by the Blau-Duncan model were based heavily on \"structural factors as explanatory variables\", the Wisconsin model was created to account for \"social-psychological factors on educational and occupational attainment\", which in turn, provided more accurate prediction. These variables, in turn, came from analyses done by Sewell and Haller in the 1950s and published (with Sewell's agreement) by Haller and Miller (1963, 1971). The latter work includes the theory on which the psychosociological variables of the WM are based.\n\nThe model consisted of eight characteristics that most effectively linked socio-economic background and status attainment. These included occupational attainment, educational attainment, level of occupational aspiration, level of educational aspiration, the influence of significant others, academic performance, socioeconomic status, and mental ability.\n\nMeasured by Otis Dudley Duncan's socio-economic index of occupational status.\n\nAchieved by assigning a point value to certain levels of education that a subject has reached. In more recent studies using this model, educational attainment was classified into four levels: no post high school education, vocational school, college attendance, and a college degree. Earlier studies only classified subjects into those who went to college and those who did not.\n\nThe subject's level is calculated by again categorizing Duncan's socioeconomic index scores in association with the occupation that the subject hope to hold in the future.\n\nThis is classified by the education level that each subject originally indicates that they hope to secure. Once again, some recent studies have assigned point values for three levels of desired education level: not continuing education after high school, vocational school, or college. Previous studies only categorized students based on which type institution they planned on attending prior to high school graduation.\n\nThis variable can be determined by evaluating three perceptions of the subject including: parental and teacher encouragement to attend college, as well as friends' college plans. Additional work regarding the influence of significant others on occupational aspirations was subsequently done by Haller and is students Joseph Woelfel and Ed L. Fink.\n\nThe original Sewell, Haller and Portes article Sewell which first reported the broad outlines of the Wisconsin model relied on data from a statewide survey of all Wisconsin high school seniors that included information about whether students perceived their parents, teachers and friends as expecting them to go to college. Later work initiated by Archie O. Haller and implemented by Joseph Woelfel and Edward L. Fink was able to survey adolescent students and identify the specific persons who communicated most with them about education and occupation, and who served as examples for their own educational and occupational futures. The \"Significant Other Project\" also produced survey instruments which identified the specific significant others for educational and occupational aspirations and measured their educational and occupational aspirations for the students\n\nThis value is calculated by the subject's high school class rank.\n\nIn the original study, socio-economic status was determined by a weighted combination of mother's and father's education, father's occupation, and average annual income from 1957-1960.\n\nThis variable is determined by the analysis of standardized testing. In previous studies, statewide test results for high school juniors and seniors are compared with state intelligence norms.\n\nPrimarily, the significant others' direct influence on the subject specifically relates to one's educational and occupational aspirations and also educational attainment. Basically, this implies that those who are constantly involved with a subject (mother, father, friend) will have a direct outcome on what type of education the subject receives.\n\nEssentially, this implies that a person's status attainment can only be limited by one's own \"perceived ability\". Social structural factors, however, determine the expectations of an individual's significant others—which then influence the person's attitudes. These attitudes themselves then exert directive forces over both academic performance and later educational and occupational attainments.\n\nOne's desire to attain status is an obligation for educational and occupational attainment.\n\nBecause this model organizes how status aspirations are formed and the way in which they influence \"attainment-oriented behavior\" the following conclusions can be drawn from the model:\n\n\"Status aspirations are complex forms of attitudes whose translation into attainment levels is affected by the context in which individuals attempt to enact them.\"\n\n\"Attitudes - including levels of aspiration - are formed and altered through two basic mechanisms; interpersonal influence, including reflexive adjustment of others' expectations, and including self-reflexion.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "379472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379472", "title": "Youth", "text": "Youth\n\nYouth is the time of life when one is young, and often means the time between childhood and adulthood (maturity). It is also defined as \"the appearance, freshness, vigor, spirit, etc., characteristic of one who is young\". Its definitions of a specific age range varies, as youth is not defined chronologically as a stage that can be tied to specific age ranges; nor can its end point be linked to specific activities, such as taking unpaid work or having sexual relations without consent.\n\nYouth is an experience that may shape an individual's level of dependency, which can be marked in various ways according to different cultural perspectives. Personal experience is marked by an individual's cultural norms or traditions, while a youth's level of dependency means the extent to which he still relies on his family emotionally and economically.\n\nAround the world, the English terms \"youth\", \"adolescent\", \"teenager\", \"kid\", and \"young person\" are interchanged, often meaning the same thing, but they are occasionally differentiated. \"Youth\" can be referred to as the time of life when one is young. This involves childhood, and the time of life which is neither childhood nor adulthood, but rather somewhere in between. \"Youth\" also identifies a particular mindset of attitude, as in \"He is very \"youth\"ful\". For certain uses, such as employment statistics, the term also sometimes refers to individuals from the ages of 14 to 21. However, the term \"adolescence\" refers to a specific age range during a specific developmental period in a person's life, unlike youth which is a socially constructed category.\n\nThe United Nations defines \"youth\" as persons between the ages of 15 and 24 with all UN statistics based on this range, the UN states education as a source for these statistics. The UN also recognizes that this varies without prejudice to other age groups listed by member states such as 18–30. A useful distinction within the UN itself can be made between teenagers (i.e. those between the ages of 13 and 19) and young adults (those between the ages of 18 and 32). While seeking to impose some uniformity on statistical approaches, the UN itself is aware of contradictions between approaches in its own statutes. Hence under the 15–24 definition (introduced in 1981) children are defined as those under the age of 14 while under the 1979 Convention on the Rights of the Child, those under the age of 18 are regarded as children. The UN also states they are aware that several definitions exist for youth within UN entities such as Youth Habitat 15–32 and African Youth Charter 15–35.\n\nAlthough linked to biological processes of development and aging, \"youth\" is also defined as a social position that reflects the meanings different cultures and societies give to individuals between childhood and adulthood. The term in itself when referred to in a manner of social position, can be ambiguous when applied to someone of an older age with very low social position; potentially when still dependent on their guardians. Scholars argue that age-based definitions have not been consistent across cultures or times and that thus it is more accurate to focus on social processes in the transition to adult independence for defining youth.\n\nYouth is the stage of constructing the self-concept. The self-concept of youth is influenced by variables such as peers, lifestyle, gender, and culture. It is a time of a person's life when their choices are most likely to affect their future.\n\nIn much of sub-Saharan Africa, the term \"youth\" is associated with young men from 15 to 30 or 35 years of age. Youth in Nigeria includes all members of the Federal Republic of Nigeria aged 18–35. Many African girls experience youth as a brief interlude between the onset of puberty and marriage and motherhood. But in urban settings, poor women are often considered youth much longer, even if they bear children outside of marriage. Varying culturally, the gender constructions of youth in Latin America and Southeast Asia differ from those of sub-Saharan Africa. In Vietnam, widespread notions of youth are sociopolitical constructions for both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35.\n\nIn Brazil, the term \"youth\" refers to people of both sexes from 15 to 29 years old. This age bracket reflects the influence on Brazilian law of international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also shaped by the notion of adolescence that has entered everyday life in Brazil through a discourse on children's rights.\n\nThe intergovernmental organization Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines \"youth\" as \"those between 15 and 29 years of age\".\n\nAugust 12 was declared International Youth Day by the United Nations.\n\nChildren's rights cover all the rights that belong to children. When they grow up they are granted with new rights (like voting, consent, driving, etc.) and duties (criminal response, etc.). There are different minimum limits of age at which youth are not free, independent or legally competent to take some decisions or actions. Some of these limits are voting age, age of candidacy, age of consent, age of majority, age of criminal responsibility, drinking age, driving age, etc. After youth reach these limits they are free to vote, have sexual intercourse, buy or consume alcohol beverages or drive cars, etc.\n\nVoting age is the minimum age established by law that a person must attain to be eligible to vote in a public election. Typically, the age is set at 18 years; however, ages as low as 16 and as high as 21 exist (see list below). Studies show that 21% of all 18 year olds have experience with voting. This is an important right since, by voting they can support politics selected by themselves and not only by people of older generations.\n\nAge of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access.\n\nThe age of consent is the age at which a person is considered legally competent to consent to sexual acts, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.\n\nThe defense of infancy is a form of defense known as an excuse so that defendants falling within the definition of an \"infant\" are excluded from criminal liability for their actions, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. This implies that children lack the judgment that comes with age and experience to be held criminally responsible. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.\n\nThe legal drinking age is the age at which a person can consume or purchase alcoholic beverages. These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed. The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries. These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances. Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places). Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.\n\nDriving age is the age at which a person can apply for a driver's license. Countries with the lowest driving ages (below 17) are Australia, Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Estonia, Macedonia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Sweden, the United Kingdom (Mainland) and United States. The Canadian province of Alberta and several U.S. states permit youth driving as low as 14. Niger has the highest minimum driving age in the world at 23. In India, driving is legal after getting a license at the age of 18.\n\nThe legal working age is the minimum age required by law for a person to work, in each country or jurisdiction. The threshold of adulthood, or \"the age of majority\" as recognized or declared in law in most countries has been set at age 18. Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the age of majority. Activities that are dangerous, harmful to the health or that may affect the morals of minors fall into this category.\n\nStudent rights are those rights, such as civil, constitutional, contractual and consumer rights, which regulate student rights and freedoms and allow students to make use of their educational investment. These include such things as the right to free speech and association, to due process, equality, autonomy, safety and privacy, and accountability in contracts and advertising, which regulate the treatment of students by teachers and administrators.\n\nThe smoking age is the minimum age a person can buy tobacco, and/or smoke in public. Most countries regulate this law at the national level while at some it is done by the state or province.\n\nThe growth of youth unemployment, which reached new heights of 22.5% across the European Union, as well as the precarisation of labor market conditions reveals that the gap between labor market 'outsiders' and 'insiders' is widening. One of the most dramatic possible consequences of this growing divergence could arguably be the disenfranchisement of labour market outsiders, especially young people, from social and political participation (Ferragina et al. 2016). If the objective of policymakers is to revive social and political participation in a period of great disenchantment and declining legitimacy for our democracies, there is definitely scope for further enquiry and action into the effects of youth outsiderness on social and political participation.\n\nYoung people spend much of their lives in educational settings, and their experiences in schools, colleges and universities can shape much of their subsequent lives. Research shows that poverty and income affect the likelihood for the incompletion of high school. These factors also increase the likelihood for the youth to not go to a college or university. In the United States, 12.3 percent of young people ages 16 to 24 are disconnected, meaning they are neither in school nor working. \n\nThe leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults are due to certain health-risk behaviors. These behaviors are often established during youth and extend into adulthood. Since the risk behaviors in adulthood and youth are interrelated, problems in adulthood are preventable by influencing youth behavior.\n\nA 2004 mortality study of youth (defined in this study as ages 10–24) mortality worldwide found that 97% of deaths occurred in low to middle-income countries, with the majority in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal conditions accounted for 15% of female deaths, while HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis were responsible for 11% of deaths; 14% of male and 5% of female deaths were attributed to traffic accidents, the largest cause overall. Violence accounted for 12% of male deaths. Suicide was the cause of 6% of all deaths.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed its Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in 2003 to help assess risk behavior. YRBSS monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults. These are behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence;\n\nYRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC as well as state and local school-based surveys conducted by education and health agencies.\n\nObesity now affects one in five children in the United States, and is the most prevalent nutritional disease of children and adolescents in the United States. Although obesity-associated morbidities occur more frequently in adults, significant consequences of obesity as well as the antecedents of adult disease occur in obese children and adolescents.\n\nDiscrimination against overweight children begins early in childhood and becomes progressively institutionalized. Obese children may be taller than their non-overweight peers, in which case they are apt to be viewed as more mature. The inappropriate expectations that result may have an adverse effect on their socialization.\n\nMany of the cardiovascular consequences that characterize adult-onset obesity are preceded by abnormalities that begin in childhood. Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and abnormal glucose tolerance occur with increased frequency in obese children and adolescents. The relationship of cardiovascular risk factors to visceral fat independent of total body fat remains unclear. Sleep apnea, pseudotumor cerebri, and Blount's disease represent major sources of morbidity for which rapid and sustained weight reduction is essential. Although several periods of increased risk appear in childhood, it is not clear whether obesity with onset early in childhood carries a greater risk of adult morbidity and mortality.\n\nBullying among school-aged youth is increasingly being recognized as an important problem affecting well-being and social functioning. While a certain amount of conflict and harassment is typical of youth peer relations, bullying presents a potentially more serious threat to healthy youth development. The definition of bullying is widely agreed on in literature on bullying.\n\nThe majority of research on bullying has been conducted in Europe and Australia. Considerable variability among countries in the prevalence of bullying has been reported. In an international survey of adolescent health-related behaviors, the percentage of students who reported being bullied at least once during the current term ranged from a low of 15% to 20% in some countries to a high of 70% in others. Of particular concern is frequent bullying, typically defined as bullying that occurs once a week or more. The prevalence of frequent bullying reported internationally ranges from a low of 1.9% among one Irish sample to a high of 19% in a Malta study.\n\nResearch examining characteristics of youth involved in bullying has consistently found that both bullies and those bullied demonstrate poorer psychosocial functioning than their non-involved peers. Youth who bully others tend to demonstrate higher levels of conduct problems and dislike of school, whereas youth who are bullied generally show higher levels of insecurity, anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness, physical and mental symptoms, and low self-esteem. Males who are bullied also tend to be physically weaker than males in general. The few studies that have examined the characteristics of youth who both bully and are bullied found that these individuals exhibit the poorest psychosocial functioning overall.\n\nGlobalization and transnational flows have had tangible effects on sexual relations, identities, and subjectivities. In the wake of an increasingly globalized world order under waning Western dominance, within ideologies of modernity, civilization, and programs for social improvement, discourses on population control, 'safe sex', and 'sexual rights'. Sex education programmes grounded in evidence-based approaches are a cornerstone in reducing adolescent sexual risk behaviours and promoting sexual health. In addition to providing accurate information about consequences of Sexually transmitted disease or STIs and early pregnancy, such programmes build life skills for interpersonal communication and decision making. Such programmes are most commonly implemented in schools, which reach large numbers of teenagers in areas where school enrollment rates are high. However, since not all young people are in school, sex education programmes have also been implemented in clinics, juvenile detention centers and youth-oriented community agencies. Notably, some programmes have been found to reduce risky sexual behaviours when implemented in both school and community settings with only minor modifications to the curricula.\n\nThe Sangguniang Kabataan (\"Youth Council\" in English), commonly known as SK, was a youth council in each barangay (village or district) in the Philippines, before being put \"on hold\", but not quite abolished, prior to the 2013 barangay elections. The council represented teenagers from 15 to 17 years old who have resided in their barangay for at least six months and registered to vote. It was the local youth legislature in the village and therefore led the local youth program and projects of the government. The Sangguniang Kabataan was an offshoot of the KB or the \"Kabataang Barangay\" (Village Youth) which was abolished when the Local Government Code of 1991 was enacted.\n\nThe vast majority of young people live in developing countries: according to the UN, globally around 85 per cent of 15- to 25-year-olds live in developing countries, a figure projected to grow 89.5 per cent by 2025. Moreover, this majority are extremely diverse: some live in rural areas but many inhabit the overcrowded metropolises of India, Mongolia and other parts of Asia and in South America, some live traditional lives in tribal societies, while others participate in global youth culture in ghetto contexts.\n\nMany young lives in developing countries are defined by poverty, some suffer from famine and a lack of clean water, while involvement in armed conflict is all common. Health problems are rife, especially due to the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in certain regions. The United Nations estimates that 200 million young people live in poverty, 130 million are illiterate and 10 million live with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\n"}
