Eighteen months later, his mother committed suicide, whereupon his father gave up medicine and became a clergyman. Lovejoy studied philosophy, first at the University of California at Berkeley, then at Harvard under William James and Josiah Royce. In 1901, he resigned from his first job, at Stanford University, to protest the dismissal of a colleague who had offended a trustee. The President of Harvard then vetoed hiring Lovejoy on the grounds that he was a known troublemaker. Over the subsequent decade, he taught at Washington University, Columbia University, and the University of Missouri. He never married.\n\nAs a professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University from 1910 to 1938, Lovejoy founded and long presided over that university's History of Ideas Club, where many prominent and budding intellectual and social historians, as well as literary critics, gathered. In 1940 he founded the \"Journal of the History of Ideas\". Lovejoy insisted that the history of ideas should focus on \"unit ideas,\" single concepts (namely simple concepts sharing an abstract name with other concepts that were to be conceptually distinguished). Abstract nouns like 'pragmatism' 'idealism', 'rationalism' and the like were, in Lovejoy's view, constituted by distinct, analytically separate ideas, which the historian of the genealogy of ideas had to thresh out, and show how the basic unit ideas combine and recombine with each other over time. The idea has, according to Simo Knuuttila, exercised a greater attraction on literary critics than on philosophers.\n\nLovejoy was active in the public arena. He helped found the American Association of University Professors and the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. However, he qualified his belief in civil liberties to exclude what he considered threats to a free system. Thus, at the height of the McCarthy Era (in the February 14, 1952 edition of the \"Journal of Philosophy\") Lovejoy stated that, since it was a \"matter of empirical fact\" that membership in the Communist Party contributed \"to the triumph of a world-wide organization\" which was opposed to \"freedom of inquiry, of opinion and of teaching,\" membership in the party constituted grounds for dismissal from academic positions. He also published numerous opinion pieces in the Baltimore press. He died in Baltimore on December 30, 1962.\n\nIn the domain of epistemology, Lovejoy is remembered for an influential critique of the pragmatic movement, especially in the essay \"The Thirteen Pragmatisms\", written in 1908.\n\nWilliam F. Bynum, looking back at Lovejoy's \"Great Chain of Being\" after 40 years, describes it as \"a familiar feature of the intellectual landscape\", indicating its great influence and \"brisk\" ongoing sales. Bynum argues that much more research is needed into how the concept of the great chain of being was replaced, but he agrees that Lovejoy was right that the crucial period was the end of the 18th century when \"the Enlightenment's chain of being was dismantled\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3408", "title": "Baruch Spinoza", "text": "Baruch Spinoza\n\nBaruch Spinoza (; ; born Benedito de Espinosa, ; 24 November 1632 – 21 February 1677, later Benedict de Spinoza) was a Jewish-Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Sephardi origin. By laying the groundwork for the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy. Along with René Descartes, Spinoza was a leading philosophical figure of the Dutch Golden Age. Spinoza's given name, which means \"Blessed\", varies among different languages. In Hebrew, it is written . His Portuguese name is . In his Latin works, he used .\n\nSpinoza was raised in a Portuguese-Jewish community in Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine. Jewish religious authorities issued a \"herem\" () against him, causing him to be effectively shunned by Jewish society at age 23. His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's \"Index of Forbidden Books\".\n\nSpinoza lived an outwardly simple life as an optical lens grinder, collaborating on microscope and telescope lens designs with Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens. He turned down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 in 1677 from a lung illness, perhaps tuberculosis or silicosis exacerbated by the inhalation of fine glass dust while grinding lenses. He is buried in the churchyard of the Christian Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague.\n\nSpinoza's \"magnum opus\", the \"Ethics\", was published posthumously in the year of his death. The work opposed Descartes' philosophy of mind–body dualism, and earned Spinoza recognition as one of Western philosophy's most important thinkers. In it, \"Spinoza wrote the last indisputable Latin masterpiece, and one in which the refined conceptions of medieval philosophy are finally turned against themselves and destroyed entirely\". Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel said, \"The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all.\" His philosophical accomplishments and moral character prompted Gilles Deleuze to name him \"the 'prince' of philosophers.\"\n\nSpinoza's ancestors were of Sephardic Jewish descent and were a part of the community of Portuguese Jews that had settled in the city of Amsterdam in the wake of the Portuguese Inquisition (1536), which had resulted in forced conversions and expulsions from the Iberian Peninsula. Attracted by the Decree of Toleration issued in 1579 by the Union of Utrecht, Portuguese converts to Catholicism first sailed to Amsterdam in 1593 and promptly reconverted to Judaism. In 1598, permission was granted to build a synagogue, and in 1615 an ordinance for the admission and government of the Jews was passed. As a community of exiles, the Portuguese Jews of Amsterdam were highly proud of their identity.\n\nAlthough the Portuguese name \"de Espinosa\" or \"Espinosa,\" then spelled with a \"z,\" can be confused with the Spanish \"de Espinoza\" or \"Espinoza,\" there is no evidence in Spinoza's genealogy that his family came from Espinosa de los Monteros, near Burgos, or from Espinosa de Cerrato, near Palencia, both in Northern Castile, Spain. Still, this was a common Portuguese \"conversos\" family name.\n\nSpinoza's father was born roughly a century after the forced conversions in the small Portuguese city of Vidigueira, near Beja in Alentejo. When Spinoza's father Miguel (Michael) was still a child, Spinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Spinoza, who was from Lisbon, took his family to Nantes in France. They were expelled in 1615 and moved to Rotterdam, where Isaac died in 1627. Spinoza's father and his uncle Manuel then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed the practice of Judaism. Miguel was a successful merchant and became a warden of the synagogue and of the Amsterdam Jewish school. He buried three wives and three of his six children died before reaching adulthood.\n\nAmsterdam and Rotterdam operated as important cosmopolitan centres where merchant ships from many parts of the world brought people of various customs and beliefs. This flourishing commercial activity encouraged a culture relatively tolerant of the play of new ideas, to a considerable degree sheltered from the censorious hand of ecclesiastical authority (though those considered to have gone \"too far\" might have gotten persecuted even in the Netherlands). Not by chance were the philosophical works of both Descartes and Spinoza developed in the cultural and intellectual background of the Dutch Republic in the 17th century. Spinoza may have had access to a circle of friends who were unconventional in terms of social tradition, including members of the Collegiants. One of the people he knew was Niels Stensen, a brilliant Danish student in Leiden; others included Albert Burgh, with whom Spinoza is known to have corresponded.\n\nBenedito de Espinoza was born on 24 November 1632 in the Jodenbuurt in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was the second son of Miguel de Espinoza, a successful, although not wealthy, Portuguese Sephardic Jewish merchant in Amsterdam. His mother, Ana Débora, Miguel's second wife, died when Baruch was only six years old. Spinoza's mother tongue was Portuguese, although he also knew Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch, perhaps French, and later Latin. Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned the language only late in his youth.\n\nSpinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah yeshiva of the Amsterdam Talmud Torah congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi Saul Levi Morteira. His teachers also included the less traditional Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel, \"a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of Vossius, Grotius, and Rembrandt\". While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum. Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.\n\nThe precise date of Spinoza's first studies of Latin with Francis van den Enden (Franciscus van den Enden) is not known. Some state it began as early as 1654-1655, when Spinoza was 20; others note that the documentary record only attests to his presence in van den Enden's circle around 1657–58. Van den Enden was a notorious free thinker, former Jesuit, and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and modern philosophy, including that of Descartes. (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a Cartesian and atheist, and his books were put on the Catholic Index of Banned Books.)\n\nSpinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21. He duly recited Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning, for eleven months as required by Jewish law. When his sister Rebekah disputed his inheritance, he took her to court to establish his claim, won his case, but then renounced his claim in her favour.\n\nSpinoza adopted the Latin name Benedictus de Spinoza, began boarding with Van den Enden, and began teaching in his school. Following an anecdote in an early biography by Johannes Colerus, he is said to have fallen in love with his teacher's daughter, Clara, but she rejected him for a richer student. (This story has been discounted on the basis that Clara Maria van den Enden was born in 1643 and would have been no more than about 13 years old when Spinoza left Amsterdam. In 1671 she married Dirck Kerckring.)\n\nDuring this period Spinoza also became acquainted with the Collegiants, an anti-clerical sect of Remonstrants with tendencies towards rationalism, and with the Mennonites who had existed for a century but were close to the Remonstrants. Many of his friends belonged to dissident Christian groups which met regularly as discussion groups and which typically rejected the authority of established churches as well as traditional dogmas.\n\nSpinoza's break with the prevailing dogmas of Judaism, and particularly the insistence on non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, was not sudden; rather, it appears to have been the result of a lengthy internal struggle: \"If anyone thinks my criticism [regarding the authorship of the Bible] is of too sweeping a nature and lacking sufficient foundation, I would ask him to undertake to show us in these narratives a definite plan such as might legitimately be imitated by historians in their chronicles... If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery. Indeed, I may add that I write nothing here that is not the fruit of lengthy reflection; and although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture, I have felt bound in the end to embrace the views I here express.\"\n\nNevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authority became more pronounced. For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise. He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting \"Heretic!\" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1654, Spinoza and his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham) ran the family importing business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the First Anglo-Dutch War. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors. In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).\n\nSpinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by Descartes, and to optics.\n\nOn 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of \"cherem\" (Hebrew: , a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or excommunication) against the 23-year-old Spinoza. The following document translates the official record of the censure:\n\nThe Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and borne witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable \"chachamin\" [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four ells of him, or read anything composed or written by him.\nThe Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual. The language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam. The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated. The censure refers only to the \"abominable heresies that he practised and taught,\" to his \"monstrous deeds,\" and to the testimony of witnesses \"in the presence of the said Espinoza.\" There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.\n\nFirst, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: \"No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?\"\n\nSecond, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former \"conversos\" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion. There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But \"in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law.\" Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might \"disturb the liberty we enjoy.\" Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.\n\nThird, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his \"Theological-Political Treatise\" that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the \"monstrous deed,\" contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: \"Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal.\" Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.\n\nAfter the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an \"Apology\" (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, \"in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances.\" This \"Apology\" does not survive, but some of its contents may later have been included in his \"Theological-Political Treatise\". For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval Biblical commentator Abraham ibn Ezra intimating that some apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i.e., \"[t]he Canaanite was then in the land,\" Genesis 12:6, which ibn Ezra called a \"mystery\" and exhorted those \"who understand it [to] keep silent\") were not of Mosaic authorship as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent.\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity. Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants (a Christian sect of Remonstrants) and Quakers, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian Protestant graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass or Quaker meeting. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.\n\nIn September 2012, the Portugees-Israëlietische Gemeente te Amsterdam asked the chief rabbi of their community Haham Pinchas Toledano to reconsider the cherem after consulting several Spinoza experts. However he declined to remove it, citing Spinoza's \"preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion\".\n\nSpinoza spent his remaining 21 years writing and studying as a private scholar.\n\nSpinoza believed in a \"Philosophy of tolerance and benevolence\" and actually lived the life which he preached. He was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged atheism. However, even those who were against him \"had to admit he lived a saintly life\". Besides the religious controversies, nobody really had much bad to say about Spinoza other than, \"he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies\".\n\nAfter the cherem, the Amsterdam municipal authorities expelled Spinoza from Amsterdam, \"responding to the appeals of the rabbis, and also of the Calvinist clergy, who had been vicariously offended by the existence of a free thinker in the synagogue\". He spent a brief time in or near the village of Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, but returned soon afterwards to Amsterdam and lived there quietly for several years, giving private philosophy lessons and grinding lenses, before leaving the city in 1660 or 1661.\n\nDuring this time in Amsterdam, Spinoza wrote his \"Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being\", which he never published in his lifetime—assuming with good reason that it might get suppressed. Two Dutch translations of it survive, discovered about 1810.\"\n\nSpinoza moved around 1660 or 1661 from Amsterdam to Rijnsburg (near Leiden), the headquarters of the Collegiants. In Rijnsburg, he began work on his \"Descartes' \"Principles of Philosophy\"\" as well as on his masterpiece, the \"Ethics\". In 1663, he returned briefly to Amsterdam, where he finished and published \"Descartes' \"Principles of Philosophy,\"\" the only work published in his lifetime under his own name, and then moved the same year to Voorburg.\n\nIn Voorburg, Spinoza continued work on the \"Ethics\" and corresponded with scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout Europe. He also wrote and published his \"Theological Political Treatise\" in 1670, in defence of secular and constitutional government, and in support of Jan de Witt, the Grand Pensionary of the Netherlands, against the Stadtholder, the Prince of Orange. Leibniz visited Spinoza and claimed that Spinoza's life was in danger when supporters of the Prince of Orange murdered de Witt in 1672. While published anonymously, the work did not long remain so, and de Witt's enemies characterized it as \"forged in Hell by a renegade Jew and the Devil, and issued with the knowledge of Jan de Witt.\" It was condemned in 1673 by the Synod of the Reformed Church and formally banned in 1674.\n\nSpinoza earned a modest living from lens-grinding and instrument making, yet he was involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist Christiaan Huygens and mathematician Johannes Hudde, including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favouring small objectives and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40 ft. telescope which would have been one of the largest in Europe at the time. The quality of Spinoza's lenses was much praised by Christiaan Huygens, among others. In fact, his technique and instruments were so esteemed that Constantijn Huygens ground a \"clear and bright\" 42 ft. telescope lens in 1687 from one of Spinoza's grinding dishes, ten years after his death. The exact type of lenses that Spinoza made are not known, but very likely included lenses for both the microscope and telescope. He was said by anatomist Theodor Kerckring to have produced an \"excellent\" microscope, the quality of which was the foundation of Kerckring's anatomy claims. During his time as a lens and instrument maker, he was also supported by small but regular donations from close friends.\n\nIn 1670, Spinoza moved to The Hague where he lived on a small pension from Jan de Witt and a small annuity from the brother of his dead friend, Simon de Vries. He worked on the \"Ethics\", wrote an unfinished Hebrew grammar, began his \"Political Treatise\", wrote two scientific essays (\"On the Rainbow\" and \"On the Calculation of Chances\"), and began a Dutch translation of the Bible (which he later destroyed by burning).\n\nSpinoza was offered the chair of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg, but he refused it, perhaps because of the possibility that it might in some way curb his freedom of thought.\n\nIn 1676, Spinoza met with Leibniz at The Hague for a discussion of his principal philosophical work, \"Ethics\", which had been completed in 1676. This meeting was described in Matthew Stewart's \"The Courtier and the Heretic\".\n\nSpinoza's health began to fail in 1676, and he died on 21 February 1677 at the age of 44. His premature death was said to be due to lung illness, possibly silicosis as a result of breathing in glass dust from the lenses that he ground. Later, a shrine was made of his home in The Hague.\n\nTextbooks and encyclopaedias often depict Spinoza as a solitary soul who eked out a living as a lens grinder; in reality, he had many friends but kept his needs to a minimum. He preached a philosophy of tolerance and benevolence. Anthony Gottlieb described him as living \"a saintly life.\" Reviewer M. Stuart Phelps noted, \"No one has ever come nearer to the ideal life of the philosopher than Spinoza.\" Harold Bloom wrote, \"As a teacher of reality, he practised his own wisdom, and was surely one of the most exemplary human beings ever to have lived.\" According to \"The New York Times\": \"In outward appearance he was unpretending, but not careless. His way of living was exceedingly modest and retired; often he did not leave his room for many days together. He was likewise almost incredibly frugal; his expenses sometimes amounted only to a few pence a day.\" Bloom writes of Spinoza, \"He appears to have had no sexual life.\"\n\nSpinoza also corresponded with Peter Serrarius, a radical Protestant and millenarian merchant. Serrarius was a patron to Spinoza after Spinoza left the Jewish community and even had letters sent and received for the philosopher to and from third parties. Spinoza and Serrarius maintained their relationship until Serrarius' death in 1669. By the beginning of the 1660s, Spinoza's name became more widely known, and eventually Gottfried Leibniz and Henry Oldenburg paid him visits, as stated in Matthew Stewart's \"The Courtier and the Heretic\". Spinoza corresponded with Oldenburg for the rest of his short life.\n\nThe writings of René Descartes have been described as \"Spinoza's starting point.\" Spinoza's first publication was his 1663 geometric exposition of proofs using Euclid's model with definitions and axioms of Descartes' \"Principles of Philosophy\". Spinoza has been associated with Leibniz and Descartes as \"rationalists\" in contrast to \"empiricists.\"\n\nSpinoza engaged in correspondence from December 1664 to June 1665 with Willem van Blijenbergh, an amateur Calvinist theologian, who questioned Spinoza on the definition of evil. Later in 1665, Spinoza notified Oldenburg that he had started to work on a new book, the \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", published in 1670. Leibniz disagreed harshly with Spinoza in his own manuscript \"Refutation of Spinoza,\" but he is also known to have met with Spinoza on at least one occasion (as mentioned above), and his own work bears some striking resemblances to specific important parts of Spinoza's philosophy (see: Monadology).\n\nWhen the public reactions to the anonymously published \"Theologico-Political Treatise\" were extremely unfavourable to his brand of Cartesianism, Spinoza was compelled to abstain from publishing more of his works. Wary and independent, he wore a signet ring which he used to mark his letters and which was engraved with the word \"caute\" (Latin for \"cautiously\") underneath a rose, itself a symbol of secrecy. \"For, having chosen to write in a language that was so widely intelligible, he was compelled to hide what he had written.\"\n\nThe \"Ethics\" and all other works, apart from the \"Descartes' Principles of Philosophy\" and the \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", were published after his death in the \"Opera Posthuma\", edited by his friends in secrecy to avoid confiscation and destruction of manuscripts. The \"Ethics\" contains many still-unresolved obscurities and is written with a forbidding mathematical structure modelled on Euclid's geometry and has been described as a \"superbly cryptic masterwork.\"\n\nIn a letter, written in December 1675 and sent to Albert Burgh, who wanted to defend Catholicism, Spinoza clearly explained his view of both Catholicism and Islam. He stated that both religions are made \"to deceive the people and to constrain the minds of men\". He also states that Islam far surpasses Catholicism in doing so.\n\nSpinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal. Spinoza's view of God is what Charles Hartshorne describes as Classical Pantheism. Spinoza has also been described as an \"Epicurean materialist,\" specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally. Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on quantum mechanics. Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical thought, offering powerful weapons for prevailing against \"received authority.\" He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality that surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely a single, fundamental substance (meaning \"that which stands beneath\" rather than \"matter\") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser \"entities\" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause-and-effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published \"Ethics.\" Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have free will, he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they desire what they desire and act as they do.\n\nSpinoza contends that \"Deus sive Natura\" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality then seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same Substance. It is important to note that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the \"Ethics,\" Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests and denies dualism. The universal Substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the mind–body problem known as neutral monism. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence, by which it can and does make changes, but a God that is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that \"things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,\"; he directly challenges a transcendental God that actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause-and-effect, which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God provides the best response to the world around them.\nNot only is it impossible for two infinite Substances to exist (two infinities being absurd), God as the ultimate Substance cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental, all-pervasive Substance.\n\nSpinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know that we are determined and to understand \"why\" we act as we do. By forming more \"adequate\" ideas about what we do and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This process allows us to become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.\nTherefore, humans have no free will, despite strongly believing that they do. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free, but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: \"men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined.\"\n\nThis picture of Spinoza's determinism is illuminated by this famous quote in \"Ethics\": ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are nonexistent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false idea of choice predicated upon this.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy has much in common with Stoicism inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. Spinoza, however, differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: He utterly rejected their contention that reason could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis.\n\nSpinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing. Encapsulated at the start in his \"Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding\" (\"Tractatus de intellectus emendatione\") is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be relative concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which \"All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection.\" Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is contingent.\n\nGiven Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where \"necessity\" reigns, Good and Evil have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.\n\nIn the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God or Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of \"conatus\" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.\n\nAlso in the \"Ethics\", Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be \"mutilated, confused, and without order.\" Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a \"passive\" state. This type of \"passive mind\" that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.\nSpinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.\nSpinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue.\n\nIn the final part of the \"Ethics\", his concern with the meaning of \"true blessedness\", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external causes in order to master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.\n\nIt is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe. He has therefore been called the \"prophet\" and \"prince\" and most eminent expounder of pantheism. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, \"as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a \"mode\" under two \"attributes\" of Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.\n\nAccording to German philosopher Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote ' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not \"\" (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence. Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course \"divisible\"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, \"no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided\", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, \"a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible\" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13). Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula \"One and All\" would apply to Spinoza only if the \"One\" preserves its transcendence and the \"All\" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.\n\nMartial Guéroult (1891–1976) suggested the term \"panentheism\", rather than \"pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \"in\" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God. However, American panentheist philosopher Charles Hartshorne (1897–2000) insisted on the term Classical Pantheism to describe Spinoza's view.\n\nIn 1785, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after Gotthold Lessing was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a \"Spinozist\", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an atheist. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Moses Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between theism and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.\n\nThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\nBy 1879, Spinoza’s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.\n\nSpinoza's \"God or Nature\" (\"Deus sive Natura\") provided a living, natural God, in contrast to Isaac Newton's first cause argument and the dead mechanism of Julien Offray de La Mettrie's (1709–1751) work, \"Man a Machine\" (\")\". Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a \"religion of nature\". Novalis called him the \"God-intoxicated man\". Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay \"The Necessity of Atheism\".\n\nSpinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word \"God\" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. \"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...\" Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.\n\nAccording to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", Spinoza's God is an \"infinite intellect\" (\"Ethics\" 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends \"amor intellectualis dei\" (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that \"neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God\" (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. \"He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,\" says Spinoza (5p19).\n\nSteven Nadler suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.\n\nSimilarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodor Goldstücker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was ... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.\n\nMax Müller, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying \"the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.\" Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay \"As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.\"\n\nEurope in the 19th and 20th centuries grew even more interested in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or Marxist perspective. Karl Marx liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as materialistic. The philosophers Louis Althusser, Gilles Deleuze, Antonio Negri and Étienne Balibar have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, calls him \"the prince of philosophers\". Nietzsche esteemed few philosophers, but he esteemed Spinoza. However, Nietzsche never read Spinoza's works themselves, but learned about Spinoza from Kuno Fischer's \"History of Modern Philosophy\".\n\nWhen George Santayana graduated from college, he published an essay, \"The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza\", in \"The Harvard Monthly\". Later, he wrote an introduction to \"Spinoza's Ethics and \"De intellectus emendatione\"\". In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as \"Ultimate Religion\") at a meeting at The Hague celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his \"master and model\" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.\n\nPhilosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by G. E. Moore) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", an allusion to Spinoza's \"Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\". Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression \"sub specie aeternitatis\" from Spinoza (\"Notebooks, 1914-16\", p. 83). The structure of his \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's \"Ethics\" (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own \"Tractatus\") in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that \"If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.\" (6.4311) \"The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole.\" (6.45)\n\nLeo Strauss dedicated his first book, \"Spinoza's Critique of Religion\", to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity. More recently Jonathan Israel argued that, from 1650 to 1750, Spinoza was \"the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority.\"\n\nSpinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy.\nPBS television series, Jeeves and Wooster (1993) Season 4 Episode 2 has Spinoza as a central part of the plot. This episode draws on the book Joy in the Morning by PG Wodehouse which also includes Jeeves desire to own a copy of the latest edition of Spinoza’s work.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32255505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32255505", "title": "Bechdel test", "text": "Bechdel test\n\nThe Bechdel test ( ) is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.\n\nAbout half of all films meet these criteria, according to user-edited databases and the media industry press. The test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in films and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction.\n\nAlso known as the Bechdel–Wallace test, it is named after the American cartoonist Alison Bechdel, in whose comic strip, \"Dykes to Watch Out For\", the test first appeared, in 1985. Bechdel credited the idea to a friend, Liz Wallace, and to the writings of Virginia Woolf. After the test became more widely discussed in the 2000s, a number of variants and tests inspired by it have been introduced.\n\nIn her 1929 essay \"A Room of One's Own\", Virginia Woolf observed about the literature of her time what the Bechdel test would later highlight in more recent fiction:\n\nIn film, a study of gender portrayals in 855 of the most financially successful U.S. films from 1950 to 2006 showed that there were, on average, two male characters for each female character, a ratio that remained stable over time. Female characters were portrayed as being involved in sex twice as often as male characters, and their proportion of scenes with explicit sexual content increased over time. Violence increased over time in male and female characters alike.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, in 120 films made worldwide from 2010 to 2013, only 31% of named characters were female, and 23% of the films had a female protagonist or co-protagonist. 7% of directors were women. Another study looking at the 700 top‐grossing films from 2007 to 2014 found that only 30% of the speaking characters were female. In a 2016 analysis of screenplays of 2,005 commercially successful films, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels found that in 82% of the films, men had two of the top three speaking roles, while a woman had the most dialogue in only 22% of films.\n\nThe rules now known as the Bechdel test first appeared in 1985 in Alison Bechdel's comic strip \"Dykes To Watch Out For\". In a strip titled \"The Rule\", two women, who resemble the future characters Mo and Ginger, discuss seeing a film and one woman explains that she only goes to a movie if it satisfies the following requirements:\n\nThe other woman acknowledges that the idea is pretty strict, but good. Not finding any films that meet their requirements, they go home together.\n\nThe test has also been referred to as the \"Bechdel–Wallace test\" (which Bechdel herself prefers), the \"Bechdel rule\", \"Bechdel's law\", or the \"Mo Movie Measure\". Bechdel credited the idea for the test to a friend and karate training partner, Liz Wallace, whose name appears in the marquee of the strip. She later wrote that she was pretty certain that Wallace was inspired by Virginia Woolf's essay \"A Room of One's Own\".\n\nOriginally meant as \"a little lesbian joke in an alternative feminist newspaper\", according to Bechdel, the test moved into mainstream criticism in the 2010s and has been described as \"the standard by which feminist critics judge television, movies, books, and other media\". In 2013, an Internet newspaper described it as \"almost a household phrase, common shorthand to capture whether a film is woman-friendly\". The failure of major Hollywood productions such as \"Pacific Rim\" (2013) to pass the test was addressed in depth in the media.\n\nAccording to Neda Ulaby, the test resonates because \"it articulates something often missing in popular culture: not the number of women we see on screen, but the depth of their stories, and the range of their concerns.\" Dean Spade and Craig Willse described the test as a \"commentary on how media representations enforce harmful gender norms\" by depicting women's relationships to men more than any other relationships, and women's lives as important only insofar as they relate to men.\n\nSeveral variants of the test have been proposed—for example, that the two women must be named characters, or that there must be at least a total of 60 seconds of conversation. The test has also attracted academic interest from a computational analysis approach. In June 2018, the Bechdel test was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nIn 2013, four Swedish cinemas and the Scandinavian cable television channel Viasat Film incorporated the Bechdel test into some of their ratings, a move supported by the Swedish Film Institute.\n\nIn 2014, the European cinema fund Eurimages incorporated the Bechdel test into its submission mechanism as part of an effort to collect information about gender equality in its projects. It requires \"a Bechdel analysis of the script to be supplied by the script readers\".\n\nIn 2018, screenwriting software developers began incorporating functions that allow writers to analyze their scripts for gender representation. Software with such functions includes Highland 2, WriterDuet and the forthcoming Final Draft 11.\n\nIn addition to films, the Bechdel test has been applied to other media such as video games and comics. In theater, British actor Beth Watson launched a \"Bechdel Theatre\" campaign in 2015 that aims to highlight test-passing plays.\n\nThe website \"bechdeltest.com\" is a user-edited database of some 6,500 films classified by whether they pass the test, with the added requirement that the women must be \"named\" characters. , it listed 58% of these films as passing all three of the test's requirements, 10% as failing one, 22% as failing two, and 10% as failing all three.\n\nAccording to Mark Harris of \"Entertainment Weekly\", if passing the test were mandatory, it would have jeopardized half of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Picture nominees. The news website \"Vocativ\", when subjecting the top-grossing films of 2013 to the Bechdel test, concluded that roughly half of them passed (although some dubiously) and the other half failed.\n\nWriter Charles Stross noted that about half of the films that \"do\" pass the test only do so because the women talk about marriage or babies. Works that fail the test include some that are mainly about or aimed at women, or which do feature prominent female characters. The television series \"Sex and the City\" highlights its own failure to pass the test by having one of the four female main characters ask: \"How does it happen that four such smart women have nothing to talk about but boyfriends? It's like seventh grade with bank accounts!\"\n\n\"Vocativ\"s authors also found that the films from 2013 that passed the test earned a total of $4.22 billion in the United States, while those that failed earned $2.66 billion in total, leading them to conclude that a way for Hollywood to make more money might be to \"put more women onscreen.\" A 2014 study by FiveThirtyEight based on data from about 1,615 films released from 1990 to 2013 concluded that the median budget of films that passed the test was 35% lower than that of the others. It found that the films that passed the test had about a 37 percent higher return on investment (ROI) in the United States, and the same ROI internationally, compared to films that did not pass the test.\n\nExplanations that have been offered as to why many films fail the Bechdel test include the relative lack of gender diversity among scriptwriters and other movie professionals, also called the \"celluloid ceiling\": In 2012, only one in six of the directors, writers, and producers behind the 100 most commercially successful movies in the United States was a woman.\n\nWriting in \"National Review\" in 2017, film critic Kyle Smith suggested that the reason for the Bechdel test results was that \"Hollywood movies are about people on the extremes of society — cops, criminals, superheroes — [which] tend to be men\", and that such films were more often created by men because \"women's movie ideas\", mostly about relationships according to Smith, \"aren't commercial enough for Hollywood studios\". He considered the Bechdel test just as meaningless as a test asking whether a film contained cowboys. Smith's article provoked vigorous criticism. Alessandra Maldonado and Liz Bourke wrote that Smith was wrong to contend that female authors do not write books that generate \"big movie ideas\", citing J. K. Rowling, Margaret Atwood and Nnedi Okorafor among others as counter-examples.\n\nThe Bechdel test only indicates whether women are present in a work of fiction to a certain degree. A work may pass the test and still contain sexist content, and a work with prominent female characters may fail the test. A work may fail the test for reasons unrelated to gender bias, such as because its setting works against the inclusion of women (e.g., Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\", set in a medieval monastery). What counts as a character or as a conversation is not defined (e.g., the Sir Mix-a-Lot song \"Baby Got Back\" has been described as passing the Bechdel test, because it begins with audio of a valley girl saying \"oh my god, Becky, look at her butt\") and works with very few of either will often fail the test automatically.\n\nIn an attempt at a quantitative analysis of works as to whether they pass the test, at least one researcher, Faith Lawrence, noted that the results depend on how rigorously the test is applied. One of the questions arising from its application is whether a reference to a man at any point within a conversation that also covers other topics invalidates the entire exchange. If not, the question remains how one defines the start and end of a conversation.\n\nIn response to its increasing ubiquity in film criticism, the Bechdel test has been criticized for not taking into account the quality of the works it tests (bad films may pass it, and good ones fail), or as a \"nefarious plot to make all movies conform to feminist dogma\". According to Andi Zeisler, this criticism indicates the problem that the test's utility \"has been elevated way beyond the original intention. Where Bechdel and Wallace expressed it as simply a way to point out the rote, unthinkingly normative plotlines of mainstream film, these days passing it has somehow become synonymous with 'being feminist'. It was never meant to be a measure of feminism, but rather a cultural barometer.\" Zeisler noted that the false assumption that a work that passes the test is \"feminist\" might lead to creators \"gaming the system\" by adding just enough women characters and dialogue to pass the test, while continuing to deny women substantial representation outside of formulaic plots.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Telegraph\" film critic Robbie Collin disapproved of the test as prizing \"box-ticking and stat-hoarding over analysis and appreciation\", and suggested that the underlying problem of the lack of well-drawn female characters in film ought to be a topic of discourse, rather than individual films failing or passing the Bechdel test. \"FiveThirtyEight\"s writer Walt Hickey noted that the test does not measure whether any one film is a model of gender equality, and that passing it does not ensure the quality of writing, significance or depth of female roles—but, he wrote, \"it's the best test on gender equity in film we have—and, perhaps more important ..., the only test we have data on\".\n\nNina Power wrote that the test raises the questions of whether fiction has a duty to represent women (rather than to pursue whatever the creator's own agenda might be) and to be \"realistic\" in the representation of women. She also wrote that it remained to be determined how often real life passes the Bechdel test, and what the influence of fiction on that might be.\n\nThe Bechdel test has inspired others, notably feminist and antiracist critics and fans, to formulate criteria for evaluating works of fiction, in part because of the Bechdel test's limitations. In interviews conducted by FiveThirtyEight, women in the film and television industry proposed many other tests that included more women, better stories, women behind the scenes, and more diversity.\n\nThe \"Mako Mori test\", formulated by Tumblr user \"Chaila\" and named after the only significant female character of the 2013 film \"Pacific Rim\", asks whether a female character has a narrative arc that is not about supporting a man's story. (In the sequel Pacific Rim Uprising, Mori failed the test by dying a few minutes into the film to further her brother's story.) Comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick proposed a \"sexy lamp test\": \"If you can replace your female character with a sexy lamp and the story still basically works, maybe you need another draft.\"\n\nThe \"Sphinx test\" by the Sphinx theater company of London asks about the interaction of women with other characters, as well as how prominently women characters feature in the action, how proactive rather than reactive they are, and whether they are portrayed stereotypically. It was conceived to \"encourage theatremakers to think about how to write more and better roles for women\", in reaction to research indicating that only 37% of theater roles were written for women .\n\nThe \"Vito Russo test\" created by the LGBT organization GLAAD tests for the representation of LGBT characters in films. It asks: Does the film contain a character that is identifiably LGBT, and is not solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity, as well as tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect?\n\nA test proposed by TV critic Eric Deggans asks whether a film that is not about race has at least two non-white characters in the main cast, and similarly, writer Nikesh Shukla proposed a test about whether there are two main characters who are people of color, who talk to each other without mentioning their race.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" film critic Manohla Dargis suggested in January 2016 the \"DuVernay test\", (named for director Ava DuVernay) asking whether \"African-Americans and other minorities have fully realized lives rather than serve as scenery in white stories.\" It aims to point out the lack of people of color in Hollywood movies, through a measure of their importance to a particular movie or the lack of a gratuitous link to white actors.\n\nNadia Latif and Leila Latif of \"The Guardian\" have suggested a series of five questions:\n\nA simplified version by Nikesh Shukla, already proposed in 2013, asks if \"two ethnic minorities talk to each other for more than five minutes about something other than race.\"\n\nThe Bechdel test has also inspired gender-related tests for nonfiction. Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, proposed a Bechdel test for software. Source code passes this test if it contains a function written by a woman developer which calls a function written by a different woman developer. Press notice was attracted after the U.S. government agency 18F analyzed their own software according to this metric.\n\nThe Bechdel test also inspired the Finkbeiner test, a checklist to help journalists to avoid gender bias in articles about women in science.\n\n"}

She graduated from Mount St. Mary's University in 1994 with a bachelor of arts degree in political science.\nShe began her government career by working as a legislative aide to Assemblyman David C. Russo, later becoming Russo's chief of staff. In 2010, Kelly became Director of Legislative Relations under Governor Chris Christie. In April 2013, Christie appointed her to be his Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Kelly was convicted for her involvement in the \"Bridgegate\" affair. She was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment on March 29, 2017.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Kelly was found guilty in connection with the four-day closures of entrance ramps to the George Washington Bridge in the late summer of 2013, in part of what has been described as politically motivated retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n\nOn August 13, 2013, Kelly sent an eight-word e-mail to David Wildstein, a Christie appointee to the board of commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, that read, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Wildstein responded to Kelly's e-mail: \"Got it.\" In a texting exchange the next day, Wildstein relayed to Kelly a text from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich in which he complained about the traffic jam and said, \"The bigger problem is getting kids to school. Please help. It's maddening.\" Kelly replied, \"Is it wrong that I'm smiling?\"\n\nOn January 9, 2014, after the emails were disclosed, the governor announced that he had fired Kelly, calling her action \"stupid\" and \"deceitful\" and claiming her actions had caused him to mislead the public. That day, Kelly was named as a defendant in a federal class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey that cited a civil conspiracy and \"willful, wanton, arbitrary, and egregious official misconduct\". In the wake of her firing, police established no parking zones outside of Kelly's home in Ramsey to keep press and gawkers away, while \"no trespassing\" signs were placed on the lawn of the home.\n\nWhen she received subpoenas for documents from the New Jersey legislative committee, Kelly's attorneys indicated she would not comply with the subpoenas, citing their clients' Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure The committee voted to compel Kelly to produce the previously requested documents, instructing special counsel Reid Schar to \"take all necessary steps\" to enforce them. But Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson found no basis to force Kelly and Bill Stepien, the governor's two-time campaign manager, to comply with the subpoenas. The pair had objected to the requests, issued in January, asserting that being forced to identify and turn over records would violate their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. They called the committee's requests a fishing expedition. The Court agreed.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, Kelly was indicted on nine charges in connection with her involvement in the scandal. She pleaded not guilty. Courts have ruled that evidence provided in discovery by the US Attorney cannot be made public. Courts also ruled that all materials used to prepare the so-called Mastro Report which exonerated the Christie administration must be turned over to the defense. The state has denied Kelly's request for reimbursement of legal fees.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, the jury in the \"Bridgegate\" trial returned guilty verdicts on all counts against Bridget Kelly and co-defendant Bill Baroni. On March 29, 2017, U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton sentenced to Kelly 18 months in prison and 500 hours of community service.\n\nOn November 27, 2018, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the majority of the convictions, overturning the determination that Kelly and Baroni had violated the civil rights of travelers, finding there is no established civil right to interstate travel giving rise to a criminal conviction.\n\nAs of 2014, Kelly was unemployed, and a divorced mother with four children.\n"}

The phrase is not generally regarded as pejorative. The idiom, as used in Australia and New Zealand, reached the United States in the 1920s probably after exposure to Australian troops on the Western Front during World War I, and is recorded in the UK since 1944.\n\nIts origin is possibly from 19th century American maritime humour and the difficulty of trying to steer a vessel in reverse. A ship's stern is flat and lacks the pointed structure of a bow, and a ship is therefore difficult to maneuver in reverse when using the rudder, also found on the stern. The reverse maneuvering was accomplished therefore through shouted instructions from the wharf to the wheelhouse, via intermediary deckhands. Such communication was prone to misunderstanding owing to the wide variety of nationalities employed on United States merchant vessels during the 19th century.\n\n"}
{"id": "5976304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5976304", "title": "Calmness", "text": "Calmness\n\nCalmness is the mental state of peace of mind being free from agitation, excitement, or disturbance. It also refers being in a state of serenity, tranquillity, or peace. Calmness can most easily occur for the average person during a state of relaxation, but it can also be found during much more alert and aware states. Some people find that focusing the mind on something external, or even internal, such as the breathing, can itself be very calming.\n\nCalmness is a quality that can be cultivated and increased with practice. It usually takes a trained mind to stay calm in the face of a great deal of different stimulation, and possible distractions, especially emotional ones. The negative emotions are the greatest challenge to someone who is attempting to cultivate a calm mind. Some disciplines that promote and develop calmness are prayer, yoga, relaxation training, breath training, and meditation. Jon Kabat-Zinn states that “Concentration is a cornerstone of mindfulness practice. Your mindfulness will only be as robust as the capacity of your mind to be calm and stable. Without calmness, the mirror of mindfulness will have an agitated and choppy surface and will not be able to reflect things with any accuracy.” \n\nAnother term usually associated with calmness is \"Peace\". A mind that is at peace or calm will cause the brain to produce \"good\" hormones, which in turn give the person a stable emotional state and promote good health in every area of life, including marriage. Seeing the rise in crime and diseases around the world which are more often than not the consequences of the emotions going 'out-of-control', it is therefore considered beneficial for many to stay calm and cultivate it in every possible situation, especially during stressful events such as demise of a family member or failure in business.\n\nThe term comes from Middle English calme, from Old French, from Old Italian calmo, from Late Latin cauma, \"heat of the day\", the \"resting place in the heat of the day\", from Greek kauma, burning heat, from kaiein, to burn.\n\n"}

This leads to a limited number of \"the usual suspects\" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.\nThe beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.\n\nFurthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail. Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged. Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.\n\nThis media control idea is illustrated in the film documentary, \"\", where journalist Jeff Greenfield explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.\n\nThe 1999 feature film \"The Insider\" has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist Mike Wallace goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on \"60 Minutes\". When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.\n\n"}
{"id": "186123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186123", "title": "Conscience", "text": "Conscience\n\nConscience is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's moral philosophy or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic CNS responses. In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse when a person commits an act that conflicts with their moral values. An individual's moral values and their dissonance with familial, social, cultural and historical interpretations of moral philosophy are considered in the examination of cultural relativity in both the practice and study of psychology. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based on reason has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of modern western philosophy in juxtaposition to the theories of romanticism and other reactionary movements after the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nReligious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with its subject probably learned or imprinted as part of a culture.\n\nCommonly used metaphors for conscience include the \"voice within\", the \"inner light\", or even Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks called his \"daimōnic sign\", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός \"apotreptikos\") inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake. Conscience, as is detailed in sections below, is a concept in national and international law, is increasingly conceived of as applying to the world as a whole, has motivated numerous notable acts for the public good and been the subject of many prominent examples of literature, music and film.\n\nAlthough humanity has no generally accepted definition of conscience or universal agreement about its role in ethical decision-making, three approaches have addressed it:\n\n\nIn the literary traditions of the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita, conscience is the label given to attributes composing knowledge about good and evil, that a soul acquires from the completion of acts and consequent accretion of karma over many lifetimes. According to Adi Shankara in his \"Vivekachudamani\" morally right action (characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward), helps \"purify the heart\" and provide mental tranquility but it alone does not give us \"direct perception of the Reality\". This knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal and eventually a realization in contemplation that the true self merges in a universe of pure consciousness.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian faith, after death a soul must face judgment at the \"Bridge of the Separator\"; there, evil people are tormented by prior denial of their own higher nature, or conscience, and \"to all time will they be guests for the \"House of the Lie\".\" The Chinese concept of Ren, indicates that conscience, along with social etiquette and correct relationships, assist humans to follow \"The Way\" (Tao) a mode of life reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony.\nConscience also features prominently in Buddhism. In the Pali scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of \"conscience\" to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation. Santideva (685–763 CE) wrote in the Bodhicaryavatara (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity, forbearance and training the awareness to be like a \"block of wood\" when attracted by vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption. \"Conscience\" thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness where the mind withdraws from sensory interests and becomes aware of itself as a single whole.\n\nThe Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote in his \"Meditations\" that conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: \"To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness ... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.\"\n\nThe Islamic concept of \"Taqwa\" is closely related to conscience. In the Qur’ān verses 2:197 & 22:37 Taqwa refers to \"right conduct\" or \"piety\", \"guarding of oneself\" or \"guarding against evil\". Qur’ān verse 47:17 says that God is the ultimate source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God. In Qur’ān verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.\n\nQur’ān verse 49:13 states: \"O humankind! We have created you out of male and female and constituted you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā.\" In Islam, according to eminent theologians such as Al-Ghazali, although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the \"Preserved Tablet\"), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the Five Pillars of Islam, deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts. Marshall Hodgson wrote the three-volume work: \"The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization\".\nIn the Protestant Christian tradition, Martin Luther insisted in the Diet of Worms that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: \"[...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein\". Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority. A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.' This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: \"Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?\" Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law. In the Gospel of John (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: \"'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one\" (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.\n\nThis dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was demonstrated dramatically in Antigone's defiance of King Creon's order against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the \"unwritten law\" and to a \"longer allegiance to the dead than to the living\".\n\nCatholic theology sees conscience as the last practical \"judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and to avoid evil\". The Second Vatican Council (1962–65) describes: \"Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths.\" Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but \"the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful\" In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, \"Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters\". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, \"[i]t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed ... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility ... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits.\" Thus, if one realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action. One must first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct judgment. If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly erroneous. It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is correct. The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. For example, some priests make on the use of the so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that \"rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching ... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct\".\nAn example of someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535). A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.\n\nJudaism arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the \"square\" and \"compasses\" explained as providing lessons that Masons should \"square their actions by the square of conscience\", learn to \"circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind.\" The historian Manning Clark viewed \"conscience\" as one of the comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when we suspect that what matters most in life (\"being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for\") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877–1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).\n\nThe secular approach to conscience includes psychological, physiological, sociological, humanitarian, and authoritarian views. Lawrence Kohlberg considered \"critical conscience\" to be an important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans, associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of responsibility, being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with humorous personifications (such as Jiminy Cricket) and later in adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral dilemmas. Erik Erikson placed the development of \"conscience\" in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development. The psychologist Martha Stout terms \"conscience\" \"an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments.\" Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as \"quiet\", \"clear\" and \"easy\".\n\nSigmund Freud regarded \"conscience\" as originating psychologically from the growth of civilisation, which periodically frustrated the external expression of aggression: this destructive impulse being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a superego against the person's own \"ego\" or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood). According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is guilt, which can be a factor in the development of neurosis; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.\n\nAntonio Damasio considers conscience an aspect of extended consciousness beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior.\n\nMichel Glautier argues that conscience is one of the instincts and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.\n\nCharles Darwin considered that \"conscience\" evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the \"greater duration of impression of social instincts\" in the struggle for survival. In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's society (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or \"evil\". Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt in others; being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from society to society and person to person. A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point of view of another person. Persons unable to do this (psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) therefore often act in ways which are \"evil\".\n\nFundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some \"other\" as being \"in a social relationship\". Thus, nationalism is invoked in conscience to quell tribal conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell national conflicts. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual \"conscience\". Friedrich Nietzsche stated: \"communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.' Jeremy Bentham noted that: \"fanaticism never sleeps ... it is never stopped by \"conscience\"; for it has pressed \"conscience\" into its service.\" Hannah Arendt in her study of the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his \"conscience\" to the point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose \"conscience\" did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: \"Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience ... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a \"respectable voice\", with the voice of the respectable society around him\".\n\nSir Arthur Keith in 1948 developed the Amity-enmity complex. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty to save and protect members of the in-group, and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any out-group.\n\nAn interesting area of research in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of animals, whether animals in human society (pets, working animals, even animals grown for food) or in the wild. One idea is that as people or animals perceive a social relationship as important to preserve, their \"conscience\" begins to respect that former \"other\", and urge actions that protect it. Similarly, in complex territorial and cooperative breeding bird communities (such as the Australian magpie) that have a high degree of etiquettes, rules, hierarchies, play, songs and negotiations, rule-breaking seems tolerated on occasions not obviously related to survival of the individual or group; behaviour often appearing to exhibit a touching gentleness and tenderness.\n\nContemporary scientists in evolutionary biology seek to explain conscience as a function of the brain that evolved to facilitate altruism within societies. In his book \"The God Delusion\", Richard Dawkins states that he agrees with Robert Hinde's \"Why Good is Good\", Michael Shermer's \"The Science of Good and Evil\", Robert Buckman's \"Can We Be Good Without God?\" and Marc Hauser's \"Moral Minds\", that our sense of right and wrong can be derived from our Darwinian past. He subsequently reinforced this idea through the lense of the gene-centered view of evolution, since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual organism nor a group, but rather the \"selfish\" gene, and these genes could ensure their own \"selfish\" survival by, \"inter alia\", pushing individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.\n\nNumerous case studies of brain damage have shown that damage to areas of the brain (such as the anterior prefrontal cortex) results in the reduction or elimination of inhibitions, with a corresponding radical change in behaviour. When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.\n\nAttempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the free will necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious mental processes (see Neuroscience of free will and Benjamin Libet) in a scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as the 'readiness potential.'\n\nJacques Pitrat claims that some kind of artificial conscience is beneficial in artificial intelligence systems to improve their long-term performance and direct their introspective processing.\n\nThe word \"conscience\" derives etymologically from the Latin \"conscientia\", meaning \"privity of knowledge\"\nor \"with-knowledge\". The English word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions. Thus \"conscience\" considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined \"gut feeling\" or \"vague sense of guilt\" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person (\"traditional conscience\"). \"Conscience\" may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation (\"critical conscience\"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, \"critical conscience\" can be aided by a \"spark\" of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). \"Conscience\" is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.\n\nThe medieval Islamic scholar and mystic Al-Ghazali divided the concept of \"Nafs\" (soul or self (spirituality)) into three categories based on the Qur’an:\n\n\nThe medieval Persian philosopher and physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi believed in a close relationship between \"conscience\" or spiritual integrity and physical health; rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, use his intellect and apply justice in his life. The medieval Islamic philosopher Avicenna, whilst imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, wrote his famous isolated-but-awake \"Floating Man\" sensory deprivation thought experiment to explore the ideas of human self-awareness and the substantiality of the soul; his hypothesis being that it is through intelligence, particularly the active intellect, that God communicates truth to the human mind or conscience. According to the Islamic Sufis conscience allows Allah to guide people to the marifa, the peace or \"light upon light\" experienced where a Muslim's prayers lead to a melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of God; this foreshadowing the eternal Paradise depicted in the Qur’ān.\n\nSome medieval Christian scholastics such as Bonaventure made a distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind (practical reason) and inner awareness, an intuitive \"spark\" to do good, called \"synderesis\" arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good and when consciously denied (for example to perform an evil act), becoming a source of inner torment. Early modern theologians such as William Perkins and William Ames developed a syllogistic understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term, the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e. casuistry).\n\nIn the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas regarded \"conscience\" as the application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13). Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with synderesis, the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of Natural Law) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles. According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or \"conscientia\" was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the natural law (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (\"Summa Theologiae\", I–II, I). Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue of prudence to explain why some people appear to be less \"morally enlightened\" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.\n\nAquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an evil action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of culpable or vincible ignorance of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of. Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from God) which encouraged human flourishing, rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures. In his \"Commentary\" on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.\n\nThomas A Kempis in the medieval contemplative classic \"The Imitation of Christ\" (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a good conscience. \"Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy.\" The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the \"root and ground\" of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in holy things: \"therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his [or her] conscience.\" The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and contemplative life: \"a free spirit, attracting itself through love\"; \"an intellect enlightened by grace\", \"a delight yielding propension or inclination\" and \"an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of ... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness ... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing.\"\n\nBenedict de Spinoza in his \"Ethics\", published after his death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions \"sub specie aeternitatis\", that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of \"freedom of conscience\" facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the \"constitutional monarch\" and the \"universal moral faculty\": \"conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it.\" Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,\"self-love\" (seeking individual happiness) and second, \"benevolence\" (compassion and seeking good for another) in \"conscience\" (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his \"Table Talk\" expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained \"conscience\" could hinder resolve and practical action; it being \"like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge\".\n\nAs the sacred texts of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as Schopenhauer to hold that in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our \"conscience\", not wishes and thoughts; \"for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will\"; the \"good conscience\", thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification \"that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant, a central figure of the Age of Enlightenment, likewise claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: \"the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me ... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection.\" The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's categorical imperative: \"act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\" Kant considered \"critical conscience\" to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the soul after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss. Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater metaphysical unity. John Plamenatz in his critical examination of Rousseau's work considered that \"conscience\" was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; \"the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature.\"\n\nOther philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the operation of \"conscience\" in society.\nJohn Locke in his \"Essays on the Law of Nature\" argued that the widespread fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state. Locke highlighted the metaethics problem of whether accepting a statement like \"follow your \"conscience\"\" supports subjectivist or objectivist conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: \"if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid.\" Thomas Hobbes likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the basis of \"conscience\" with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth. William Godwin expressed the view that \"conscience\" was a memorable consequence of the \"perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life\" that they possess free will. Adam Smith considered that it was only by developing a \"critical conscience\" that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people. John Stuart Mill believed that idealism about the role of \"conscience\" in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling. Mill held that certain amount of \"conscience\", and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for representative government, but that \"it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good.\"\n\nJosiah Royce (1855–1916) built on the transcendental idealism view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our \"conscience\" also required loyalty to \"a mysterious higher or deeper self.\"\nIn the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with Dietrich Bonhoeffer who stated during his imprisonment by the Nazis in World War II that \"conscience\" for him was more than practical reason, indeed it came from a \"depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself.\" For Bonhoeffer a \"guilty conscience\" arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself. \"Conscience\" for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: \"it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable\". The man with a \"conscience\", he believed, fights a lonely battle against the \"overwhelming forces of inescapable situations\" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences.Simon Soloveychik has similarly claimed that the \"truth\" distributed in the world, as the statement about human dignity, as the affirmation of the line between good and evil, lives in people as conscience.\n\nAs Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad \"conscience\" and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that \"conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home.\" Arendt believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can \"count on its being forgotten the next moment;\" bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from \"conscience\". One reason, she held, was that \"conscience\", as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like \"consciousness\": \"and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the \"lumen naturale\" or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein, as a self-professed adherent of humanism and rationalism, likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one whose \"conscience\" reflects that he \"has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value.\"\nEinstein often referred to the \"inner voice\" as a source of both moral and physical knowledge: \"Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice.\"\n\nSimone Weil who fought for the French resistance (the Maquis) argued in her final book \"The Need for Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind\" that for society to become more just and protective of liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the \"conscience\" of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on human character when fulfilled. Simone Weil also in that work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace associated with a \"good conscience\": \"the liberty of men of goodwill, though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and have not to be rejected.\"\n\nAlternatives to such metaphysical and idealist opinions about conscience arose from realist and materialist perspectives such as those of Charles Darwin. Darwin suggested that \"any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well developed, as in man.\" Émile Durkheim held that the soul and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by totemic ceremonies. AJ Ayer was a more recent realist who held that the existence of \"conscience\" was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing social sciences. George Edward Moore bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or \"conscience\". For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.\n\nThe French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in \"A Very Easy Death\" (\"Une mort très douce\", 1964) reflects within her own \"conscience\" about her mother's attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of others.\n\nMichael Walzer claimed that the growth of religious toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of the men who claimed the rights of conscience. Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people. Ronald Dworkin maintains that constitutional protection of freedom of conscience is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: \"Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease.\" Edward Conze stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely \"repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt.\"\nThe philosopher Peter Singer considers that usually when we describe an action as conscientious in the critical sense we do so in order to deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.\n\nMoral anti-realists debate whether the moral facts necessary to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with \"a posteriori\" necessity; or arise \"a priori\" because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It has also been argued that there is a measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which \"conscience\" must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of \"conscience\" associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of \"conscience\" and its relationship with \"morality\" has been hampered by an \"impetuous\" belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us \"do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self\" and our \"conscience\" is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her \"conscience\"- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in \"conscience\", while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.\n\nJohn Ralston Saul expressed the view in \"The Unconscious Civilization\" that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in turning over their sense of right and wrong, their \"critical conscience\", to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.\n\nSome argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy to act against \"conscience\", even if the judgement of \"conscience\" is likely to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected \"conscience\" for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.\nIn other words, the welcoming of the \"Other\", to Levinas, was the very essence of \"conscience\" properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish freedom of will \"does not have the last word\" and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: \"I am not alone ... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [see a priori and a posteriori] framework-a conceptless experience.\"\n\nEnglish humanist lawyers in the 16th and 17th centuries interpreted conscience as a collection of universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval Roman law-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as Demurrer and Assumpsit that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and wrong on the actual facts. A conscience vote in a parliament allows legislators to vote without restrictions from any political party to which they may belong. In his trial in Jerusalem Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann claimed he was simply following legal orders under paragraph 48 of the German Military Code which provided: \"punishability of an action or omission is not excused on the ground that the person considered his behaviour required by his conscience or the prescripts of his religion\". The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) which is part of international customary law specifically refers to \"conscience\" in Articles 1 and 18. Likewise, the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) mentions \"conscience\" in Article 18.1. It has been argued that these articles provide international legal obligations protecting conscientious objectors from service in the military.\nJohn Rawls in his \"A Theory of Justice\" defines a conscientious objector as an individual prepared to undertake, in public (and often despite widespread condemnation), an action of civil disobedience to a legal rule justifying it (also in public) by reference to contrary foundational social virtues (such as justice as liberty or fairness) and the principles of morality and law derived from them. Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal, warning or admonishment (showing general respect and fidelity to the rule of law by the non-violence and transparency of methods adopted) that a law breaches a community's fundamental virtue of justice. Objections to Rawls' theory include first, its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society's basic appreciation of justice or to emerging moral or ethical principles (such as respect for the rights of the natural environment) which are not yet part of it and second, the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust. \"Conscientious objection\" (also called conscientious refusal or evasion) to obeying a law, should not arise from unreasoning, naive \"traditional conscience\", for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions. Instead it should be based on \"critical conscience' – seriously thought out, conceptually mature, personal moral or religious beliefs held to be fundamentally incompatible (that is, not merely inconsistent on the basis of selfish desires, whim or impulse), for example, either with all laws requiring conscription for military service, or legal compulsion to fight for or financially support the State in a particular war. A famous example arose when Henry David Thoreau the author of Walden was willingly jailed for refusing to pay a tax because he profoundly disagreed with a government policy and was frustrated by the corruption and injustice of the democratic machinery of the state. A more recent case concerned Kimberly Rivera, a private in the US Army and mother of four children who, having served 3 months in Iraq War decided the conflict was immoral and sought refugee status in Canada in 2012 (see List of Iraq War resisters), but was deported and arrested in the US.\n\nIn the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status not just to complete pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors that occurred during the First World War.\n\nAmnesty International organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a prisoner of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was the winner of the 2009 Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.\nExpressed justifications for refusing to obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the historic peace churches are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of conscription that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real democracy. A conscientious objector, however, does not have a primary aim of changing the law. John Dewey considered that conscientious objectors were often the victims of \"moral innocency\" and inexpertness in moral training: \"the moving force of events is always too much for conscience\". The remedy was not to deplore the wickedness of those who manipulate world power, but to connect \"conscience\" with forces moving in another direction- to build institutions and social environments predicated on the rule of law, for example, \"then will conscience itself have compulsive power instead of being forever the martyred and the coerced.\" As an example, Albert Einstein who had advocated \"conscientious objection\" during the First World War and had been a longterm supporter of War Resisters' International reasoned that \"radical pacifism\" could not be justified in the face of Nazi rearmament and advocated a world federalist organization with its own professional army.\nSamuel Johnson pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. \"Conscience\", according to Johnson, was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, \"conscience\" is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before \"conscience\" can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the question should be thoroughly known. \"No man's conscience\", said Johnson \"can tell him the right of another man ... it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man, for the convenience of another.\"\n\nCivil disobedience as non-violent protest or civil resistance are also acts of conscience, but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or a referendum on the issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha (\"satya\" in sanskrit means \"truth and compassion\", \"agraha\" means \"firmness of will\") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued \"If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.\" In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.\n\nNotable historical examples of \"conscientious noncompliance\" in a different professional context included the manipulation of the visa process in 1939 by Japanese Consul-General Chiune Sugihara in Kaunas (the temporary capital of Lithuania between Germany and the Soviet Union) and by Raoul Wallenberg in Hungary in 1944 to allow Jews to escape almost certain death. Ho Feng-Shan the Chinese Consul-General in Vienna in 1939, defied orders from the Chinese ambassador in Berlin to issue Jews with visas for Shanghai. John Rabe a German member of the Nazi Party likewise saved thousands of Chinese from massacre by the Japanese military at Nanking. The White Rose German student movement against the Nazis declared in their 4th leaflet: \"We will not be silent. We are your bad conscience. The White Rose will not leave you in peace!\" \"Conscientious noncompliance\" may be the only practical option for citizens wishing to affirm the existence of an international moral order or 'core' historical rights (such as the right to life, right to a fair trial and freedom of opinion) in states where non-violent protest or civil disobedience are met with prolonged arbitrary detention, torture, forced disappearance, murder or persecution.\nThe controversial Milgram experiment into obedience by Stanley Milgram showed that many people lack the psychological resources to openly resist authority, even when they are directed to act callously and inhumanely against an innocent victim.\n\nWorld conscience is the universalist idea that with ready global communication, all people on earth will no longer be morally estranged from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or geographically; instead they will conceive ethics from the utopian point of view of the universe, eternity or infinity, rather than have their duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the restrictive boundaries of 'blood and territory.'\n\nOften this derives from a spiritual or natural law perspective, that for world peace to be achieved, \"conscience\", properly understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to fundamentalist religious ideologies, but as an aspect of universal consciousness, access to which is the common heritage of humanity. Thinking predicated on the development of \"world conscience\" is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network such as the Findhorn Foundation, international conservation organisations like Fauna and Flora International, as well as performers of world music such as Alan Stivell. Non-government organizations, particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience of the world\n\nEdward O Wilson has developed the idea of consilience to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that \"only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible\". Thus, \"world conscience\" is a concept that overlaps with the Gaia hypothesis in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as global poverty and climate change, through strategies such as environmental ethics, climate ethics, natural conservation, ecology, cosmopolitanism, sustainability and sustainable development, biosequestration and legal protection of the biosphere and biodiversity. The NGO 350.org, for example, seeks to attract world conscience to the problems associated with elevation in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.\nThe microcredit initiatives of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus have been described as inspiring a \"war on poverty that blends social conscience and business savvy\".\n\nThe Green party politician Bob Brown (who was arrested by the Tasmanian state police for a conscientious act of civil disobedience during the Franklin Dam protest) expresses \"world conscience\" in these terms: \"the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see Tobin tax) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market. Such an approach sees \"world conscience\" best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based globalisation or \"planetary democracy\" (for example internet voting for global governance organisations (see world government) based on the model of \"one person, one vote, one value\") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.\n\nThe American cardiologist Bernard Lown and the Russian cardiologist Yevgeniy Chazov were motivated in \"conscience\" through studying the catastrophic public health consequences of nuclear war in establishing International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 and continues to work to \"heal an ailing planet\".Worldwide expressions of \"conscience\" contributed to the decision of the French government to halt atmospheric nuclear tests at Mururoa in the Pacific in 1974 after 41 such explosions (although below-ground nuclear tests continued there into the 1990s).\n\nA challenge to \"world conscience\" was provided by an influential 1968 article by Garrett Hardin that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of \"conscience\"-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of \"conscience\" in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as sustainability and sustainable development of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under United Nations treaties (see common heritage of humanity). Areas designated common heritage of humanity under international law include the Moon, Outer Space, deep sea bed, Antarctica, the world cultural and natural heritage (see World Heritage Convention) and the human genome. It will be a significant challenge for \"world conscience\" that as world oil, coal, mineral, timber, agricultural and water reserves are depleted, there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit common heritage of mankind areas.\nThe philosopher Peter Singer has argued that the United Nations Millennium Development Goals represent the emergence of an ethics based not on national boundaries but on the idea of one world. Ninian Smart has similarly predicted that the increase in global travel and communication will gradually draw the world's religions towards a pluralistic and transcendental humanism characterized by an \"open spirit\" of empathy and compassion.\n\nNoam Chomsky has argued that forces opposing the development of such a world conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore has argued that mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should take into account that if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of \"conscience\" not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The \"Committee on Conscience\" of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: \"When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice\" (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: \"The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world.\" Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by \"conscience\", who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award \"for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use\". Avaaz is one of the largest global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus \"closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want\".\n\nIn a notable contemporary act of conscience, Christian bushwalker Brenda Hean protested against the flooding of Lake Pedder despite threats and that ultimately lead to her death. Another was the campaign by Ken Saro-Wiwa against oil extraction by multinational corporations in Nigeria that led to his execution. So too was the act by the Tank Man, or the Unknown Rebel photographed holding his shopping bag in the path of tanks during the protests at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on 5 June 1989. The actions of United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld to try and achieve peace in the Congo despite the (eventuating) threat to his life, were strongly motivated by conscience as is reflected in his diary, Vägmärken (\"Markings\"). Another example involved the actions of Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson, Jr to try and prevent the My Lai Massacre in the Vietnam War. Evan Pederick voluntarily confessed and was convicted of the Sydney Hilton bombing stating that his conscience could not tolerate the guilt and that \"I guess I was quite unique in the prison system in that I had to keep proving my guilt, whereas everyone else said they were innocent.\" Vasili Arkhipov was a Russian naval officer on out-of-radio-contact Soviet submarine B-59 being depth-charged by US warships during the Cuban Missile Crisis whose dissent when two other officers decided to launch a nuclear torpedo (unanimous agreement to launch was required) may have averted a nuclear war. In 1963 Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc performed a famous act of self-immolation to protest against alleged persecution of his faith by the Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem regime.\n\nConscience played a major role in the actions by anaesthetist Stephen Bolsin to whistleblow (see list of whistleblowers) on incompetent paediatric cardiac surgeons at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Jeffrey Wigand was motivated by conscience to expose the Big Tobacco scandal, revealing that executives of the companies knew that cigarettes were addictive and approved the addition of carcinogenic ingredients to the cigarettes. David Graham, a Food and Drug Administration employee, was motivated by conscience to whistleblow that the arthritis pain-reliever Vioxx increased the risk of cardiovascular deaths although the manufacturer suppressed this information. Rick Piltz from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, blew the whistle on a White House official who ignored majority scientific opinion to edit a climate change report (\"Our Changing Planet\") to reflect the Bush administration's view that the problem was unlikely to exist.\" Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist, was imprisoned and allegedly tortured for his act of conscience in throwing his shoes at George W. Bush. Mordechai Vanunu an Israeli former nuclear technician, acted on conscience to reveal details of Israel's nuclear weapons program to the British press in 1986; was kidnapped by Israeli agents, transported to Israel, convicted of treason and spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.\n\nAt the awards ceremony for the 200 metres at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City John Carlos, Tommie Smith and Peter Norman ignored death threats and official warnings to take part in an anti-racism protest that destroyed their respective careers. W. Mark Felt an agent of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation who retired in 1973 as the Bureau's Associate Director, acted on conscience to provide reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein with information that resulted in the Watergate scandal. Conscience was a major factor in US Public Health Service officer Peter Buxtun revealing the Tuskegee syphilis experiment to the public. The 2008 attack by the Israeli military on civilian areas of Palestinian Gaza was described as a \"stain on the world's conscience\". Conscience was a major factor in the refusal of Aung San Suu Kyi to leave Burma despite house arrest and persecution by the military dictatorship in that country.\n\"Conscience\" was a factor in Peter Galbraith's criticism of fraud in the 2009 Afghanistan election despite it costing him his United Nations job. Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Female Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the human rights of women and children in Iran. The human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, often referred to as the 'conscience of China' and who had previously been arrested and allegedly tortured by the Chinese regime for defending members of the Falun Gong, was abducted by Chinese security agents on 4 February 2009 and has not been seen since. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in his final statement before being sentenced by a closed Chinese court to over a decade in jail as a political prisoner of conscience stated: \"For hatred is corrosive of a person’s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation’s spirit.\" Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas. After being ordered to fire warning shots from her 50 calibre machinegun to make the boat turn back she saw it beginning to break up and sink with a father on board holding out his young daughter that she might be saved (see Children Overboard Affair). Whittle jumped without a life vest 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking \"this isn't right; this isn't how things should be.\" In February 2012 journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and killed by the Syrian Army in Homs during the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising and Siege of Homs, after she decided to stay at the \"epicentre of the storm\" in order to \"expose what is happening.\" In October 2012 the Taliban organised the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai a teenage girl who had been campaigning, despite their threats, for female education in Pakistan. In December 2012 the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was said to have stirred the collective conscience of India to civil disobedience and public protest at the lack of legal action against rapists in that country (see Rape in India) In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed details of a US National Security Agency internet and electronic communication PRISM (surveillance program) because of a conscience-felt obligation to the freedom of humanity greater than obedience to the laws that bound his employment.\n\nThe ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the Mahabharata of Vyasa, contains two pivotal moments of \"conscience\". The first occurs when the warrior Arjuna being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see Bhagavad-Gita) from Krishna about his spiritual duty (\"work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good\"). The second, at the end of the saga, is when king Yudhishthira having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws. The French author Montaigne (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of his essays (\"On experience\") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: \"Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly\". In his famous Japanese travel journal \"Oku no Hosomichi\" (\"Narrow Road to the Deep North\") composed of mixed haiku poetry and prose, Matsuo Bashō (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in \"conscience\"; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors. Chaucer's \"Franklin's Tale\" in \"The Canterbury Tales\" recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his \"conscience\" for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.\nBradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between \"traditional\" and \"critical\" conscience: \"The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him\". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 (\"They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none\") have been admired as a description of \"conscience\". So has John Donne's commencement of his poem \"\": \"Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;\"\n\nAnton Chekhov in his plays \"The Seagull\", \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"Three Sisters\" describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in \"The Fit\" describes it as a \"dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair ... in his breast, under the heart\" and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in \"From a Case Book\" calls it an \"unknown, mysterious power ... in fact close at hand and watching him.\" Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: \"Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion.\"\n\nE. H. Carr writes of Dostoevsky's character the young student Raskolnikov in the novel \"Crime and Punishment\" who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender on the principle of transcending conventional morals: \"the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken \"conscience\" (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man.\" Hermann Hesse wrote his \"Siddhartha\" to describe how a young man in the time of the Buddha follows his \"conscience\" on a journey to discover a transcendent inner space where all things could be unified and simply understood, ending up discovering that personal truth through selfless service as a ferryman. J. R. R. Tolkien in his epic \"The Lord of the Rings\" describes how only the hobbit Frodo is pure enough in \"conscience\" to carry the ring of power through war-torn Middle-earth to destruction in the Cracks of Doom, Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature Gollum. Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote that Albert Camus was the writer most representative of the Western consciousness and conscience in its relation to the non-Western world. Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird portrays Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck in the classic film from the book (see To Kill a Mockingbird (film))) as a lawyer true to his conscience who sets an example to his children and community.\n\nThe Robert Bolt play \"A Man For All Seasons\" focuses on the conscience of Catholic lawyer Thomas More in his struggle with King Henry VIII (\"the loyal subject is more bounden to be loyal to his conscience than to any other thing\"). George Orwell wrote his novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" on the isolated island of Jura, Scotland to describe how a man (Winston Smith) attempts to develop \"critical conscience\" in a totalitarian state which watches every action of the people and manipulates their thinking with a mixture of propaganda, endless war and thought control through language control (\"double think\" and \"newspeak\") to the point where prisoners look up to and even love their torturers. In the Ministry of Love, Winston's torturer (O'Brien) states: \"You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable\".\n\nA tapestry copy of Picasso's \"Guernica\" depicting a massacre of innocent women and children during the Spanish civil war is displayed on the wall of the United Nations building in New York City, at the entrance to the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted \"Man's Head\" to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.\nThe impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh wrote in a letter to his brother Theo in 1878 that \"one must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed. And he who chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and will hear the voice of his conscience address him every more clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone! ... That is what all great men have acknowledged in their works, all those who have thought a little more deeply and searched and worked and loved a little more than the rest, who have plumbed the depths of the sea of life.\"\n\nThe 1957 Ingmar Bergman film \"Seventh Seal\" portrays the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) returning disillusioned from the crusades (\"what is going to happen to those of us who want to believe, but aren't able to?\") across a plague-ridden landscape, undertaking a game of chess with the personification of Death until he can perform one meaningful altruistic act of conscience (overturning the chess board to distract Death long enough for a family of jugglers to escape in their wagon). The 1942 \"Casablanca\" centers on the development of conscience in the cynical American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) in the face of oppression by the Nazis and the example of the resistance leader Victor Laszlo.The David Lean and Robert Bolt screenplay for \"Doctor Zhivago\" (an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel) focuses strongly on the conscience of a doctor-poet in the midst of the Russian Revolution (in the end \"the walls of his heart were like paper\").The 1982 Ridley Scott film \"Blade Runner\" focuses on the struggles of conscience between and within a bounty hunter (Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford)) and a renegade replicant android (Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)) in a future society which refuses to accept that forms of artificial intelligence can have aspects of being such as conscience.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach wrote his last great choral composition the Mass in B minor (BWV 232) to express the alternating emotions of loneliness, despair, joy and rapture that arise as \"conscience\" reflects on a departed human life. Here JS Bach's use of counterpoint and contrapuntal settings, his dynamic discourse of melodically and rhythmically distinct voices seeking forgiveness of sins (\"Qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis\") evokes a spiraling moral conversation of all humanity expressing his belief that \"with devotional music, God is always present in his grace\".\n\nLudwig van Beethoven's meditations on illness, conscience and mortality in the Late String Quartets led to his dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see String Quartet No. 15) as a \"Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent\". John Lennon's work \"Imagine\" owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track \"The Inner Light\" sets to Indian raga music a verse from the \"Tao Te Ching\" that \"without going out of your door you can know the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie \"The Mission\" the guilty conscience and penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone (\"On Earth as it is in Heaven\") The song Sweet Lullaby by Deep Forest is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called \"Rorogwela\" in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother. The Dream Academy song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different kind of weather ... letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins.\"\n\nThe American Society of Journalists and Authors (ASJA) presents the Conscience-in-Media Award to journalists whom the society deems worthy of recognition for demonstrating \"singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice\".\n\nThe Ambassador of Conscience Award, Amnesty International's most prestigious human rights award, takes its inspiration from a poem written by Irish Nobel prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney called \"The Republic of Conscience.\"\nWinners of the award have included: Malala Yousafzai, singer and social justice activist Harry Belafonte, musician Peter Gabriel (2008), Nelson Mandela (2006), the Irish rock band U2 (2005), Mary Robinson and Hilda Morales Trujillo (a Guatemalan women's rights activist) (2004) and the author and public intellectual Václav Havel (2003).\n"}

The change would be regarded as objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period. \n\nThe phrase was coined by American scientist, Jared Diamond, in his 2005 book, . He had previously alluded to this theory while attempting to explain why in the course of long-term environmental degradation, Easter Island natives would, seemingly irrationally, chop down the last tree:\n\nIn his book, Diamond also refers to creeping normality as landscape amnesia. \n\nCreeping normality has been used to explain a number of different phenomenon, including the ones listed below: \n\nThe term has also been used several times in conjunction with the increase of maternity patients who present as obese and overweight. In their research article, authors Wilkinson, Poad, and Stapleton suggest that as the number of clinically obese or overweight pregnant women increase, the negative stigmatization with being so decreases. Schmeid, et al, states that as doctors see more women of an unhealthy weight, they are less likely to advise healthy weight gain goals during pregnancy, out of fear of fat-shaming. Because the shift in society to accept women of all body types has been so slow, physicians may not be aware that they are not addressing the gestational weight gain as soon as necessary. An anonymous survey was conducted from January to April, 2010, of obstetrics and gynecology residents. Of those surveyed, only \"7.6 percent selected correct BMI ranges for each category, and only 5.8 percent selected correct gestational weight gain ranges\". \n\nAntheaume and Barbelivien described the creeping normality that destroys businesses, causing them to not see the subtle, negative shifts in the community around them. The authors state that owners of family businesses are more likely to notice the small changes than a large corporation, however \"detecting a problem is no guarantee of the ability to solve it\". \n\nIn his thesis, Chon states that the increase in cybercrime fits the pattern for creeping normality. The number of websites involved in \"hacking and cybercrime activities\" has increased at a slow and steady pace, mostly below society's awareness. \n\nPeter Ho referred to creeping normality in his four-part IPS-Nathan lecture series in spring of 2017. In regards to several issues that Singapore is facing, he claimed that \"things get just a little bit worse each year than the year before, but not bad enough for anyone to notice\". One example is through climate change, where he stated that the country did not realize an increase of flooding was caused by rising temperatures, and not poor drainage as first suspected. \n\nThere are a number of metaphors related to creeping normality, including:\n"}

It is an area graph that depicts the quantity of work in a given state, showing arrivals, time in queue, quantity in queue, and departure.\n\nCumulative flow diagrams are seen in the literature of agile software development and lean product development. They are also seen in transportation. \n\nSome people consider a cumulative flow diagram to be a more sophisticated version of a \"burn up chart\", which is the opposite of a burn down chart. A burn down chart tracks work remaining over time while burn up charts like the CFD track the growth (or shrinkage) of work in certain states over time. With its focus on tracking changes in queue size per state, the CFD has a stronger focus on identifying and rooting out the causes of dramatic changes in throughput. \n\nAnother term is \"cumulative input-output diagram\". The term \"Newell curve\" is also used, in reference to Gordon F. Newell. It is not known if Newell originated the curve.\n"}
{"id": "40240263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40240263", "title": "Discrete time and continuous time", "text": "Discrete time and continuous time\n\nIn mathematics and in particular mathematical dynamics, discrete time and continuous time are two alternative frameworks within which to model variables that evolve over time.\n\nDiscrete time views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate \"points in time\", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time (\"time period\")—that is, time is viewed as a discrete variable. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. In this framework, each variable of interest is measured once at each time period. The number of measurements between any two time periods is finite. Measurements are typically made at sequential integer values of the variable \"time\".\n\nA discrete signal or discrete-time signal is a time series consisting of a sequence of quantities.\n\nUnlike a continuous-time signal, a discrete-time signal is not a function of a continuous argument; however, it may have been obtained by sampling from a continuous-time signal. When a discrete-time signal is obtained by sampling a sequence at uniformly spaced times, it has an associated sampling rate.\n\nDiscrete-time signals may have several origins, but can usually be classified into one of two groups:\n\n\nIn contrast, continuous time views variables as having a particular value for potentially only an infinitesimally short amount of time. Between any two points in time there are an infinite number of other points in time. The variable \"time\" ranges over the entire real number line, or depending on the context, over some subset of it such as the non-negative reals. Thus time is viewed as a continuous variable.\n\nA continuous signal or a continuous-time signal is a varying quantity (a signal) \nwhose domain, which is often time, is a continuum (e.g., a connected interval of the reals). That is, the function's domain is an uncountable set. The function itself need not be continuous. To contrast, a discrete time signal has a countable domain, like the natural numbers.\n\nA signal of continuous amplitude and time is known as a continuous-time signal or an analog signal. This (a signal) will have some value at every instant of time. The electrical signals derived in proportion with the physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, sound etc. are generally continuous signals. Other examples of continuous signals are sine wave, cosine wave, triangular wave etc. \n\nThe signal is defined over a domain, which may or may not be finite, and there is a functional mapping from the domain to the value of the signal. The continuity of the time variable, in connection with the law of density of real numbers, means that the signal value can be found at any arbitrary point in time.\n\nA typical example of an infinite duration signal is:\n\nformula_1\n\nA finite duration counterpart of the above signal could be:\n\nformula_2 and formula_3 otherwise.\n\nThe value of a finite (or infinite) duration signal may or may not be finite. For example,\n\nformula_4 and formula_3 otherwise,\n\nis a finite duration signal but it takes an infinite value for formula_6. \n\nIn many disciplines, the convention is that a continuous signal must always have a finite value, which makes more sense in the case of physical signals.\n\nFor some purposes, infinite singularities are acceptable as long as the signal is integrable over any finite interval (for example, the formula_7 signal is not integrable at infinity, but formula_8 is).\n\nAny analog signal is continuous by nature. Discrete-time signals, used in digital signal processing, can be obtained by sampling and quantization of continuous signals.\n\nContinuous signal may also be defined over an independent variable other than time. Another very common independent variable is space and is particularly useful in image processing, where two space dimensions are used.\n\nDiscrete time is often employed when empirical measurements are involved, because normally it is only possible to measure variables sequentially. For example, while economic activity actually occurs continuously, there being no moment when the economy is totally in a pause, it is only possible to measure economic activity discretely. For this reason, published data on, for example, gross domestic product will show a sequence of quarterly values.\n\nWhen one attempts to empirically explain such variables in terms of other variables and/or their own prior values, one uses time series or regression methods in which variables are indexed with a subscript indicating the time period in which the observation occurred. For example, \"y\" might refer to the value of income observed in unspecified time period \"t\", \"y\" to the value of income observed in the third time period, etc.\n\nMoreover, when a researcher attempts to develop a theory to explain what is observed in discrete time, often the theory itself is expressed in discrete time in order to facilitate the development of a time series or regression model.\n\nOn the other hand, it is often more mathematically tractable to construct theoretical models in continuous time, and often in areas such as physics an exact description requires the use of continuous time. In a continuous time context, the value of a variable \"y\" at an unspecified point in time is denoted as \"y\"(\"t\") or, when the meaning is clear, simply as \"y\".\n\nDiscrete time makes use of difference equations, also known as recurrence relations. An example, known as the logistic map or logistic equation, is\n\nin which \"r\" is a parameter in the range from 2 to 4 inclusive, and \"x\" is a variable in the range from 0 to 1 inclusive whose value in period \"t\" nonlinearly affects its value in the next period, \"t\"+1. For example, if formula_10 and formula_11, then for \"t\"=1 we have formula_12, and for \"t\"=2 we have formula_13.\n\nAnother example models the adjustment of a price \"P\" in response to non-zero excess demand for a product as\n\nwhere formula_15 is the positive speed-of-adjustment parameter which is less than or equal to 1, and where formula_16 is the excess demand function.\n\nContinuous time makes use of differential equations. For example, the adjustment of a price \"P\" in response to non-zero excess demand for a product can be modeled in continuous time as\n\nwhere the left side is the first derivative of the price with respect to time (that is, the rate of change of the price), formula_18 is the speed-of-adjustment parameter which can be any positive finite number, and formula_16 is again the excess demand function.\n\nA variable measured in discrete time can be plotted as a step function, in which each time period is given a region on the horizontal axis of the same length as every other time period, and the measured variable is plotted as a height that stays constant throughout the region of the time period. In this graphical technique, the graph appears as a sequence of horizontal steps. Alternatively, each time period can be viewed as a detached point in time, usually at an integer value on the horizontal axis, and the measured variable is plotted as a height above that time-axis point. In this technique, the graph appears as a set of dots.\n\nThe values of a variable measured in continuous time are plotted as a continuous function, since the domain of time is considered to be the entire real axis or at least some connected portion of it.\n\n"}
{"id": "34984967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34984967", "title": "Donor intent", "text": "Donor intent\n\nIn philanthropy, donor intent is the purpose, sometimes publicly expressed, for which a philanthropist intends a charitable gift or bequest. Donor intent is most often expressed in gift restrictions, terms, or agreements between a donor and donee, but it may also be expressed separately in the words, actions, beliefs, and giving practices of a philanthropist. Donor intent is protected in American law regarding charitable trusts, and trustees' primary fiduciary obligation is to carry out a donor's wishes.\n\nFidelity to donor intent is sometimes distinguished from grant compliance, and \"donor intent\" refers to the actions of a grantmaking entity and grant compliance refers to the actions of a grant recipient, but the term donor intent is commonly used to refer to both the guiding principles of a grantmaking entity and the purposes of a specific gift.\n\nThere have been many controversies, including litigation, over donor intent at private foundations, universities, and arts organizations.\n\nDonor intent has been defended as a moral obligation between giver and recipient. Defenders of donor intent argue that on a basic ethical level, trustees and gift recipients must do what they have agreed with the original donor to do, explicitly or implicitly: \"When donor intent is violated, and particularly when it is egregiously violated, it undermines the bedrock trust on which all charitable giving rests.\"\n\nDonor intent is thus also defended as necessary to ensure future charitable giving. Future donors might not be inclined to leave money to charitable causes if they see that trustees, grant recipients, or policymakers do not respect the stated intent. Peter Frumkin has written that \"as s a policy tool for encouraging future giving, protection of a donor's intent is needed to give future philanthropists the confidence they need to pass their wealth on to others to administer.\" Carl Schramm, former president of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, has said on donor intent, \"If we dont recognize it, we discourage wealthy people from creating foundations in the future.\"\n\nSurvey data of Americans indicates that donor intent and grant compliance are valued by the public. When asked by Zogby if they would stop giving money to a charity that ignored a request to use a previous donation for a specific purpose, 53% said they would \"definitely stop giving\" and an additional 25.7% would \"probably stop giving.\" When pollsters asked, \"How important do you think showing respect for a donor's wishes is to the ethical governance of nonprofit charitable organizations?,\" 82.9% considered it \"very important,\" 14.6% \"somewhat important.\"\n\nFinally, respect for donor intent is defended as necessary to preserve pluralism in civil society: \"Those who take the idea of donor intent seriously believe that only by protecting the idiosyncratic and at times outlandish ideas of donors will it be possible for philanthropy to innovate and pursue ideas that are either ahead of or behind their time,\" Frumkin has said.\n\nMany arguments against donor intent are made against honoring it in perpetuity. Such arguments date back at least to the 18th century and French economist Jacques Turgot: \"No work of man is made for immortality; and since foundations, always multiplied by vanity, would in the long run, if uninterfered with, absorb all funds and private properties, it would be absolutely necessary at last to destroy them.\"\n\nWhile not arguing against donor intent \"per se\", Julius Rosenwald criticized philanthropic funds that are established in perpetuity, arguing that narrowly defined statements of donor intent can be superseded as situations change: \" I have heard of a fund which provides a baked potato at each meal for each young woman at Bryn Mawr, and of another, dating from one of the great families, which pays for half a loaf of bread deposited each day at the door of each student in one of the colleges of Oxford... The list of these precisely focused gifts which have lost their usefulness could be extended into volumes.\"\n\nAnother argument against donor intent relates to whether limitations may be placed on donors' purposes, either prudential or legal. In \"Evans v. Abney\", the Supreme Court held that Augustus Octavius Bacon's clearly defined gift of a park to Macon, Georgia, for whites only was illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and so the gift reverted to Bacon’s heirs. In cases that donor intent can be modified, courts have latitude to do that under \"cy pres\" doctrine. Finally, some critics of donor intent argue that it cements economic inequality.\n\nDonor intent is considered virtually impossible to be maintained in perpetuity because of changing situations, erosion of capital, and the distance of successor trustees from a donor. In some instances, however, donor intent has been lost only a short time after a donor's death. Waldemar Nielsen has argued that the Carnegie Corporation of New York swiftly lost the \"democratic, hopeful, and constructive\" spirit of Andrew Carnegie's giving: \"That within five years of his death his Corporation should have turned into a racist and reactionary machine to defend the privileges of the old WASP elite and block the advancement of immigrants and the underprivileged deformed his spirit and intent.\" In the early 2000s, the Daniels Fund, established by Bill Daniels, drifted away from what Daniels' trustees considered to be his principles, and the drift was arrested by board action. \nSome donors have adopted strategies to prevent philanthropies that they create from drifting from donor intent.\n\nRosenwald cautioned donors against perpetuity: \"I am opposed to gifts in perpetuity for any purpose.\" Some donors have attempted to preserve their intent either by \"giving while living\" or by establishing a date or timeframe in the future by which a foundation must disburse its assets, or \"sunset.\" Chuck Feeney founded the Atlantic Philanthropies, which is scheduled to spend down its assets by 2017. In 1975, inspired by the controversy over donor intent at the Ford Foundation, John M. Olin adopted plans for the John M. Olin Foundation to disburse its assets by 2005. Olin believed that capitalism was the basis of prosperity and sought to promote conservative political and legal thinking. The spend-down plan gave the Olin Foundation the spending profile of a foundation with three times as many assets, Jeffrey Cain has written: \"The Olin Foundation made a deliberate decision to have a profound impact on its time, rather than a lighter one that spanned years into the future.\"\n\nCarnegie left the Carnegie Corporation's mission vague and open-ended by instructing his successors to \"promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding\" but also granting \"full authority to change policies or causes hitherto aided, from time to time, when this, in their opinion, has become necessary or desirable. They shall best conform to my wishes by using their own judgment.\" In creating the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, John D. MacArthur reportedly told his lawyer, \"I'll make [the money]. But you people, after I'm dead, will have to learn how to spend it.\"\n\nOther donors are much narrower. James B. Duke specified percentages of the annual payout that would go to various categories of giving by the Duke Endowment, including even a formula for reimbursing charity hospitals. Today, some donors leave detailed documents to supplement official mission statements, including reflections on their principles, video statements, and records of their personal giving.\n\nOften, donors select family members, personal business associates, lawyers, or nonprofit leaders to serve on their boards. The Daniels Fund requires trustees to sign a statement affirming that they understand Bill Daniels' donor intent and will honor it in their decision-making on behalf of the foundation. The foundation that was created by Lloyd Noble recruits apprentice trustees to shadow the actual board; some are elected to the board in the future. At meetings of the Duke Endowment's board, James B. Duke's original indenture of trust is read aloud to reinforce his intentions. The John Templeton Foundation has a provision for periodic \"donor intent audits\" to ensure its officers uphold John Templeton's purposes.\n\n\n"}

It is applied to identify non-influential inputs for a computationally costly mathematical model or for a model with a large number of inputs, where the costs of estimating other sensitivity analysis measures such as the variance-based measures is not affordable. Like all screening, the EE method provides qualitative sensitivity analysis measures, i.e. measures which allow the identification of non-influential inputs or which allow to rank the input factors in order of importance, but do not quantify exactly the relative importance of the inputs.\n\nTo exemplify the EE method, let us assume to consider a mathematical model with formula_1 input factors. Let formula_2 be the output of interest (a scalar for simplicity):\n\nThe original EE method of Morris provides two sensitivity measures for each input factor:\n\n\nThese two measures are obtained through a design based on the construction of a series of trajectories in the space of the inputs, where inputs are randomly moved One-At-a-Time (OAT).\nIn this design, each model input is assumed to vary across formula_6 selected levels in the space of the input factors. The region of experimentation formula_7 is thus a formula_8-dimensional formula_6-level grid.\n\nEach trajectory is composed of formula_10 points since input factors move one by one of a step formula_11 in formula_12 while all the others remain fixed.\n\nAlong each trajectory the so-called \"elementary effect\" for each input factor is defined as:\n\nwhere formula_14 is any selected value in formula_15 such that the transformed point is still in formula_15 for each index formula_17\n\nformula_18 elementary effects are estimated for each input formula_19 by randomly sampling formula_18 points formula_21. \n\nUsually formula_18 ~ 4-10, depending on the number of input factors, on the computational cost of the model and on the choice of the number of levels formula_23, since a high number of levels to be explored needs to be balanced by a high number of trajectories, in order to obtain an exploratory sample. It is demonstrated that a convenient choice for the parameters formula_23 and formula_11 is formula_23 even and formula_11 equal to formula_28, as this ensures equal probability of sampling in the input space.\n\nIn case input factors are not uniformly distributed, the best practice is to sample in the space of the quantiles and to obtain the inputs values using inverse cumulative distribution functions. Note that in this case formula_11 equals the step taken by the inputs in the space of the quantiles.\n\nThe two measures formula_4 and formula_5 are defined as the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of each input:\n\nThese two measures need to be read together (e.g. on a two-dimensional graph) in order to rank input factors in order of importance and identify those inputs which do not influence the output variability. Low values of both formula_4 and formula_5 correspond to a non-influent input.\n\nAn improvement of this method was developed by Campolongo et al. who proposed a revised measure formula_36, which on its own is sufficient to provide a reliable ranking of the input factors. The revised measure is the mean of the distribution of the absolute values of the elementary effects of the input factors:\nThe use of formula_36 solves the problem of the effects of opposite signs which occurs when the model is non-monotonic and which can cancel each other out, thus resulting in a low value for formula_4.\n\nAn efficient technical scheme to construct the trajectories used in the EE method is presented in the original paper by Morris while an improvement strategy aimed at better exploring the input space is proposed by Campolongo et al..\n"}

Specifically, a four-vector is an element of a four-dimensional vector space considered as a representation space of the standard representation of the Lorentz group, the (½,½) representation. It differs from a Euclidean vector in how its magnitude is determined. The transformations that preserve this magnitude are the Lorentz transformations, which include spatial rotations and boosts (a change by a constant velocity to another inertial reference frame).\n\nFour-vectors describe, for instance, position in spacetime modeled as Minkowski space, a particle's four-momentum , the amplitude of the electromagnetic four-potential at a point in spacetime, and the elements of the subspace spanned by the gamma matrices inside the Dirac algebra.\n\nThe Lorentz group may be represented by 4×4 matrices . The action of a Lorentz transformation on a general contravariant four-vector (like the examples above), regarded as a column vector with Cartesian coordinates with respect to an inertial frame in the entries, is given by\n\n(matrix multiplication) where the components of the primed object refer to the new frame. Related to the examples above that are given as contravariant vectors, there are also the corresponding covariant vectors , and . These transform according to the rule\n\nwhere denotes the matrix transpose. This rule is different from the above rule. It corresponds to the dual representation of the standard representation. However, for the Lorentz group the dual of any representation is equivalent to the original representation. Thus the objects with covariant indices are four-vectors as well.\n\nFor an example of a well-behaved four-component object in special relativity that is \"not\" a four-vector, see bispinor. It is similarly defined, the difference being that the transformation rule under Lorentz transformations is given by a representation other than the standard representation. In this case, the rule reads , where is a 4×4 matrix other than . Similar remarks apply to objects with fewer or more components that are well-behaved under Lorentz transformations. These include scalars, spinors, tensors and spinor-tensors.\n\nThe article considers four-vectors in the context of special relativity. Although the concept of four-vectors also extends to general relativity, some of the results stated in this article require modification in general relativity. \n\nThe notations in this article are: lowercase bold for three-dimensional vectors, hats for three-dimensional unit vectors, capital bold for four dimensional vectors (except for the four-gradient), and tensor index notation.\n\nA four-vector \"A\" is a vector with a \"timelike\" component and three \"spacelike\" components, and can be written in various equivalent notations:\n\nwhere in the last form the magnitude component and basis vector have been combined to a single element.\n\nThe upper indices indicate contravariant components. Here the standard convention is that Latin indices take values for spatial components, so that \"i\" = 1, 2, 3, and Greek indices take values for space \"and time\" components, so \"α\" = 0, 1, 2, 3, used with the summation convention. The split between the time component and the spatial components is a useful one to make when determining contractions of one four vector with other tensor quantities, such as for calculating Lorentz invariants in inner products (examples are given below), or raising and lowering indices.\n\nIn special relativity, the spacelike basis E, E, E and components \"A\", \"A\", \"A\" are often Cartesian basis and components:\n\nalthough, of course, any other basis and components may be used, such as spherical polar coordinates\n\nor cylindrical polar coordinates,\n\nor any other orthogonal coordinates, or even general curvilinear coordinates. Note the coordinate labels are always subscripted as labels and are not indices taking numerical values. In general relativity, local curvilinear coordinates in a local basis must be used. Geometrically, a four-vector can still be interpreted as an arrow, but in spacetime - not just space. In relativity, the arrows are drawn as part of Minkowski diagram (also called \"spacetime diagram\"). In this article, four-vectors will be referred to simply as vectors.\n\nIt is also customary to represent the bases by column vectors:\n\nso that:\n\nThe relation between the covariant and contravariant coordinates is through the Minkowski metric tensor (referred to as the metric), \"η\" which raises and lowers indices as follows:\n\nand in various equivalent notations the covariant components are:\n\nwhere the lowered index indicates it to be covariant. Often the metric is diagonal, as is the case for orthogonal coordinates (see line element), but not in general curvilinear coordinates.\n\nThe bases can be represented by row vectors:\n\nso that:\n\nThe motivation for the above conventions are that the inner product is a scalar, see below for details.\n\nGiven two inertial or rotated frames of reference, a four-vector is defined as a quantity which transforms according to the Lorentz transformation matrix Λ:\n\nIn index notation, the contravariant and covariant components transform according to, respectively:\n\nin which the matrix Λ has components Λ\"\" in row \"μ\" and column \"ν\", and the inverse matrix Λ has components Λ\"\" in row \"μ\" and column \"ν\".\n\nFor background on the nature of this transformation definition, see tensor. All four-vectors transform in the same way, and this can be generalized to four-dimensional relativistic tensors; see special relativity.\n\nFor two frames rotated by a fixed angle \"θ\" about an axis defined by the unit vector:\n\nwithout any boosts, the matrix Λ has components given by:\n\nwhere \"δ\" is the Kronecker delta, and \"ε\" is the three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol. The spacelike components of four-vectors are rotated, while the timelike components remain unchanged.\n\nFor the case of rotations about the \"z\"-axis only, the spacelike part of the Lorentz matrix reduces to the rotation matrix about the \"z\"-axis:\n\nFor two frames moving at constant relative three-velocity v (not four-velocity, see below), it is convenient to denote and define the relative velocity in units of \"c\" by:\n\nThen without rotations, the matrix Λ has components given by:\n\nwhere the Lorentz factor is defined by:\n\nand \"δ\" is the Kronecker delta. Contrary to the case for pure rotations, the spacelike and timelike components are mixed together under boosts.\n\nFor the case of a boost in the \"x\"-direction only, the matrix reduces to;\n\nWhere the rapidity \"ϕ\" expression has been used, written in terms of the hyperbolic functions:\n\nThis Lorentz matrix illustrates the boost to be a \"hyperbolic rotation\" in four dimensional spacetime, analogous to the circular rotation above in three-dimensional space.\n\nFour-vectors have the same linearity properties as Euclidean vectors in three dimensions. They can be added in the usual entrywise way:\n\nand similarly scalar multiplication by a scalar \"λ\" is defined entrywise by:\n\nThen subtraction is the inverse operation of addition, defined entrywise by:\n\nApplying the Minkowski tensor \"η\" to two four-vectors A and B, writing the result in dot product notation, we have, using Einstein notation:\n\nIt is convenient to rewrite the definition in matrix form:\n\nin which case \"η\" above is the entry in row \"μ\" and column \"ν\" of the Minkowski metric as a square matrix. The Minkowski metric is not a Euclidean metric, because it is indefinite (see metric signature). A number of other expressions can be used because the metric tensor can raise and lower the components of A or B. For contra/co-variant components of A and co/contra-variant components of B, we have:\n\nso in the matrix notation:\n\nwhile for A and B each in covariant components:\n\nwith a similar matrix expression to the above.\n\nApplying the Minkowski tensor to a four-vector A with itself we get:\n\nwhich, depending on the case, may be considered the square, or its negative, of the length of the vector.\n\nFollowing are two common choices for the metric tensor in the standard basis (essentially Cartesian coordinates). If orthogonal coordinates are used, there would be scale factors along the diagonal part of the spacelike part of the metric, while for general curvilinear coordinates the entire spacelike part of the metric would have components dependent on the curvilinear basis used.\n\nIn the (+−−−) metric signature, evaluating the summation over indices gives:\n\nwhile in matrix form:\n\nIt is a recurring theme in special relativity to take the expression\n\nin one reference frame, where \"C\" is the value of the inner product in this frame, and:\n\nin another frame, in which \"C\"′ is the value of the inner product in this frame. Then since the inner product is an invariant, these must be equal:\n\nthat is:\n\nConsidering that physical quantities in relativity are four-vectors, this equation has the appearance of a \"conservation law\", but there is no \"conservation\" involved. The primary significance of the Minkowski inner product is that for any two four-vectors, its value is invariant for all observers; a change of coordinates does not result in a change in value of the inner product. The components of the four-vectors change from one frame to another; A and A′ are connected by a Lorentz transformation, and similarly for B and B′, although the inner products are the same in all frames. Nevertheless, this type of expression is exploited in relativistic calculations on a par with conservation laws, since the magnitudes of components can be determined without explicitly performing any Lorentz transformations. A particular example is with energy and momentum in the energy-momentum relation derived from the four-momentum vector (see also below).\n\nIn this signature we have:\n\nWith the signature (+−−−), four-vectors may be classified as either spacelike if formula_41, timelike if formula_42, and null vectors if formula_43.\n\nSome authors define \"η\" with the opposite sign, in which case we have the (−+++) metric signature. Evaluating the summation with this signature:\n\nwhile the matrix form is:\n\nNote that in this case, in one frame:\n\nwhile in another:\n\nso that:\n\nwhich is equivalent to the above expression for \"C\" in terms of A and B. Either convention will work. With the Minkowski metric defined in the two ways above, the only difference between covariant and contravariant four-vector components are signs, therefore the signs depend on which sign convention is used.\n\nWe have:\n\nWith the signature (−+++), four-vectors may be classified as either spacelike if formula_42, timelike if formula_41, and null if formula_43.\n\nApplying the Minkowski tensor is often expressed as the effect of the dual vector of one vector on the other:\n\nHere the \"A\"s are the components of the dual vector A* of A in the dual basis and called the covariant coordinates of A, while the original \"A\" components are called the contravariant coordinates.\n\nIn special relativity (but not general relativity), the derivative of a four-vector with respect to a scalar \"λ\" (invariant) is itself a four-vector. It is also useful to take the differential of the four-vector, \"d\"A and divide it by the differential of the scalar, \"dλ\":\n\nwhere the contravariant components are:\n\nwhile the covariant components are:\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, one often takes the differential of a four-vector and divides by the differential in proper time (see below).\n\nA point in Minkowski space is a time and spatial position, called an \"event\", or sometimes the position four-vector or four-position or 4-position, described in some reference frame by a set of four coordinates:\n\nwhere r is the three-dimensional space position vector. If r is a function of coordinate time \"t\" in the same frame, i.e. r = r(\"t\"), this corresponds to a sequence of events as \"t\" varies. The definition \"R\" = \"ct\" ensures that all the coordinates have the same units (of distance). These coordinates are the components of the \"position four-vector\" for the event.\nThe \"displacement four-vector\" is defined to be an \"arrow\" linking two events:\n\nFor the differential four-position on a world line we have, using a norm notation:\n\ndefining the differential line element d\"s\" and differential proper time increment d\"τ\", but this \"norm\" is also:\n\nso that:\n\nWhen considering physical phenomena, differential equations arise naturally; however, when considering space and time derivatives of functions, it is unclear which reference frame these derivatives are taken with respect to. It is agreed that time derivatives are taken with respect to the proper time formula_62. As proper time is an invariant, this guarantees that the proper-time-derivative of any four-vector is itself a four-vector. It is then important to find a relation between this proper-time-derivative and another time derivative (using the coordinate time \"t\" of an inertial reference frame). This relation is provided by taking the above differential invariant spacetime interval, then dividing by (\"cdt\") to obtain:\n\nwhere u = \"d\"r/\"dt\" is the coordinate 3-velocity of an object measured in the same frame as the coordinates \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", and coordinate time \"t\", and\n\nis the Lorentz factor. This provides a useful relation between the differentials in coordinate time and proper time:\n\nThis relation can also be found from the time transformation in the Lorentz transformations.\n\nImportant four-vectors in relativity theory can be defined by applying this differential formula_66.\n\nConsidering that partial derivatives are linear operators, one can form a four-gradient from the partial time derivative /\"t\" and the spatial gradient ∇. Using the standard basis, in index and abbreviated notations, the contravariant components are:\n\nNote the basis vectors are placed in front of the components, to prevent confusion between taking the derivative of the basis vector, or simply indicating the partial derivative is a component of this four-vector. The covariant components are:\n\nSince this is an operator, it doesn't have a \"length\", but evaluating the inner product of the operator with itself gives another operator:\n\nGeometrically, U is a normalized vector tangent to the world line of the particle. Using the differential of the four-position, the magnitude of the four-velocity can be obtained:\n\nin short, the magnitude of the four-velocity for any object is always a fixed constant:\n\nThe norm is also:\n\nso that:\n\nwhich reduces to the definition of the Lorentz factor.\n\nThe four-acceleration is given by:\n\nwhere a = \"d\"u/\"dt\" is the coordinate 3-acceleration. Since the magnitude of U is a constant, the four acceleration is orthogonal to the four velocity, i.e. the Minkowski inner product of the four-acceleration and the four-velocity is zero:\n\nwhich is true for all world lines. The geometric meaning of four-acceleration is the curvature vector of the world line in Minkowski space.\n\nFor a massive particle of rest mass (or invariant mass) \"m\", the four-momentum is given by:\n\nwhere the total energy of the moving particle is:\n\nand the total relativistic momentum is:\n\nTaking the inner product of the four-momentum with itself:\n\nand also:\n\nwhich leads to the energy–momentum relation:\n\nThis last relation is useful relativistic mechanics, essential in relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory, all with applications to particle physics.\n\nThe four-force acting on a particle is defined analogously to the 3-force as the time derivative of 3-momentum in Newton's second law:\n\nwhere \"P\" is the power transferred to move the particle, and f is the 3-force acting on the particle. For a particle of constant invariant mass \"m\", this is equivalent to\n\nAn invariant derived from the four-force is:\n\nfrom the above result.\n\nThe four-heat flux vector field, is essentially similar to the 3d heat flux vector field q, in the local frame of the fluid:\n\nwhere \"T\" is absolute temperature and \"k\" is thermal conductivity.\n\nThe flux of baryons is:\n\nwhere \"n\" is the number density of baryons in the local rest frame of the baryon fluid (positive values for baryons, negative for antibaryons), and U the four-velocity field (of the fluid) as above.\n\nThe four-entropy vector is defined by:\n\nwhere \"s\" is the entropy per baryon, and \"T\" the absolute temperature, in the local rest frame of the fluid.\n\nExamples of four-vectors in electromagnetism include the following.\n\nThe electromagnetic four-current (or more correctly a four-current density) is defined by\n\nformed from the current density j and charge density \"ρ\".\n\nThe electromagnetic four-potential (or more correctly a four-EM vector potential) defined by\n\nformed from the vector potential a and the scalar potential \"ϕ\".\n\nThe four-potential is not uniquely determined, because it depends on a choice of gauge.\n\nIn the wave equation for the electromagnetic field:\n\nA photonic plane wave can be described by the four-frequency defined as\n\nwhere \"ν\" is the frequency of the wave and formula_94 is a unit vector in the travel direction of the wave. Now:\n\nso the four-frequency of a photon is always a null vector.\n\nThe quantities reciprocal to time \"t\" and space r are the angular frequency \"ω\" and wave vector k, respectively. They form the components of the four-wavevector or wave four-vector:\n\nA wave packet of nearly monochromatic light can be described by:\n\nThe de Broglie relations then showed that four-wavevector applied to matter waves as well as to light waves. :\n\nyielding formula_99 and formula_100, where \"ħ\" is the Planck constant divided by 2\"π\".\n\nThe square of the norm is:\n\nand by the de Broglie relation:\n\nwe have the matter wave analogue of the energy–momentum relation:\n\nNote that for massless particles, in which case , we have:\n\nor ||k|| = \"ω\"/\"c\". Note this is consistent with the above case; for photons with a 3-wavevector of modulus \"ω\"/\"c\", in the direction of wave propagation defined by the unit vector formula_94.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the four-probability current or probability four-current is analogous to the electromagnetic four-current:\n\nwhere \"ρ\" is the probability density function corresponding to the time component, and j is the probability current vector. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, this current is always well defined because the expressions for density and current are positive definite and can admit a probability interpretation. In relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is not always possible to find a current, particularly when interactions are involved.\n\nReplacing the energy by the energy operator and the momentum by the momentum operator in the four-momentum, one obtains the four-momentum operator, used in relativistic wave equations.\n\nThe four-spin of a particle is defined in the rest frame of a particle to be\n\nwhere s is the spin pseudovector. In quantum mechanics, not all three components of this vector are simultaneously measurable, only one component is. The timelike component is zero in the particle's rest frame, but not in any other frame. This component can be found from an appropriate Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe norm squared is the (negative of the) magnitude squared of the spin, and according to quantum mechanics we have\n\nThis value is observable and quantized, with \"s\" the spin quantum number (not the magnitude of the spin vector).\n\nA four-vector \"A\" can also be defined in using the Pauli matrices as a basis, again in various equivalent notations:\n\nor explicitly:\n\nand in this formulation, the four-vector is represented as a Hermitian matrix (the matrix transpose and complex conjugate of the matrix leaves it unchanged), rather than a real-valued column or row vector. The determinant of the matrix is the modulus of the four-vector, so the determinant is an invariant:\n\nThis idea of using the Pauli matrices as basis vectors is employed in the algebra of physical space, an example of a Clifford algebra.\n\nIn spacetime algebra, another example of Clifford algebra, the gamma matrices can also form a basis. (They are also called the Dirac matrices, owing to their appearance in the Dirac equation). There is more than one way to express the gamma matrices, detailed in that main article.\n\nThe Feynman slash notation is a shorthand for a four-vector A contracted with the gamma matrices:\n\nThe four-momentum contracted with the gamma matrices is an important case in relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In the Dirac equation and other relativistic wave equations, terms of the form:\n\nappear, in which the energy \"E\" and momentum components are replaced by their respective operators.\n\n\n"}

The series was based on the goals known as the Four Freedoms enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in his State of the Union Address delivered on January 6, 1941. Rockwell considered this painting and \"Freedom of Speech\" the most successful of the series. \"Freedom of Worship\" was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of \"The Saturday Evening Post\" alongside an essay by philosopher Will Durant.\n\n\"Freedom of Worship\" is the second of a series of four oil paintings by Norman Rockwell entitled \"Four Freedoms\". The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941, known as Four Freedoms. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution are freedom of speech and freedom of religion. The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the Allies' World War II policy statement, the Atlantic Charter, and became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in \"The Saturday Evening Post\", accompanied by essays from noted writers: \"Freedom of Speech\" (February 20), \"Freedom of Worship\" (February 27), \"Freedom from Want\" (March 6) and \"Freedom from Fear\" (March 13). For the essay accompanying \"Freedom of Worship\", \"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume \"The Story of Civilization\", coauthored with his wife, Ariel Durant. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.\n\nThe painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with his head covered carrying a religious book who is Jewish, an older woman who is Protestant, and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding rosary beads who is Catholic. In 1966, Rockwell used \"Freedom of Worship\" to show his admiration for John F. Kennedy in a \"Look\" story illustration entitled \"JFK's Bold Legacy\". The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to \"Freedom of Worship\" along with Peace Corps volunteers.\n\nThe original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a oil on canvas depicting tolerance as \"the basis for a democracy's religious diversity\". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.\n\nIn June 1942, \"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works. By October, the \"Post\" was worried about Rockwell's progress on the \"Four Freedoms\" and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on \"Freedom of Worship\", his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that was inspired by the phrase \"Each according to the dictates of his own conscience.\" His Arlington, Vermont, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the Episcopal Church. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with \"The Post\" who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by \"'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his fez, was too obviously foreign to offend.\" The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.\n\nRockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to \"Freedom of Worship\", \"I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over.\" Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion \"is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings.\"\n\n\"Post\" editor Ben Hibbs said of \"Speech\" and \"Worship\", \"To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The \"Four Freedoms\" did — and do.\" Walt Disney wrote, \"I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it.\" Rockwell believed that \"Freedom of Worship\" and \"Freedom of Speech\" were his better results in the series. Laura Claridge has written that the inspirational phrase \"Each according to the dictates of his own conscience\" is a \"platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the \"Thirteen Articles of Faith\" by Joseph Smith.\" In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression \"according to the dictates of his conscience\" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.\n\nCritical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in \"Freedom of Religion\". Claridge feels that the tight amalgam of faces ... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking. Claridge stated that the earlier version was \"clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage.\" Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the \"storytelling style\" that Rockwell is known for.\n\nDeborah Solomon considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat \"didactic\". Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the Norman Rockwell Museum, and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive. Bruce Cole of \"The Wall Street Journal\" noted that Rockwell's \"depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "897486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=897486", "title": "God is dead", "text": "God is dead\n\n\"God is Dead\" (German: ; also known as the Death of God) is a widely quoted statement by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche used the phrase in a figurative sense, to express the idea that the Enlightenment had \"killed\" the possibility of belief in God or any gods having ever existed. Others, such as proponents of the strongest form of the Death of God theology have used the phrase in a literal sense, meaning that the Christian God who existed at one point, has ceased to exist. \n\nThe phrase first appeared in Nietzsche's 1882 collection \"The Gay Science\" (, also translated as \"The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding\"). However, it is most famously associated with Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular. Other philosophers had previously discussed the concept, \nincluding Philipp Mainländer and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nDiscourses of a \"death of God\" in German culture appear as early as the 17th century and originally referred to Lutheran theories of atonement. The phrase \"God is dead\" appears in the hymn \"Ein Trauriger Grabgesang\" (\"A mournful dirge) by Johann von Rist. Contemporary historians believe that 19th-century German idealist philosophers, especially those associated with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, are responsible for removing the specifically Christian resonance of the phrase and associating it with secular philosophical and sociological theories.\n\nAlthough the statement and its meaning are attributed to Nietzsche, Hegel had discussed the concept of the death of God, in his \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" where he considers the death of God to \"Not be seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption\". Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead \"The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea.\"\n\nHegel's student Richard Rothe, in his 1837 theological text \"Die Anfänge der christlichen Kirche und ihrer Verfassung\", appears to be one of the first philosophers to associate the idea of a death of God with the sociological theory of secularization.\n\nBefore Nietzsche, the concept was popularized in philosophy by the German philosopher Philipp Mainländer.\n\nIt was while reading Mainländer, that Nietzsche explicitly writes to have parted ways with Schopenhauer. In Mainländer’s more than 200 pages long criticism of Schopenhauer’s metaphysics, he argues against one cosmic unity behind the world, and champions a real multiplicity of wills struggling with each other for existence. Yet, the interconnection and the unitary movement of the world, which are the reasons that lead philosophers to pantheism, are undeniable. They do indeed lead to a unity, but this may not be at the expense of a unity \"in\" the world that undermines the empirical reality of the world. It is therefore declared to be dead.\n\nThe idea is stated in \"The Madman\" as follows:\n\nBut the best known passage is at the end of part 2 of \"Zarathustra's Prolog\", where after beginning his allegorical journey Zarathustra encounters an aged ascetic who expresses misanthropy and love of God:\n\nNietzsche used the phrase to sum up the effect and consequence that the Age of Enlightenment had had on the centrality of the concept of God within Western European civilization, which had been essentially Christian in character since the later Roman Empire. The Enlightenment had brought about the triumph of scientific rationality over sacred revelation; the rise of philosophical materialism and Naturalism that to all intents and purposes had dispensed with the belief in or role of God in human affairs and the destiny of the world.\n\nNietzsche recognized the crisis that this \"Death of God\" represented for existing moral assumptions in Europe as they existed within the context of traditional Christian belief. \"When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one's hands.\" This is why in \"The Madman\", a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values in the absence of a divine order.\n\nThe Enlightenment's conclusion of the \"Death of God\" gave rise to the proposition that humans - and Western Civilization as a whole - could no longer believe in a divinely ordained moral order. This death of God will lead, Nietzsche said, not only to the rejection of a belief of cosmic or physical order but also to a rejection of absolute values themselves — to the rejection of belief in an objective and universal moral law, binding upon all individuals. In this manner, the loss of an absolute basis for morality leads to nihilism. This nihilism is that for which Nietzsche worked to find a solution by re-evaluating the foundations of human values.\n\nNietzsche believed that the majority of people did not recognize this death out of the deepest-seated fear or angst. Therefore, when the death did begin to become widely acknowledged, people would despair and nihilism would become rampant.\n\nMartin Heidegger understood this part of Nietzsche's philosophy by looking at it as death of metaphysics. In his view, Nietzsche's words can only be understood as referring not to a particular theological or anthropological view but rather to the end of philosophy itself. Philosophy has, in Heidegger's words, reached its maximum potential as metaphysics and Nietzsche's words warn of its demise and that of any metaphysical world view. If metaphysics is dead, Heidegger warns, that is because from its inception that was its fate.\n\nPaul Tillich as well as Richard Schacht were influenced by the writings of Nietzsche and especially of his phrase \"God is dead.\"\n\nWilliam Hamilton wrote the following about Nietzsche's view: \n\nNietzsche believed there could be positive possibilities for humans without God. Relinquishing the belief in God opens the way for human creative abilities to fully develop. The Christian God, he wrote, would no longer stand in the way, so human beings might stop turning their eyes toward a supernatural realm and begin to acknowledge the value of this world.\n\nNietzsche uses the metaphor of an open sea, which can be both exhilarating and terrifying. The people who eventually learn to create their lives anew will represent a new stage in human existence, the — i.e. the personal archetype who, through the conquest of their own nihilism, themselves become a sort of mythical hero. The \"death of God\" is the motivation for Nietzsche's last (uncompleted) philosophical project, the \"revaluation of all values\".\n\nAlthough Nietzsche puts the statement \"God is Dead\" into the mouth of a \"madman\" in \"The Gay Science\", he also uses the phrase in his own voice in sections 108 and 343 of the same book. In the madman's passage, the man is described as running through a marketplace shouting, \"I seek God! I seek God!\" He arouses some amusement; no one takes him seriously. Maybe he took an ocean voyage? Lost his way like a little child? Maybe he's afraid of us (non-believers) and is hiding? — much laughter. Frustrated, the madman smashes his lantern on the ground, crying out that \"God is dead, and we have killed him, you and I!\" \"But I have come too soon,\" he immediately realizes, as his detractors of a minute before stare in astonishment: people cannot yet see that they have killed God. He goes on to say:\n\nEarlier in the book (section 108), Nietzsche wrote \"God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we — we still have to vanquish his shadow, too.\" The protagonist in \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" also speaks the words, commenting to himself after visiting a hermit who, every day, sings songs and lives to glorify his god as noted above.\n\nWhat is more, Zarathustra later refers not only to the death of God, but states: \"Dead are all the Gods\". It is not just one morality that has died, but all of them, to be replaced by the life of the , the new man:\n\nThe cover of the April 8, 1966 edition of \"Time\" and the accompanying article concerned a movement in American theology that arose in the 1960s known as the \"death of God\". Although theologians since Nietzsche had occasionally used the phrase \"God is dead\" to reflect increasing unbelief in God, the concept rose to prominence in the late 1950s and 1960s, before waning again. The main proponents of this theology included the Christian theologians Gabriel Vahanian, Paul van Buren, William Hamilton, John Robinson, Thomas J. J. Altizer and John D. Caputo, and the rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13831", "title": "Human rights", "text": "Human rights\n\nHuman rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected as natural and legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights \"to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being\" and which are \"inherent in all human beings\", regardless of their nation, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture and execution.\n\nThe doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law, global and regional institutions. Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that \"if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights\". The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term \"right\" is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech or a right to education (including the right to comprehensive sexuality education, among others), there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard. In the light of emerging neurotechnologies, four new rights were identified: the right to cognitive liberty, the right to mental privacy, the right to mental integrity, and the right to psychological continuity.\n\nMany of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust, culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society.\n\nThe history of human rights has not been entirely progressive. Many established rights would be replaced by other less tolerant systems. Stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism.\n\nThe earliest conceptualisation of human rights is credited to ideas about natural rights emanating from natural law.\n\nThe Northeast African civilization of Ancient Egypt supported basic human rights. For example, Pharaoh Bocchoris (725-720 BC) promoted individual rights, suppressed imprisonment for debt, and reformed laws relating to the transferral of property.\n\nThe first recording of human rights were inscribed by Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, into the Cyrus Cylinder. The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay tablet created in 539 B.C. soon after the Achaemenid conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Additionally it stated the freedom to practice one's faith without persecution and forced conversions.\n\nThe Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who ruled from 268 to 232 BCE, established the largest empire in South Asia. Following the reportedly destructive Kalinga War, Ashoka adopted Buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms. The Edicts of Ashoka were erected throughout his empire, containing the 'Law of Piety'. These laws prohibited slavery, religious discrimination, and cruelty against both humans and animals.\nLater documents pertaining to human rights can be referenced in the Constitution of Medina (622), Al-Risalah al-Huquq (late 7th to early 8th century), Magna Carta (1215), the German Peasants' War Twelve Articles (1525), the English Bill of Rights (1689), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789), and the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution (1791).\n\nThe statute of Kalisz (1264), bestowed privileges to the Jewish minority in the Kingdom of Poland such as protection from discrimination and hate speech. Samuel Moyn suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of citizenship, which did not emerge until the past few hundred years.\n\n17th-century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being \"life, liberty, and estate (property)\", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract. In Britain in 1689, the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions. Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms.\n\nThese were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as Thomas Paine, John Stuart Mill and G.W.F. Hegel during the 18th and 19th centuries. The term \"human rights\" probably came into use some time between Paine's \"The Rights of Man\" and William Lloyd Garrison's 1831 writings in \"The Liberator\", in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in \"the great cause of human rights\". Although the term had been used by at least one author as early as 1742.\n\nIn the 19th century, human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery. A number of reformers, notably British Member of Parliament William Wilberforce, worked towards the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade and abolition of slavery. This was achieved across the British Empire by the Slave Trade Act 1807, which was enforced internationally by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations, and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. In the United States, all the northern states had abolished the institution of slavery between 1777 and 1804, although southern states clung tightly to the \"peculiar institution\". Conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states' secession and the American Civil War. During the reconstruction period immediately following the war, several amendments to the United States Constitution were made. These included the 13th amendment, banning slavery, the 14th amendment, assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the 15th amendment, guaranteeing African Americans the right to vote. In Russia, the reformer Tsar Alexander II ended serfdom in 1861, although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation.\n\nMany groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour. The women's rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote. National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers. One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi's movement to free his native India from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the civil rights movement, and more recent movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.\n\nThe establishment of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the 1864 Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of International humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two World Wars.\n\nThe World Wars, and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them, were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments. The League of Nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nAt the 1945 Yalta Conference, the Allied Powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the League's role; this was to be the United Nations. The United Nations has played an important role in international human-rights law since its creation. Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Analyst Belinda Cooper argued that human rights organisations flourished in the 1990s, possibly as a result of the dissolution of the western and eastern Cold War blocs. Ludwig Hoffmann argues that human rights became more widely emphasised in the latter half of the twentieth century because it \"provided a language for political claim making and counter-claims, liberal-democratic, but also socialist and post colonialist.\n\nThe CDHR was signed by member states of the OIC in 1990 at the 19th Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Cairo, Egypt. It was seen as the answer to the UDHR. In fact, the CDHR was \"patterned after the UN-sponsored UDHR of 1948\". The object of the CDHR was to \"serve as a guide for member states on human rights issues. CDHR translated the Qur'anic teachings as follows: \"All men are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the basis of race, colour, language, belief, sex, religion, political affiliation, social status or other considerations. True religion is the guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human integrity. The CDHR referenced Islamic Sharia which includes Quran, Hadith, prophetic teachings and Islamic legal tradition.\n\nThe philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights have become a part of social expectations.\n\nOne of the oldest Western philosophies of human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behaviour which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom. Other positions attempt to categorise rights into basic types, rather than make claims about the function or derivation of particular rights.\n\nThe claims made by human rights to universality have led to criticism. Philosophers who have criticised the concept of human rights include Jeremy Bentham, Edmund Burke, Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx. Canadian political philosophy professor Charles Blattberg argues that discussion of human rights, being abstract, demotivates people from upholding the values that rights are meant to affirm. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy gives particular attention to two types of criticisms: the one questioning universality of human rights and the one denying them objective ground. Alain Pellet, a French scholar on international law, criticises \"human rightism\" approach as denying the principle of sovereignty and claiming a special place for human rights among the branches of international law; French journalist Alain de Benoist questions human rights premises of human equality. American scholar David Kennedy had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in \"Harvard Human Rights Journal\".\n\nHuman rights can be classified and organised in several different ways. At an international level the most common categorisation of human rights has been to split them into civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nCivil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).\n\nThe UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:\n\nThis is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the \"full belly thesis\").\n\nThe indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights has been confirmed by the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action:\nThis statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).\n\nAlthough accepted by the signatories to the UDHR, most do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Some Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.\n\nOpponents of the indivisibility of human rights argue that economic, social and cultural rights are fundamentally different from civil and political rights and require completely different approaches. Economic, social and cultural rights are argued to be:\nSimilarly civil and political rights are categorized as:\n\nAustralian politician Olivia Ball and British scholar Paul Gready argue that for both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, it is easy to find examples which do not fit into the above categorisation. Among several others, they highlight the fact that maintaining a judicial system, a fundamental requirement of the civil right to due process before the law and other rights relating to judicial process, is positive, resource-intensive, progressive and vague, while the social right to housing is precise, justiciable and can be a real 'legal' right.\n\nAnother categorisation, offered by Czech-French scholar Karel Vasak, is that there are \"three generations of human rights\": first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. American human rights scholar Philip Alston argues:\n\nHe, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:\n\nSome human rights are said to be \"inalienable rights\". The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to \"a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms. The foundation of the United Nations and the provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for a comprehensive system of international law and practice for the protection of human rights. Since then, international human rights law has been characterised by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws. However, American analyst Pierre Leval suggested that respect for fundamental human rights in the world today (in 2013) is \"dismal\" within some nations:\n\nThe provisions of the United Nations Charter provided a basis for the development of international human rights protection in the opinion of British barrister Ian Brownlie. The preamble of the charter provides that the members \"reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the equal rights of men and women\" and Article 1(3) of the United Nations charter states that one of the purposes of the UN is: \"to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\". Article 55 provides that:\n\nOf particular importance is Article 56 of the charter: \"All Members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55.\" This is a binding treaty provision applicable to both the organization and its members and has been taken to constitute a legal obligation for the members of the United Nations. Overall, the references to human rights in the charter are general and vague. The charter does not contain specific legal rights, nor does it mandate any enforcement procedures to protect these rights.\nAccording to Shaw, the importance of human rights on the global stage can be traced to the importance of human rights within the United Nations framework and the UN Charter can be seen as the starting point for the development of a broad array of declarations, treaties, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, UN organs, committees and reports on the protection of human rights. The rights espoused in the UN charter were codified and defined in a non-binding context within the International Bill of Human Rights, composing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, partly in response to the atrocities of World War II. It is generally viewed as the preeminent statement of international rights and has been identified as being a culmination of centuries of thinking along both secular and religious lines. Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered by some to have acquired the force of international customary law which may be invoked in appropriate circumstances by national and other tribunals. The UDHR urges member nations to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights as part of the \"foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\" The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behaviour of states and press upon them duties to their citizens.\n\nThe UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt as Chair, who began to discuss an \"International Bill of Rights\" in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.\nCanadian law professor John Humphrey and French lawyer René Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. According to Cassin, the final three articles place rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realised.\nHumphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:\n\nSome of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi.\nThe inclusion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that all human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. This principle was not then opposed by any member states (the declaration was adopted unanimously, Byelorussian SSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian SSR, Union of South Africa, USSR, Yugoslavia.); however, this principle was later subject to significant challenges.\n\nThe Universal Declaration was bifurcated into treaties, a Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and another on social, economic, and cultural rights, due to questions about the relevance and propriety of economic and social provisions in covenants on human rights. Both covenants begin with the right of people to self-determination and to sovereignty over their natural resources. This debate over whether human rights are more fundamental than economic rights has continued to the present day. The United States declared after the World Food Summit that a right to be free from hunger does not give rise to any international obligations which has been interpreted as a negative duty.\n\nThe drafters of the Covenants initially intended only one instrument. The original drafts included only political and civil rights, but economic and social rights were also proposed. The disagreement over which rights were basic human rights resulted in there being two covenants. The debate was whether economic and social rights are aspirational, as contrasted with basic human rights which all people possess purely by being human, because economic and social rights depend on wealth and the availability of resources. In addition, which social and economic rights should be recognised depends on ideology or economic theories, in contrast to basic human rights, which are defined purely by the nature (mental and physical abilities) of human beings. It was debated whether economic rights were appropriate subjects for binding obligations and whether the lack of consensus over such rights would dilute the strength of political-civil rights. There was wide agreement and clear recognition that the means required to enforce or induce compliance with socioeconomic undertakings were different from the means required for civil-political rights.\n\nThis debate and the desire for the greatest number of signatories to human-rights law led to the two covenants. The Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries had argued for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called \"Unity Resolution\". Both covenants allowed states to derogate some rights. Those in favour of a single treaty could not gain sufficient consensus.\n\nIn 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states that have signed this treaty, creating human-rights law.\n\nSince then numerous other treaties (pieces of legislation) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as \"human rights instruments\". Some of the most significant, referred to (with ICCPR and ICESCR) as \"the seven core treaties\", are:\n\nIn addition to protection by international treaties, customary international law may protect some human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, genocide and slavery and the principle of non-discrimination.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions came into being between 1864 and 1949 as a result of efforts by Henry Dunant, the founder of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The conventions safeguard the human rights of individuals involved in armed conflict, and build on the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, the international community's first attempt to formalise the laws of war and war crimes in the nascent body of secular international law. The conventions were revised as a result of World War II and readopted by the international community in 1949.\n\nUnder the mandate of the UN charter, and the multilateral UN human rights treaties, the United Nations (UN) as an intergovernmental body seeks to apply international jurisdiction for universal human-rights legislation. Within the UN machinery, human-rights issues are primarily the concern of the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council, and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human-rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN in the sphere of human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security and is the only body of the UN that can authorise the use of force. It has been criticised for failing to take action to prevent human rights abuses, including the Darfur crisis, the Srebrenica massacre and the Rwandan Genocide. For example, critics blamed the presence of non-democracies on the Security Council for its failure regarding.\n\nOn April 28, 2006 the Security Council adopted resolution 1674 that reaffirmed the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\" and committed the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly, under Article 13 of the UN Charter, has the power to initiate studies and make recommendations on human rights issues.\nUnder this provision, the general assembly passed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, and since then a wide variety of other human rights instruments. The assembly has several subsidiary organs that deal with specific human rights issues, such as the Special Committee on Decolonisation and the Special Commission against Apartheid (no longer operational). In addition the general assembly has set up a number of subsidiary organs that consider human rights issues in a number of high-profile contexts: such as the UN Council on Namibia, the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practises in the Occupied territories and the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the Palestine People.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council, created at the 2005 World Summit to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, has a mandate to investigate violations of human rights.\nThe Human Rights Council is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly and reports directly to it. It ranks below the Security Council, which is the final authority for the interpretation of the United Nations Charter. Forty-seven of the one hundred ninety-one member states sit on the council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the United Nations General Assembly. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in Geneva, and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.\n\nIndependent experts (\"rapporteurs\") are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to provide the Council with reports.\n\nThe Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council take action when human rights violations occur. This action may be direct actions, may involve sanctions, and the Security Council may also refer cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.\n\nIn addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of \"treaty-based\" bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties - rather than subsidiary to the United Nations. Though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.\n\nEach treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.\n\nInternational human rights regimes are in several cases \"nested\" within more comprehensive and overlapping regional agreements. These regional regimes can be seen as relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes. Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified; the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights (the Americas) and the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Convention on Human Rights has since 1950 defined and guaranteed human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe.\nAll 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed the Convention and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\nHuman rights continue to be promoted around the world through governmental organisations and museums including the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nInternational non-governmental human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Service for Human Rights and FIDH monitor what they see as human rights issues around the world and promote their views on the subject. Human rights organisations have been said to \"translate complex international issues into activities to be undertaken by concerned citizens in their own community\".\nHuman rights organisations frequently engage in lobbying and advocacy in an effort to convince the United Nations, supranational bodies and national governments to adopt their policies on human rights. Many human-rights organisations have observer status at the various UN bodies tasked with protecting human rights. A new (in 2009) non-governmental human-rights conference is the Oslo Freedom Forum, a gathering described by The Economist as \"on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the Davos economic forum.\" The same article noted that human-rights advocates are more and more divided amongst themselves over how violations of human rights are to be defined, notably as regards the Middle East.\n\nThere is criticism of human-rights organisations who use their status but allegedly move away from their stated goals. For example, Gerald M. Steinberg, an Israel-based academic, maintains that NGOs take advantage of a \"halo effect\" and are \"given the status of impartial moral watchdogs\" by governments and the media.\nSuch critics claim that this may be seen at various governmental levels, including when human-rights groups testify before investigation committees.\n\nHuman rights defender are people who, individually or with others, act peacefully to promote or protect human rights. They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity and can act at local, national or international level. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.\n\nMultinational companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and have been responsible for numerous human rights abuses.\nAlthough the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multinational companies is both controversial and ill-defined. Multinational companies' primary responsibility is to their shareholders, not to those affected by their actions. Such companies may be larger than the economies of some of the states within which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behaviour of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable. Jean Ziegler, a Swiss professor and Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the right to food stated in a report in 2003:\n\nIn August 2003 the Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft \"Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights\".\nThese were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored.\n\nHuman rights violations occur when actions by state (or non-state) actors abuse, ignore, or deny basic human rights (including civil, political, cultural, social, and economic rights). Furthermore, violations of human rights can occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any part of the UDHR treaty or other international human rights or humanitarian law. In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws, Article 39 of the United Nations Charter designates the UN Security Council (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.\n\nHuman rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International, International Federation of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, World Organisation Against Torture, Freedom House, International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Anti-Slavery International. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of alleged human rights abuses and apply pressure to enforce human rights laws.\n\nWars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, are breaches of International humanitarian law and represent the most serious of human rights violations.\n\nIn efforts to eliminate violations of human rights, building awareness and protesting inhumane treatment has often led to calls for action and sometimes improved conditions. The UN Security Council has interceded with peace keeping forces, and other states and treaties (NATO) have intervened in situations to protect human rights.\n\nThe right to life is the essential right that a human being has the right not to be killed by another human being. The concept of a right to life is central to debates on the issues of abortion, capital punishment, euthanasia, self defence and war. According to many human rights activists, the death penalty violates this right.\nThe United Nations has called on states retaining the death penalty to establish a moratorium on capital punishment with a view to its abolition. States which do not do so face considerable moral and political pressure.\n\nThroughout history, torture has been used as a method of political re-education, interrogation, punishment, and coercion. In addition to state-sponsored torture, individuals or groups may be motivated to inflict torture on others for similar reasons to those of a state; however, the motive for torture can also be for the sadistic gratification of the torturer, as in the Moors murders.\n\nSince the mid-20th century, torture is prohibited under international law and the domestic laws of most countries. It is considered to be a violation of human rights, and is declared to be unacceptable by Article 5 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Signatories of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols I and II of June 8, 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in armed conflicts, whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited by the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which has been ratified by 157 countries.\n\nNational and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical.\nDespite these international conventions, organisations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., Amnesty International, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.\nAmnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practise torture, some of them openly.\n\nFreedom from slavery is internationally recognised as a human right. Article 4 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\nDespite this, the number of slaves today (in 2010) is higher than at any point in history, remaining as high as 12 million to 27 million,\nMost are debt slaves, largely in South Asia, who are under debt bondage incurred by lenders, sometimes even for generations.\nHuman trafficking is primarily for prostituting women and children into sex industries.\n\nGroups such as the American Anti-Slavery Group, Anti-Slavery International, Free the Slaves, the Anti-Slavery Society, and the Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society continue to campaign to rid the world of slavery.\n\nThe right to a fair trial has been defined in numerous regional and international human rights instruments. It is one of the most extensive human rights and all international human rights instruments enshrine it in more than one article.\nThe right to a fair trial is one of the most litigated human rights and substantial case law has been established on the interpretation of this human right.\nDespite variations in wording and placement of the various fair trial rights, international human rights instrument define the right to a fair trial in broadly the same terms.\nThe aim of the right is to ensure the proper administration of justice. As a minimum the right to fair trial includes the following fair trial rights in civil and criminal proceedings:\n\nFreedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, such as on libel, slander, obscenity, blasphemy, incitement to commit a crime, etc.\nThe right to freedom of expression is recognised as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognised in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the ICCPR states that \"[e]veryone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference\" and \"everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice\".\n\nFreedom of thought, conscience and religion are closely related rights that protect the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to think and freely hold conscientious beliefs and to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance; the concept is generally recognised also to include the freedom to change religion or not to follow any religion. The freedom to \"leave\" or discontinue membership in a religion or religious group—in religious terms called \"apostasy\"—is also a fundamental part of religious freedom, covered by Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nHuman rights groups such as Amnesty International organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a prisoner of conscience because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association. In legislation, a conscience clause is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical abortion) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.\n\nFreedom of movement asserts that a citizen of a state in which that citizen is present has the liberty to travel, reside in, and/or work in any part of the state where one pleases within the limits of respect for the liberty and rights of others, and to leave that state and return at any time.\n\nEvents and new possibilities can affect existing rights or require new ones. Advances of technology, medicine, and philosophy constantly challenge the status quo of human rights thinking.\n\nRight to education\n\nUN agencies, such as UNESCO, promote the right to education as a fundamental right. Education encompasses several thematic areas, including comprehensive sexuality education, which is also considered to be relevant for human rights.\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms for defence is described in the philosophical and political writings of Aristotle, Cicero, John Locke, Machiavelli, the English Whigs and others. In countries with an English common law tradition, a long-standing common law right to keep and bear arms has long been recognised, as pre-existing in common law, prior even to the existence of national constitutions.\n\nIn 1997, UNESCO adopted the \"Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generation Towards the Future Generation\". The Declaration opens with the words:\n\nArticle 1 of the declaration states \"the present generations have the responsibility of ensuring that the needs and interests of present and future generations are fully safeguarded\". The preamble to the declaration states that \"at this point in history, the very existence of humankind and its environment are threatened\" and the declaration covers a variety of issues including protection of the environment, the human genome, biodiversity, cultural heritage, peace, development, and education. The preamble recalls that the responsibilities of the present generations towards future generations has been referred to in various international instruments, including the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO 1972), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (UN Conference on Environment and Development, 1992), the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (World Conference on Human Rights, 1993) and a number of UN General Assembly resolutions relating to the protection of the global climate for present and future generations adopted since 1990.\n\nSexual orientation and gender identity rights relate to the expression of sexual orientation and gender identity based on the right to respect for private life and the right not to be discriminated against on the ground of \"other status\" as defined in various human rights conventions, such as article 17 and 26 in the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 8 and article 14 in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAs of 2011, homosexual behaviour is illegal in 76 countries and punishable by execution in seven countries.\nThe criminalisation of private, consensual, adult sexual relations, especially in countries where corporal or capital punishment is involved, is one of the primary concerns of LGBT human rights advocates.\n\nOther issues include: government recognition of same-sex relationships, LGBT adoption, sexual orientation and military service, immigration equality, anti-discrimination laws, hate crime laws regarding violence against LGBT people, sodomy laws, anti-lesbianism laws, and equal age of consent for same-sex activity.\n\nA global charter for sexual orientation and gender identity rights has been proposed in the form of the 'Yogyakarta Principles', a set of 29 principles whose authors say they apply International Human Rights Law statutes and precedent to situations relevant to LGBT people's experience.\nThe principles were presented at a United Nations event in New York on November 7, 2007, co-sponsored by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.\n\nThe principles have been acknowledged with influencing the French proposed UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, which focuses on ending violence, criminalisation and capital punishment and does not include dialogue about same-sex marriage or right to start a family.\nThe proposal was supported by 67 of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations, including all EU member states and the United States. An alternative statement opposing the proposal was initiated by Syria and signed by 57 member nations, including all 27 nations of the Arab League as well as Iran and North Korea.\n\nAlthough both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasise the importance of a right to work, neither of these documents explicitly mention free trade as a mechanism for ensuring this fundamental right. And yet trade plays a key role in providing jobs.\n\nSome experts argue that trade is inherent to human nature and that when governments inhibit international trade they directly inhibit the right to work and the other indirect benefits, like the right to education, that increased work and investment help accrue.\nOthers have argued that the ability to trade does not affect everyone equally—often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade.\n\nOn the other hand, others think that it is no longer primarily individuals but companies that trade, and therefore it cannot be guaranteed as a human right. Additionally, trying to fit too many concepts under the umbrella of what qualifies as a human right has the potential to dilute their importance. Finally, it is difficult to define a right to trade as either \"fair\" or \"just\" in that the current trade regime produces winners and losers but its reform is likely to produce (different) winners and losers.\n\nThe right to water has been recognised in a wide range of international documents, including treaties, declarations and other standards. For instance, the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) requires State parties to ensure to women the right to \"enjoy adequate living conditions, particularly in relation to … water supply\". The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires States parties to combat disease and malnutrition \"through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water\".\n\nThe most clear definition of the human right to water has been issued by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This treaty body interpreting legal obligations of State parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) issued in 2002 a non-binding interpretation affirming that access to water was a condition for the enjoyment of the right to an adequate standard of living and inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of health (see ICESCR Art. 11 & 12) and therefore a human right:\n\nOn July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly declared water and sanitation as human rights. Since then, all States have at least ratified one human rights convention which explicitly or implicitly recognises the right, and they all have signed at least one political declaration recognising this right.\n\nHuman rights include women's rights and sexual and reproductive rights. Sexual and reproductive rights are part of a continuum of human rights, which includes the rights to life, health and education, the rights to equality and non-discrimination, and the right to decide the timing, number and spacing of one's children.\n\nReproductive and sexual rights as part of human rights was affirmed internationally at the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo in 1994. It was the first among international development frameworks to address issues related to sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, and reproductive rights.\n\nThe ICPD Programme of Action in paragraph 7.2 \"defines an individual's sexual and reproductive health as complete well-being related to sexual activity and reproduction. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) encompass both entitlements and freedoms. This includes the definition of reproductive rights in paragraph 7.3 of the ICPD PoA, which clarifies that these are not a new set of rights but human rights in existing human rights instruments related to sexual and reproductive autonomy and the attainment of sexual and reproductive health. Additionally, the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action (PfA) expands this definition to cover both sexuality and reproduction by affirming in paragraph 96 the right to exercise control over and make decisions about one’s sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.\"\n\nReproductive rights were first established as a subset of human rights at the United Nations 1968 International Conference on Human Rights. The sixteenth article of the resulting Proclamation of Teheran states, \"Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.\"\n\nReproductive rights may include some or all of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to control one's reproductive functions, the right to quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence.\n\nReproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections, and freedom from coerced sterilisation and contraception, protection from gender-based practices such as female genital cutting (FGC) and male genital mutilation (MGM).\n\nIn October 2009, Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications announced that every person in Finland would have the legal right to Internet access.\nSince July 2010, the government has legally obligated telecommunications companies to offer broadband Internet access to every permanent residence and office. The connection must be \"reasonably priced\" and have a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.\n\nIn March 2010, the BBC, having commissioned an opinion poll, reported that \"almost four in five people around the world believe that access to the internet is a fundamental right\". The poll, conducted by the polling company GlobeScan for the BBC World Service, collated the answers of 27,973 adult citizens across 26 countries to find that 79% of adults either strongly agreed or somewhat agreed with the statement: \"access to the internet should be a fundamental right of all people\".\n\nNon-refoulement is the right not to be returned to a place of persecution and is the foundation for international refugee law, as outlined in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Both the right to non-refoulement and the right to asylum have taken centre stage in recent debates over the treatment of refugees. A central worry about the right to asylum is that it can limit a state's power to handle a mass influx of refugees. Processing asylum applications can take a considerable amount of time, and this amount rises with the number of refugees applying. This creates an incentive for more refugees to apply, since they are allowed to stay in the country during the application process. One potential solution to the problem of mass influx is proposed by U.S.-based political philosopher Andy Lamey. Lamey proposes a portable procedural model that focuses on the right to non-refoulement. Crucially, the procedural rights defended by this model can be applied outside national borders, within any rights respecting country; this allows the burden of mass influx to be shared by a plurality of countries without violating the procedural rights of the refugee.\n\nThere are two basic conceptions of environmental human rights in the current human rights system. The first is that the right to a healthy or adequate environment is itself a human right (as seen in both Article 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and Article 11 of the San Salvador Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights).\nThe second conception is the idea that environmental human rights can be derived from other human rights, usually – the right to life, the right to health, the right to private family life and the right to property (among many others). This second theory enjoys much more widespread use in human rights courts around the world, as those rights are contained in many human rights documents.\n\nThe onset of various environmental issues, especially climate change, has created potential conflicts between different human rights. Human rights ultimately require a working ecosystem and healthy environment, but the granting of certain rights to individuals may damage these. Such as the conflict between right to decide number of offspring and the common need for a healthy environment, as noted in the tragedy of the commons.\nIn the area of environmental rights, the responsibilities of multinational corporations, so far relatively unaddressed by human rights legislation, is of paramount consideration.\n\nEnvironmental rights revolve largely around the idea of a right to a livable environment both for the present and the future generations.\n\nWith the exception of non-derogable human rights (international conventions class the right to life, the right to be free from slavery, the right to be free from torture and the right to be free from retroactive application of penal laws as non-derogable), the UN recognises that human rights can be limited or even pushed aside during times of national emergency – although\n\nRights that cannot be derogated for reasons of national security in any circumstances are known as peremptory norms or \"jus cogens\". Such United Nations Charter obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.\n\nExamples of national security being used to justify human rights violations include the Japanese American internment during World War II,\nStalin's Great Purge, and the modern-day abuses of terror suspects rights by some countries, often in the name of the War on Terror.\n\nThe UDHR enshrines universal rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to. However, in academia there is a dispute between scholars that advocate moral relativism and scholars that advocate moral universalism. Relativists do not argue against human rights, but concede that human rights are socially constructed and are shaped by cultural and environmental contexts. Universalists argue that human rights have always existed, and apply to all people regardless of culture, race, sex, or religion.\n\nMore specifically, proponents of cultural relativism argue for acceptance of different cultures, which may have practices conflicting with human rights. Relativists caution that universalism could be used as a form of cultural, economic or political imperialism. The White Man's Burden is used as an example of imperialism and the destruction of local cultures justified by the desire to spread Eurocentric values.\nIn particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.\n\nOpponents of relativism argue that some practices exist that violate the norms of all human cultures. A common example is female genital mutilation, which occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America. It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.\n\nThe former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, and of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad both claimed in the 1990s that \"Asian values\" were significantly different from Western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. Lee Kuan Yew argued that:\n\nIn response, critics have pointed out that cultural relativism could be used as a justification for authoritarianism. An example is in 1981, when the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was \"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.\nThe Asian Values argument was criticised by Mahathir's former deputy:\n\nand by Singapore's opposition leader Chee Soon Juan, who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.\n\nDefenders of moral universalism argue that relativistic arguments neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They argue that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi. Michael Ignatieff has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.\nThis reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.\n\nAlthough the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "184483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184483", "title": "Intentionality", "text": "Intentionality\n\nIntentionality is a philosophical concept and is defined by the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" as \"the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs\". The once obsolete term dates from medieval scholastic philosophy, but in more recent times it has been resurrected by Franz Brentano and adopted by Edmund Husserl. The earliest theory of intentionality is associated with St. Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God, and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality.\n\nThe concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by Franz Brentano (a German philosopher and psychologist who is generally regarded as the founder of act psychology, also called intentionalism) in his work \"Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint\" (1874). Brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus \"psychical\" or \"mental\" phenomena, by which they may be set apart from \"physical\" or \"natural\" phenomena.\nBrentano coined the expression \"intentional inexistence\" to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena. According to some interpreters the \"in-\" of \"in-existence\" is to be read as locative, i.e. as indicating that \"an intended object ... exists in or has \"in-existence\", existing not externally but in the psychological state\" (Jacquette 2004, p. 102), while others are more cautious, stating: \"It is not clear whether in 1874 this ... was intended to carry any ontological commitment\" (Chrudzimski and Smith 2004, p. 205).\n\nA major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire, i.e. whether it involves teleology. Dennett (see below) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the \"intentional stance\". However, most philosophers use \"intentionality\" to mean something with no teleological import. Thus, a thought of a chair can be about a chair without any implication of an intention or even a belief relating to the chair. For philosophers of language, what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. This lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below.\n\nTo bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality, Husserl followed on Brentano, and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention, both in continental and analytic philosophy. In contrast to Brentano's view, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (\"Being and Nothingness\") identified intentionality with consciousness, stating that the two were indistinguishable. German philosopher Martin Heidegger (\"Being and Time\"), defined intentionality as \"care\" (\"Sorge\"), a sentient condition where an individual's existence, facticity, and being in the world identifies their ontological significance, in contrast to that which is merely ontic (\"thinghood\").\n\nOther 20th-century philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle and A.J. Ayer were critical of Husserl's concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness. Ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process, and Ayer that describing one's knowledge is not to describe mental processes. The effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content, and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing. (Sartre also referred to \"consciousness\" as \"nothing\").\n\nPlatonist Roderick Chisholm has revived the Brentano thesis through linguistic analysis, distinguishing two parts to Brentano's concept, the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect. Chisholm's writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the Scholastics, arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of Brentano's thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena. Chisholm's criteria for the intentional use of sentences are: existence independence, truth-value indifference, and referential opacity.\n\nIn current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind, intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents. John Searle argued for this position with the Chinese room thought experiment, according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content. Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine.\n\nDaniel Dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in Chapter 10 of his book \"The Intentional Stance\". Most, if not all, current theories on intentionality accept Brentano's thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom. From this thesis the following positions emerge:\n\nRoderick Chisholm (1956), G.E.M. Anscombe (1957), Peter Geach (1957), and Charles Taylor (1964) all adhere to the former position, namely that intentional idiom is problematic and cannot be integrated with the natural sciences. Members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects, which may imply some kind of dualism (though this is debatable).\n\nThe latter position, which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences, is further divided into three standpoints:\n\nProponents of the eliminative materialism, understand intentional idiom, such as \"belief\", \"desire\", and the like, to be replaceable either with behavioristic language (e.g. Quine) or with the language of neuroscience (e.g. Churchland).\n\nHolders of realism argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution. In other words, manuals for translating one language into another cannot be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects. Famously, Fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought. Dennett comments on this issue, Fodor \"attempt[s] to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them (somehow) in the 'syntax' of a system of physically realized mental representations\" (Dennett 1987, 345).\n\nThose who adhere to the so-called Quinean double standard (namely that \"ontologically there is nothing intentional, but that the language of intentionality is indispensable\"), accept Quine's thesis of the indeterminacy of radical translation and its implications, while the other positions so far mentioned do not. As Quine puts it, indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that \"manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another\" (Quine 1960, 27). Quine (1960) and Wilfrid Sellars (1958) both comment on this intermediary position. One such implication would be that there is, in principle, no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system. In other words, the behavior (including speech dispositions) of any physical system, in theory, could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution. This category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality. Dennett, for example, argues in \"True Believers\" (1981) that intentional idiom (or \"folk psychology\") is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system, then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it. Dennett calls this predictive strategy the intentional stance.\n\nThey are further divided into two theses:\n\nAdvocates of the former, the Normative Principle, argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances (Dennett 1987, 342). However, exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an Assumption of Rationality and those who adhere to the Principle of Charity. Dennett (1969, 1971, 1975), Cherniak (1981, 1986), and the more recent work of Putnam (1983) recommend the Assumption of Rationality, which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational. Donald Davidson (1967, 1973, 1974, 1985) and Lewis (1974) defend the Principle of Charity.\n\nThe latter is advocated by Grandy (1973) and Stich (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984), who maintain that attributions of intentional idioms to any physical system (e.g. humans, artifacts, non-human animals, etc.) should be the propositional attitude (e.g. \"belief\", \"desire\", etc.) that one would suppose one would have in the same circumstances (Dennett 1987, 343).\n\nWorking on the intentionality of vision, belief, and knowledge, Pierre Le Morvan (2005) has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs \"transparent\", \"translucent\", and \"opaque\" respectively. The threefold distinction may be explained as follows. Let's call the \"intendum\" what an intentional state is about, and the \"intender\" the subject who is in the intentional state. An intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions: (i) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well, and (ii) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum (i.e. if the intentional state is about a, and a = b, then the intentional state is about b as well). An intentional state is translucent if it satisfies (i) but not (ii). An intentional state is opaque if it satisfies neither (i) nor (ii).\n\nThe claim that all mental states are intentional is called intentionalism, the contrary being anti-intentionalism.\n\nSome anti-intentionalism, such as that of Ned Block, is based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or qualia is also a vital component of consciousness, and that it is not intentional. (The latter claim is itself disputed by Michael Tye.)\n\nAnother form of anti-intentionalism associated with John Searle regards phenomenality itself as the \"mark of the mental\" and sidelines intentionality.\n\nA further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional, although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them. Robert K.C. Forman argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of mystical experience are pure consciousness events in which awareness exists, but has no object, is not awareness \"of\" anything.\n\nSeveral authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be self-conscious. Cedric Evans contributed greatly to the discussion with his \"The Subject of Self-Consciousness\" in 1970. He centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36916753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36916753", "title": "Intimization", "text": "Intimization\n\nIntimization is \"a revelatory process which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as [an individuals’s] personal life – broadly defined. It is a publicity process (involving the media) that takes place over time and involves flows of personal information and imagery into the [media]\". It has mainly been studied as a society wide process in the context of politics although it can apply to other contexts.\n\nThe term intimization was first used and defined as a process by Van Zoonen in her study of Dutch television news in the 1980s. She defines it as a process whereby \"values from the private sphere are transferred to the public sphere\". This is seen not only in the greater focus on ‘human interest subjects’ but also in \"the way the relation between audience and news reader is constructed... through carefully picked personalities and intimate modes of address\".\n\nHirdman et al. use the term in their study of changes in Swedish journalism from the 1880s. They define intimization as a process which sees increased journalistic attention on the family, sexuality and the private, what they term the ‘intimate sphere’ as opposed to the public sphere. They suggest that \"modes of address, relations to sources, visual representations and focus of texts are seen to interact to create a kind of medial pseudo intimacy.\"\n\nThe term privatization has sometimes also been used to signify the same process. Rahat and Sheafer, for example, define privatization as \"a media focus on the personal characteristics and personal life of individual candidates.\" However, the use of this term is problematic as the word, most commonly associated the sale of state-owned assets, means the reverse, privatizing of something that is public not publicizing the private.\n\nStanyer argues that Intimization as a process relates primarily to media content formation and dissemination in any society and should not be conflated with para-social or tele-mediated intimacy between audiences and those who appear on TV. Horton and Wohl, writing in the 1950s were particularly interested in the relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. Horton and Wohl were not interested in the information and imagery to which audience members were exposed and made no distinction between the public and private matters but were rather interested in their illusory (para-social) relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. While not downplaying the importance of the audience, Stanyer observes it is the information and imagery to which an audience is exposed that is important in the intimization process. It is the mass exposure of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as the personal / private life of a public figure as opposed to their public/ professional life. Information and imagery we might expect only to be exchanged between those in a close relationship. In other words, public figures (politicians, celebrities, sports stars etc.) are not just familiar to us (that is recognisable) but potentially more information about their personal life circulates in the media, and the audience are exposed to more information from the private lives of public figures. An important distinction is made in this respect between familiarity and intimacy.\n\nStanyer suggests that flows of information can come from three specific areas or domains of the personal life. ‘The first domain concerns the ‘inner life’ of [a person]. This includes, for example, his or her health, well being, sexuality, personal finances, deeds, misdeeds, key milestones (such as birthdays), life experiences and achievements, but also choices about the way an individual wants to live his or her life: for example, life-style choices, ways of behaving, choice of religion or questions of taste. The second domain concerns significant others in a person’s personal life and his or her relationship with these actors. This includes relationships with partners, other immediate and extended family members, friends and extra-marital lovers. The third domain concerns an individual’s life space: this includes his or her home but it also includes happenings in locations outside the home where the individual is not performing a public function and might want privacy, such as on family holidays’\n\nWhile Stanyer observes that intimization consists of \"the publicizing of information and imagery from these three domains,\" he also notes such information can enter the public sphere with or without expressed or implied consent of those in public life and can either be scandalous in nature (it reveals a transgression of societal norms) or non-scandalous. An example of the former \"might be an act of self-disclosure on a talk show or in an autobiography which is then recycled in the media.\" Example of the latter \"might include, paparazzi photographs of politicians backstage or off-duty, taken without the subject’s permission\" revealing an extra-marital affair\n\nIn sum, drawing on these definitions initimization can be seen as a society wide ‘revelatory process’ which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from the different domains of public figures’ personal lives, either with or without expressed or implied consent of the individual involved.\n\nThe growing visibility of the private lives of public figures has been much commented on but has received little systematic attention. The findings that emerge are somewhat mixed. Errera analyzed coverage of French politicians’ private lives in two magazines \"Paris Match\" and \"VSD\" over a seven-year period between 1990 and 1997. She found that politicians’ relationships, personal health, their home and family life, personal financial issues and their past life were very much to the fore in the magazines’ coverage especially of leading French politicians, such as, Jacques Chirac and François Mitterrand.\n\nIn terms of newspaper articles referring to UK national leaders’ personal lives, Langer found a clear upward trend over time. The coverage of their private lives rose from around 1% of the leader’s coverage in 1945 to 8% during Tony Blair’s tenure in office (2007). A follow up study (period 2007-2008) showed that the coverage of opposition leader David Cameron was even more focused on his private life than that of Tony Blair, while that of Prime Minister Gordon Brown was less, suggesting the importance of specific leaders for the amount of attention their private life receives.\n\nHowever, Rahat and Sheafer, who looked at election coverage in two leading Israeli newspapers for 16 campaigns between 1949 and 2003, found no significant trend in media coverage of candidates’ personal life, with the focus on personal life never exceeding 15% of the news items over time.\n\nThe only comparative research conducted so far by Stanyer found some interesting cross national differences. Looking at non-scandalous and scandalous media coverage in seven democracies (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US) the research found that intimization is more prevalent in the UK and US compared to the other countries. Stanyer argues that there is no magic causal silver bullet, such as, new communication technologies, or tabloidization that can explain the difference between countries. Rather, the outcome is the result of a complex interplay of necessary and sufficient factors operating in conjunction. These include: personal factors including the age of the politician, media conditions, such as the size of the tabloid press and presence and absence of privacy protection for public figures, and political factors, such as the nature of the political system.\n"}

The cases involved claims of paedophile-sex-ring-performed Satanic ritual abuse, with as many as 60 children testifying they had been abused. At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years imprisoned. Thirty-four convictions were overturned on appeal. The district attorney responsible for the convictions was Ed Jagels, who was sued by at least one of those whose conviction was overturned, and who remained in office until 2009. Two convicts died in prison, unable to clear their names.\n\nIn 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan's two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a sex ring that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens' two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted in 1984 and given a combined sentence of over 1000 years in prison. The convictions were overturned in 1996 and the two couples were released. In 2001, a TV movie about the Kniffens titled \"Just Ask My Children\" was aired on Lifetime.\n\nSix similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution's key evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group: 40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. \"It never happened,\" Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a \"New York Times\" reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed. In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation. The county paid out nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims. A documentary titled \"Witch Hunt\", which focused primarily on Stoll's case, was produced and released in 2007. MSNBC also made a documentary on John Stoll and the Kern County cases.\n\nSampley and three other former accusers returned in 2004 to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said he always knew the truth—that Stoll had never touched them. However, Stoll's son has \"continued to say that he had been molested.\" In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll's pool house briefly. John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released on the new testimony. Self was sent to a mental hospital for sexual offenders because he had two prior convictions for child molestation. Self was freed in 2009. He was re-arrested in 2012 on suspicion of child molestation in Oregon. In July 2013, Self pleaded guilty to sexually abusing three young boys and was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison.\n\nPrior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir \"Michelle Remembers\" as training material.\n\n\n"}

Laius in the story of Oedipus similarly casts the latter out to die as an infant because of (in the words of Sophocles) \"some wicked spell … .

{"id": "1459946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1459946", "title": "Liberation psychology", "text": "Liberation psychology\n\nLiberation psychology or liberation social psychology is an approach to psychology that aims to actively understand the psychology of oppressed and impoverished communities by conceptually and practically addressing the oppressive sociopolitical structure in which they exist. The central concepts of liberation psychology include: conscientization; realismo-crítico; de-ideologized reality; a coherently social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.\n\nThe core ideas of liberation psychology emerged in Latin America in the 1970s in response to criticisms of traditional psychology, social psychology specifically. Psychology was criticised for its 1) value neutrality; 2) assertion of universality; 3) societal irrelevance.\n\n\nIn response to these criticisms, psychologists sought to create a psychological science that addressed social inequalities both in theory and practical application. It is important to note that liberation psychology is not an area of psychology akin to clinical, developmental, or social psychology. However, it is more of a framework that aims to reconstruct psychology taking into account the perspective of the oppressed (Martín-Baró's \"new interlocutor\") so the discipline ceases its (often unwitting) complicity with the structures that perpetuate domination, oppression and inequality. Generally, people using this framework would not call themselves \"liberation psychologists\", although this term is sometimes used to refer to them.\n\nThe term \"liberation psychology\" (or \"psicología de la liberación\") may have first appeared in print in 1976. It was later brought into widespread use by Ignacio Martín-Baró. A number of other Latin American social psychologists have also developed and promoted the approach, including Martiza Montero (Venezuela), Ignacio Dobles (Costa Rica), Bernardo Jiménez Dominguez (Colombia/Mexico), Jorge Mario Flores (Mexico), Edgar Barrero (Colombia) and Raquel Guzzo (Brazil) among others.\n\nThe genesis of liberation psychology began amongst a body of psychologists in Latin America in the 1970s. Ignacio Martín-Baró is credited as the founder of liberation psychology, and it was further developed by others.\n\nMartín-Baró was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and social psychologist who dedicated his work to addressing the needs of oppressed groups in Latin America, and ultimately was assassinated as a result of his work. His project of constructing a psychology relevant to the oppressed majorities of the American continent was therefore terminated prematurely. The collection of some of his articles in the collection \"Writings for a Liberation Psychology\" is a seminal text in the field that discusses the role of psychology as socially transformative. Most of his work still remains untranslated into English. His two major textbooks, \"Social Psychology from Central America\", and his other books are published by a small University publisher, UCA editores in El Salvador with the consequence that the breadth and depth of his work is not well known even in Latin America.\n\nThe central concepts of liberation psychology include: \"concientización\"; \"realismo-crítico\"; de-ideologization; a social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.\n\nThe intrinsic connectedness of the person's experience and the sociopolitical structure is a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology and is referred to as \"concientización\", a term introduced by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, roughly translatable as the raising of politico-social consciousness. In this process people become more conscious of themselves and their lives as structured by the social reality of oppression, understood structurally, and they thereby become social actors. They change as they begin to act on their social circumstances. Understanding this interconnectedness is of particular importance to understanding the experiences and psychology of oppressed peoples, the power structure to which they are subjugated, and the ways in which this subjugation manifests in their behavior and psychopathology.\n\nLiberation psychology criticises traditional psychology for explaining human behavior independently of the sociopolitical, historical, and cultural context. Martín-Baró argued that a failure of mainstream psychology is the attribution to the individual of characteristics that are found in the societal relations of the group. He argued that individual characteristics are a result of social relations, and to view such individualistically de-emphasizes the role of social structures, incorrectly attributing sociopolitical problems to the individual. Liberation psychology addresses this by reorienting the focus from an individualistic to a social orientation. Using this framework, the behaviour of oppressed people is conceptualized not through intrapsychic processes, but as a result of the alienating environment. \n\nThe social orientation has a particular emphasis on understanding the role of history in shaping current conditions, and the ways in which this history resulted in the oppression of particular communities. Within this orientation, critical examination of social power and its structures is crucial. This is necessary in order to understand political and social power as not being interpersonal, but part of a society's institutional organization.\n\nThe development of a psychology that is \"from\" oppressed people rather than \"for\" oppressed people is the aim of liberation psychologists. Traditional psychology is understood as Eurocentric and is critiqued for ignoring the unique experiences of oppressed individuals. Martín-Baró made a similar argument, critiquing Latin American psychologists for adopting Eurocentric psychological models that were not informed by the social, political, and cultural environment of the impoverished and oppressed, which was the majority of people in 1980s El Salvador.\n\nLiberation psychology further criticizes traditional psychology for its ivory tower approach to understanding phenomena, following Martín-Baró's call for psychology to turn its attention from its own social and scientific status to the needs and struggles of the popular majority. Unlike traditional approaches, liberation psychology seeks to re-situate the psychologist as part of the emancipatory process for and with oppressed communities.\n\nMartín-Baró contended that theories should not define the problems to be explored, but that the problems generate their own theories. This idea is termed \"realismo-crítico\". This is contrasted to the traditional approach of addressing problems based on preconceived theorization, \"idealismo-metodológico\" (methodological idealism). In \"realismo-crítico\", theorization plays a supportive, but not fundamental, role. Martín-Baró's idea of \"realism-crítico\" should not be equated with the work of Roy Bhaskar on critical realism. Although the two ideas are conceptually similar in some ways, they have distinct meanings (hence the use of the term here in Spanish, rather than attempting a direct translation).\n\nMartín-Baró emphasized the role of ideology in obscuring the social forces and relations that create and maintain oppression: a key task of psychologists then is to de-ideologize reality, helping people to understand for themselves the nature of social reality transparently rather than obscured by dominant ideology. Ideology, understood as the ideas that perpetuate the interests of hegemonic groups, maintains the unjust sociopolitical environment. Alternatively, a de-ideologized reality encourages members of marginalized populations to endorse ideologies that promote their own interests and not those of the hegemony. Martín-Baró's analysis of supposed Latin American fatalism and the myth of the lazy Latino exemplified his approach as did his use of public opinion surveys to counter the distortion that the then government and military were presenting of the Salvadorian public's views on the war.\n\nResearch with a liberation psychology framework incorporates methodologies from diverse domains. Traditional methodologies, such as surveys and quantitative analyses, are combined with more novel techniques for psychology, such as qualitative analyses, photography, drama, and textual analysis.\n\nIgnacio Martín-Baró had opposed the introduction of community psychology to El Salvador, on the basis of the ameliorative (\"asistencialista\"') approach and limited social perspective of then dominant North American models. Nevertheless, community psychology, and especially the Latin American variants (typically termed community \"social\" psychology) is one of the areas most influenced by the concepts of liberation psychology. Moreover, community social psychology in Latin America, which predates liberation psychology, also shares roots in the wider movement of Latin American critical and liberatory praxis (especially dependency theory, philosophy of liberation, liberation theology, critical or popular pedagogy).\n\nLiberation psychology departs from traditional psychological prioritization of the individual and the attribution of an individual's distress to pathology within the individual. Liberation psychology seeks to understand the person within their sociopolitical, cultural, and historical context. Therefore, distress is understood not solely in intrapsychic terms but in the context of an oppressive environment that psychologises and individualises distress.\nIn a psychotherapeutic context, this removes the onus of psychological distress solely from the individual and their immediate circumstances, and reframes the origin of distress as the environment and social structure to which persons are subjugated. Furthermore, this helps people to understand their relationship to the power structure, and the ways in which they participate in it. In liberatory approaches to mental distress the therapy is only a step towards the 're-insertion' of a person into their social milieu, social action and their existential life-project.\n\nSince the late 1990s, international congresses on liberation psychology have been held, primarily at Latin American universities. These congresses have been attended by hundreds of professionals and students, and have been crucial in perpetuating the social justice message of liberation psychology.\n\nSpecific congress themes include human rights, social justice, democratization, and creating models for liberation psychology in psychological practice and pedagogy. In recent years, these meetings have become increasingly focused on addressing issues related to poverty and economic inequality.\n\nInternational congresses on liberation psychology include:\n\nLiberation psychology is not limited to Latin America. The term was used by Philippine psychologist Virgilio Enríquez, apparently independently of Martín-Baró. Elsewhere there have been explicit attempts to apply the approach to practice in other regions. In 2011 an English language liberation psychology network was established by the British psychologist Mark Burton. It has an international membership which reflects interest in liberation psychology from psychologists who do not read Spanish or Portuguese. Moreover, not all liberatory praxis in psychology goes under the name \"liberation psychology\".\n\nMore examples needed.\nSome scholars argue that the liberation psychology framework is central to black psychology. The interconnectedness of the personal and political, a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology, is central to black psychology. Furthermore, black psychology is thought of as inherently liberationist as it argues that addressing the psychology of black persons necessitates understanding, and addressing, the history and sociopolitical power structure that has resulted in the global oppression of individuals of African descent. \n\nProponents of black psychology operate within the social orientation of liberation psychology, contending that Eurocentric ideologies of traditional psychology lack relevance when dealing with black communities. Therefore, an Afrocentric conceptualization that recognizes the unique history of individuals of African-descent is necessary when dealing with such communities. Using a liberation psychology framework, black psychology argues that simply recognizing the distinctiveness of the black experience is inadequate if the psychological theorization used does not come from the communities to which they are applied. Such a position is consistent with Martín-Baró's assertion that the use of Eurocentric psychological methods is incongruent with the lived experiences of oppressed communities.\n\nRecent work in North America has sought to understand the applied use of liberation psychology in psychotherapy with LGBT individuals. Unlike traditional psychotherapeutic interventions, this approach reframes LGBT individuals' psychological issues as resulting from an understandable incorporation of the homonegative attitudes characteristic of the social structures within which gay and transgender people live.\n\nTraditional psychotherapy typically recognises the effect of homophobia and its impact on LGBT people, but often fails to clear the person of the blame for embracing such views. However, a liberationist psychological approach aims to facilitate the freeing the individual of the blame for adopting the homonegative views of the society. Instead, the onus is on the social environment, understanding that persons are themselves constituted as persons in their social context. Such an approach understands 'psychological' issues as inextricably linked to the societal context.\n\nThis may free the LGBT person from feeling flawed for harboring homonegative ideas. They are then able to examine how they are a participant in the social environment and the ways in which they can take responsibility for future actions. Additionally, using the concept of \"concientización\", people can examine how changing themselves can challenge the oppressive nature of the larger sociopolitical system, although in most liberation psychology there is a more dialectical relationship between personal and social change where personal change does not have to precede social liberation.\n\n\n"}

This model provides a three-dimensional space of the various states of a fictitious substance with water-like properties. This plot has coordinates volume (x), entropy (y), and energy (z). It was based on the American scientist Josiah Willard Gibbs’ graphical thermodynamics papers of 1873. The model, in Maxwell's words, allowed \"the principal features of known substances [to] be represented on a convenient scale.\"\n\nGibbs' papers defined what Gibbs called the \"thermodynamic surface,\" which expressed the relationship between the volume, entropy, and energy of a substance at different temperatures and pressures. However, Gibbs did not include any diagrams of this surface. After receiving reprints of Gibbs' papers, Maxwell recognized the insight afforded by Gibbs' new point of view and set about constructing physical three-dimensional models of the surface. This reflected Maxwell's talent as a strong visual thinker and prefigured modern scientific visualization techniques.\n\nMaxwell sculpted the original model in clay and made three plaster casts of the clay model, sending one to Gibbs as a gift, keeping the other two in his laboratory at Cambridge University. Maxwell's copy is on display at the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University, while Gibbs' copy is on display at the Sloane Physics Laboratory of Yale University, where Gibbs held a professorship. A number of historic photographs were taken of these plaster casts during the middle of the twentieth century – including one by James Pickands II, published in 1942 – and these photographs exposed a wider range of people to Maxwell's visualization approach.\n\nMaxwell drew lines of equal pressure (isopiestics) and of equal temperature (isothermals) on his plaster cast by placing it in the sunlight, and \"tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface.\" He sent sketches of these lines to a number of colleagues. For example, his letter to Thomas Andrews of 15 July 1875 included sketches of these lines. Maxwell provided a more detailed explanation and a clearer drawing of the lines in the revised version of his book \"Theory of Heat\", and a version of this drawing appeared on a 2005 US postage stamp in honour of Gibbs.\n\nAs well as being on display in two countries, Maxwell's model lives on in the literature of thermodynamics, and books on the subject often mention it, though not always with complete historical accuracy. For example, the thermodynamic surface represented by the sculpture is often reported to be that of water, contrary to Maxwell's own statement.\n\nMaxwell's model was not the first plaster model of a thermodynamic surface: in 1871, even before Gibbs' papers, James Thomson had constructed a plaster pressure-volume-temperature plot, based on data for carbon dioxide collected by Thomas Andrews.\n\nAround 1900, the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, together with his student Johannes Petrus Kuenen and his assistant Zaalberg van Zelst, continued Maxwell's work by constructing their own plaster thermodynamic surface models. These models were based on accurate experimental data obtained in their laboratory, and were accompanied by specialised tools for drawing the lines of equal pressure.\n\n"}

Localization may occur either via multilateration of radio signals between (several) cell towers of the network and the phone, or simply via GPS. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the roaming signal to contact the next nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an active call. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is based on the phone's signal strength to nearby antenna masts.\n\nMobile positioning may include location-based services that disclose the actual coordinates of a mobile phone, which is a technology used by telecommunication companies to approximate the location of a mobile phone, and thereby also its user.\n\nThe technology of locating is based on measuring power levels and antenna patterns and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates wirelessly with one of the closest base stations, so knowledge of the location of the base station implies the cell phone is nearby.\n\nAdvanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by interpolating signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in urban areas where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high. Rural and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.\n\nGSM localization uses multilateration to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, or dedicated trackers, usually with the intent to locate the user.\n\nThe location of a mobile phone can be determined in a number of ways:\n\nThe location of a mobile phone can be determined using the service provider's network infrastructure. The advantage of network-based techniques, from a service provider's point of view, is that they can be implemented non-intrusively without affecting handsets. Network-based techniques were developed many years prior to the widespread availability of GPS on handsets. (See for one of the first works relating to this.)\n\nThe accuracy of network-based techniques varies, with cell identification as the least accurate and triangulation as moderately accurate, and newer \"advanced forward link trilateration\" timing methods as the most accurate. The accuracy of network-based techniques is both dependent on the concentration of cell base stations, with urban environments achieving the highest possible accuracy because of the higher number of cell towers, and the implementation of the most current timing methods.\n\nOne of the key challenges of network-based techniques is the requirement to work closely with the service provider, as it entails the installation of hardware and software within the operator's infrastructure. Frequently the compulsion associated with a legislative framework, such as Enhanced 9-1-1, is required before a service provider will deploy a solution.\n\nThe location of a mobile phone can be determined using client software installed on the handset. This technique determines the location of the handset by putting its location by cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with GPS then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier.\n\nAnother approach is to use a fingerprinting-based technique, where the \"signature\" of the home and neighboring cells signal strengths at different points in the area of interest is recorded by war-driving and matched in real-time to determine the handset location. This is usually performed independent from the carrier.\n\nThe key disadvantage of handset-based techniques, from service provider's point of view, is the necessity of installing software on the handset. It requires the active cooperation of the mobile subscriber as well as software that must be able to handle the different operating systems of the handsets. Typically, smartphones, such as one based on Symbian, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone, BlackBerry OS, iOS, or Android, would be able to run such software, e.g. Google Maps.\n\nOne proposed work-around is the installation of embedded hardware or software on the handset by the manufacturers, e.g., Enhanced Observed Time Difference (E-OTD). This avenue has not made significant headway, due to the difficulty of convincing different manufacturers to cooperate on a common mechanism and to address the cost issue. Another difficulty would be to address the issue of foreign handsets that are roaming in the network.\n\nUsing the subscriber identity module (SIM) in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) handsets, it is possible to obtain raw radio measurements from the handset. Available measurements include the serving Cell ID, round-trip time, and signal strength. The type of information obtained via the SIM can differ from that which is available from the handset. For example, it may not be possible to obtain any raw measurements from the handset directly, yet still obtain measurements via the SIM.\n\nCrowdsourced Wi-Fi data can also be used to identify a handset's location. The poor performance of the GPS-based methods in indoor environment and the increasing popularity of Wi-Fi have encouraged companies to design new and feasible methods to carry out Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning. Most smartphones combine Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and GLONASS, with Wi-Fi positioning systems.\n\nHybrid positioning systems use a combination of network-based and handset-based technologies for location determination. One example would be some modes of Assisted GPS, which can both use GPS and network information to compute the location. Both types of data are thus used by the telephone to make the location more accurate (i.e., A-GPS). Alternatively tracking with both systems can also occur by having the phone attain its GPS-location directly from the satellites, and then having the information sent via the network to the person that is trying to locate the telephone. Such systems include Google Maps, as well as, LTE's OTDOA and E-CellID.\n\nThere are also hybrid positioning systems which combine several different location approaches to position mobile devices by Wi-Fi, WiMAX, GSM, LTE, IP addresses, and network environment data.\n\nIn order to route calls to a phone, the cell towers listen for a signal sent from the phone and negotiate which tower is best able to communicate with the phone. As the phone changes location, the antenna towers monitor the signal, and the phone is \"roamed\" to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple antenna towers, a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and phase discrimination.\n\nNewer phones may also allow the tracking of the phone even when turned on and not active in a telephone call. This results from the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.\n\nA phone's location can be uploaded to a common website where one's friends and family can view one's last reported position. Newer phones may have built-in GPS receivers which could be used in a similar fashion, but with much higher accuracy. This is controversial, because data on a common website means people who are not \"friends and family\" may be able to view the information.\n\nLocating or positioning touches upon delicate privacy issues, since it enables someone to check where a person is without the person's consent. Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning.\nIn 2012 Malte Spitz held a TED talk on the issue of mobile phone privacy in which he showcased his own stored data that he received from Deutsche Telekom after suing the company. He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of Germany's data retention at the time, saying, \"This is six months of my life [...] You can see where I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing.\" He partnered up with ZEIT Online and made his information publicly available in an interactive map which allows users to watch his entire movements during that time in fast-forward. Spitz concluded that technology consumers are the key to challenging privacy norms in today's society who \"have to fight for self determination in the digital age.\"\n\nChina has proposed using this technology to track commuting patterns of Beijing city residents. Aggregate presence of mobile phone users could be tracked in a privacy-preserving fashion.\n\nIn Europe most countries have a constitutional guarantee on the secrecy of correspondence, and location data obtained from mobile phone networks is usually given the same protection as the communication itself.\n\nIn the United States, there is a limited constitutional guarantee on the privacy of telecommunications through the Fourth Amendment. The use of location data is further limited by statutory, administrative, and case law. Police access of seven days of a citizen's location data is unquestionably enough to be a fourth amendment search requiring both probable cause and a warrant.\n\nIn November 2017, the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Carpenter v. United States\" that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant.\n\n\n"}

The term \"narcissistic rage\" was coined by Heinz Kohut in 1972.\n\nNarcissistic injury occurs when a narcissist feels that their hidden, \"true self\" has been revealed. This may be the case when the narcissist experiences a \"fall from grace\", such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed, or when their importance is brought into question. Narcissistic injury is a cause of distress and can lead to dysregulation of behaviors as in narcissistic rage.\n\nNarcissistic rage occurs on a continuum, which may range from instances of aloofness and expressions of mild irritation or annoyance to serious outbursts, including violent attacks and murder. Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to personality disorders and may be also seen in catatonic, paranoid delusion and depressive episodes. It has also been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger (towards someone else), with the second layer being a self-aimed wrath.\n\nIn his 1914 case study of the \"Wolfman\", Freud identified the cause of the latter's adult neurosis as the moment when \"he was forced to realise that his gonorrheal infection constituted a serious injury to his body. The blow to his narcissism was too much for him and he went to pieces\". A few years later, in \"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\", looking at the inevitable setbacks of childhood sexuality, Freud maintained that \"loss of love and failure leave behind them a permanent injury to self-regard in the form of a narcissistic scar... reflecting the full extent to which he has been 'scorned'\".\n\nFreud's concept of what in his very last book he called \"early injuries to the self (injuries to narcissism)\" was subsequently extended by a wide variety of psychoanalysts. Karl Abraham saw the key to adult depressions in the childhood experience of a blow to narcissism through the loss of narcissistic supply. Otto Fenichel confirmed the importance of narcissistic injury in depressives and expanded such analyses to include borderline personalities.\n\nEdmund Bergler emphasized the importance of infantile omnipotence in narcissism, and the rage that follows any blow to that sense of narcissistic omnipotence; Annie Reich stressed how a feeling of shame fuelled rage, when a blow to narcissism exposed the gap between one's ego ideal and mundane reality; while Lacanians linked Freud on the narcissistic wound to Lacan on the narcissistic mirror stage.\n\nFinally object relations theory highlights rage against early environmental failures that left patients feeling bad about themselves when childhood omnipotence was too abruptly challenged.\n\nHeinz Kohut explored a wide range of rage experiences in his seminal article \"Thoughts on Narcissism and Narcissistic Rage\" (1972). He considered narcissistic rage as one major form among many, contrasting it especially with mature aggression. Because the very structure of the self itself is weakened in the narcissist, their rage cannot flower into real assertiveness; and they are left instead prone to oversensitivity to perceived or imagined narcissistic injuries resulting in narcissistic rage.\n\nFor Kohut, narcissistic rage is related to narcissists' need for total control of their environment, including \"the need for revenge, for righting a wrong, for undoing a hurt by whatever means\". It is an attempt by the narcissist to turn from a passive sense of victimization to an active role in giving pain to others, while at the same time attempting to rebuild their own (actually false) sense of self-worth. It may also involve self-protection and preservation, with rage serving to restore a sense of safety and power by destroying that which had threatened the narcissist.\n\nAlternatively, according to Kohut, rages can be seen as a result of the shame at being faced with failure. Narcissistic rage is the uncontrollable and unexpected anger that results from a narcissistic injury – a threat to a narcissist's self-esteem or worth. Rage comes in many forms, but all pertain to the same important thing: revenge. Narcissistic rages are based on fear and will endure even after the threat is gone.\n\nTo the narcissist, the rage is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them; to other people, the rage is incoherent and unjust. This rage impairs their cognition, therefore impairing their judgment. During the rage they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making groundless accusations. In his book \"The Analysis of the Self\", Kohut explains that expressions caused by a sense of things not going the expected way blossom into rages, and narcissists may even search for conflict to find a way to alleviate their pain or suffering.\n\nNarcissists are often pseudo-perfectionists and create situations in which they are the center of attention. The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose self-image. If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to guilt, shame, anger or anxiety because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love from other people if they are imperfect.\n\nBehind such perfectionism, self psychology would see earlier traumatic injuries to the grandiose self.\n\nAdam Phillips has argued that, contrary to what common sense might expect, therapeutic cure involves the patient being encouraged to re-experience \"a terrible narcissistic wound\" – the child's experience of exclusion by the parental alliance – in order to come to terms with, and learn again, the diminishing loss of omnipotence entailed by the basic \"facts of life\".\n\nWide dissemination of Kohut's concepts may at times have led to their trivialization. Neville Symington points out that \"You will often hear people say, 'Oh, I'm very narcissistic,' or, 'It was a wound to my narcissism.' Such comments are not a true recognition of the condition; they are throw-away lines. Really to recognise narcissism in oneself is profoundly distressing and often associated with denial.\"\n\nThe lead character of \"Citizen Kane\" has been considered as exhibiting narcissistic rage.\n\nBooks\n\nAcademic papers\n\n"}

It is the fourth step in the training of a sisya (disciple), consisting of preparatory practives, listening to the teachings as contained in the sruti, reflection on the teachings, and nididhyasana.\n\nNididhyasana is the final step in the correct understanding of the meaning of the Mahavakyas. Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain moksha. It consists of four stages:\n\nNididhyasana is a rational and cognitive process, which differs from dhyana (meditation). It is necessary for gaining \"Brahmajnana\":\nNididhyasana done independently of \"sravana\" does not lead to the realization of the Atman.\n\nBrihadaranyaka Upanishad (II.iv.5) defines Nididhyasana as the meditation for the sake of direct vision.Yajnavalkya tells his wife –\n\nSankara explains Nididhyasana as meditation with determination. Sankara states:-\n\nAccording to Suresvara, Nididhyasana is the culmination of the practice of \"sravana\" and \"manana\", which is an indirect intuition of Brahman and does not mean meditation but knowledge (vijnana) i.e. understanding the meaning of the Sruti on the basis of \"vacya-vacaka\" relation underlying the mahavakya. Suresvara states:-\n\nNididhyasana consists in acquisition of \"vakyarthajnana\" and this verse explains the purport of \"sunisnata\".\n\nAccording to Vacaspati, \"sravana\", \"manana\" and \"nidihyasana\" are a chain of causes contributory to the knowledge of the oneness of Brahman. The Vivarna school considers \"sravana\" as the principal cause but Suresvara treats \"sravana\" and \"manana\" to be co-existent, these two culminate into \"nididhyasana\".\n\nAccording to Madhva the knowledge acquired by study ('sravana') and stabilized by reflection ('manana') is made the basis of steady contemplation ('nididhyasana'); these are the three stages of inquiry that take the form of \"Dhyana\". Radhakrishnan has defined Nididhyasana as \"the process by which intellectual conscience is transformed into a vital one there is stillness, a calm in which the soul lays itself open to the Divine\".\n\nAccording to Michael James, who gives an Advaita Vedanta interpretation of Ramana Maharshi, Ramana's self-enquiry is the same as Nididhyasana and \"atma-vichara\".\n\n"}

The group's changing membership has included educators, artists, scientists, architects, landscape designers, curators, collectors, and others.\n\nNsumi operates fluidly, frequently collaborating with artists and collectives including Trevor Paglen, Brandon Ballengée, Rainer Ganahl, AUNTS Collective and Peter Fend, in addition to those who participate anonymously.\n\nTheir insider/outsider practice involves a range of disciplines including traditional art, trend analysis and Network theory, urban planning and mapping, interventions within ecosystems, grassroots political organizing and prefigurative politics.\n\nSometimes Nsumi fully or partially joins other art groups, adopting an individual or quasi-individual identity. Occasionally the group will exchange or swap members with different collectives, bring on temporary members, or work with artists who join the group for one-off events and exhibitions. Nsumi blurs its own boundaries since it is unclear which identity the group is operating through at a given moment or who exactly is involved. Nsumi operates under different monikers, such as Lightning Chasers, Black Magic Guild and Nsumi Group, and has been known to appear in the same group exhibition under multiple individual and group names.\n\nNsumi also appears in more conventional art exhibitions at galleries, universities and museums including the Queens Museum, Momenta Gallery, Deitch Projects and the Center for Architecture in New York City.

It is akin to what is called the sense of injustice. In some Christian doctrines, righteous anger is considered the only form of anger which is not sinful, e.g., when Jesus drove the money lenders out of the temple (Gospel of Matthew 21).\n\n\"Righteous\" means acting in accord with divine or moral law or free from guilt or sin. It may also refer to a morally right or justifiable decision or action or to an action which arises from an outraged sense of justice or morality. (See third paragraph below) \"Indignation\" is anger aroused by something unjust, mean, or unworthy. The \"Standard Dictionary\" describes indignation as a \"feeling involving anger mingled with contempt or disgust\".\n\nDaniel Whitby argues that \"Anger is not always sinful\", in that it is found among non-sinners. For example, Jesus was \"angry with the Pharisees for the hardness of their hearts; yet He had no desire to revenge this sin upon them, but had a great compassion for them\". \n\nIn Scott's comment on Ephesians 4:26, \"Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger\", he notes that \"...on many occasions, in the management of families, in reproving sin, and even in ordering their temporal concerns\", anger is permitted of Christians. Nevertheless, Scott cautions that Christians should aim to \"...be very circumspect and vigilant to restrain that dangerous passion within the bounds of reason, meekness, piety, and charity; not being angry without cause, or above cause, or in a proud, selfish, and peevish manner.\" Scott argues that Christians should not express anger in the \"language of vehement indignation\".\n\nThe \"Forerunner Commentary\" on Psalms 137:2 argues that these psalms are about the \"bitterness of exile into which God forced Judah\", purportedly with the goal of turning grief into zeal, so that the \"anger can be used to scour away sin\" by becoming \"righteously indignant\". In Richard T. Ritenbaugh's comments on Proverbs 15:18 in How to Survive Exile, he argues that it \"is alright for us to be righteously indignant as long as we do not sin.\" \n\nIn James McCosh's book \"Motive Powers\", he notes that \"We may be angry and sin not; but this disposition may become sinful, and this in the highest degree. It is so when it is excessive, when it is rage, and makes us lose control of ourselves. It is so, and may become a vice, when it leads us to wish evil to those who have offended us. It is resentment when it prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. It is vengeance when it impels us to crush those who have injured us. It is vindictiveness when it is seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us. Already sin has entered.\"\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, in the question on anger of his Summa Theologiae, quotes the Opus Imperfectum in Matthaeum, \"he that is angry without cause, shall be in danger; but he that is angry with cause, shall not be in danger: for without anger, teaching will be useless, judgments unstable, crimes unchecked,\" and concludes saying that \"to be angry is therefore not always an evil.\"\n\n"}

So, for instance, if a revolver holds six chambers, the chance is one in six. That assumes that each chamber is equally likely to come to rest in the \"correct\" position. However, due to gravity, in a properly maintained weapon with a single round inside the cylinder, the full chamber, which weighs more than the empty chambers, will usually end up near the bottom of the cylinder when its axis is not vertical, altering the odds in favor of the player. This only applies to swing-out cylinder type revolvers, and only if the cylinder is spun outside of the revolver and allowed to come to a complete stop before being locked back in. The number of pulls of the trigger before a round is expected to discharge is 3.5 (without spinning between the pulls) or 6 (with spinning between the pulls).\n\nIn Mikhail Lermontov's \"The Fatalist\" (1840), one of five novellas comprising his \"A Hero of Our Time\", a minor character places a flintlock pistol to his head, pulls the trigger and survives. However, the term \"Russian roulette\" does not appear in the story, and flintlocks do not have the necessary spinning chamber.\nThe term \"Russian roulette\" was possibly first used in a 1937 short story of the same name by Georges Surdez. However, the story describes using a gun with one empty chamber out of six, instead of five empty chambers out of six:\n\n\nThere is a drinking game based on Russian Roulette. The game involves six shot glasses filled by a non-player. Five are filled with water, the sixth with vodka. Among some groups, low quality vodka is preferred as it makes the glass representing the filled chamber less desirable. The glasses are arranged in a circle, and players take turns choosing a glass to take a shot from at random.\n\nThere is also a game called \"Beer Hunter\" (titled after the Russian Roulette scenes in the film \"The Deer Hunter\"). In this game, six cans of beer are placed between the participants. One can is vigorously shaken, and the cans are scrambled. The participants take turns opening the cans of beer right under their noses; the person who opens the shaken can (and sprays beer up their nose) is deemed the loser.\n\nRussian roulette has been portrayed in many different works of modern culture.\n\nIn 2002, Game Show Network debuted a television game show called \"Russian Roulette\". It was hosted by Mark L. Walberg.\n"}

This covers the Indian-administered regions of Jammu and Kashmir plus Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Sarmal (including Sadmal or Surmal) who are predominantly Pahari Rajputs are popularly known as Pahari Raje and are thought/believed to belong to Suryavanshi Lineage of Hindu Kshatriya Class. These Pahari Rajputs as lived in the lower hills of Dugar Desh (also known as the Dogra Rajputs). In Rajatarngini, there is mention of Thakkuras, the chiefs of the hills who acknowledged their suzerainty to strong Kashmir rulers. They are being addressed as the Lords of the country by Kalhana. Sarmals are believed to be the offshoot of these Feudal Lords so referred to as Thakkuras.\n\nMohd. Habib regards them as the actual fighters in India, much like the knights of Europe. In his words, \"the thakur could face death, that was easy for him, but he could not risk captivity\". They were so proficient in fighting that their spirit could be successfully maintained by them until old age. They provided the sure quota of soldiers required during the wars and monarch set up of Kashmir. They were lovers of horses, archery and swords.\n\nIn Kalhana Rajatarngini, these Hill-Rajas or Thakurs, are presented as playing a significant role in Kashmiri politics from the 11th century onward.\nThe Hill-Rajas allied their houses with the royal house of Kashmir through marriage. The kings of Kashmir played a correspondingly powerful role in the local politics of the Hill-Rajas. The goodwill or obedience of the Hill-Rajas must always have been a desideratum for the kings of Kashmir, in order to regulate contact between themselves and the powers of the north Indian plains.\n\nSarmals belongs to Survayansha Dynasty. It is the dynasty in which Incarnation of Lord Ram took place.\n\n\nSun dynasty is oldest among the kshatriyas.\n\nThe societies in the Himalayan region, from Jammu to Himachal Pradesh and from Himachal to Uttrakhand have a similar pattern of history, where numerous small kingdoms were scattered over hills and small valleys.\nTo term it more precisely, these kingdoms was rather fortified villages of warrior—landlords known as Thakurs and Ranas. \n\nThese Feudal Lords were Rajputs by lineage. Most of the Rajput groups in this region originated from these kingdoms, the name of which became the name of their clan.Actually, similar for Sarmal Clan which have its origin in Sauram hills of Dugar region of Samba District of Jammu & Kashmir. The family of Rajputs of Sauram Region then began to know as Sarmal who were Suryavanshi Kshatriya.\n\nA majority of them are concentrated in the Samba District of the Indian-administered Jammu & Kashmir.

Various religions and cultures take differing views of self-denial, some considering it a positive trait and others considering it a negative one. According to some Protestants, self-denial is considered a superhuman virtue only obtainable through Jesus. Some critics of self-denial suggest that self-denial can lead to self-hatred.\n\nThere is evidence brief periods of fasting, a denial of food, can be beneficial to health in certain situations. Self-denial is sometimes related to inhibitory control and emotional self-regulation, the positives of which are dealt with in those articles. As people grow accustomed to material goods they often experience hedonic adaptation, whereby they get used to the finer things and are less inclined to savor daily pleasures. Scarcity can lead people to focus on enjoying an experience more deeply, which increases happiness.\n\nOthers argue self-denial involves avoidance and holding back of happiness and pleasurable experiences from oneself that is only damaging to other people. Some argue it is a form of micro-suicide because it is threatening to an individual's physical health, emotional well-being, or personal goals.\n\nSelf-denial can constitute an important element of religious practice in various belief systems. An exemplification is the self-denial advocated by several Christian confessions where it is believed to be a means of reaching happiness and a deeper religious understanding, sometimes described as 'becoming a true follower of Christ'. The foundation of self-denial in the Christian context is based the recognition of a higher God-given will, which the Christian practicer choose to adhere to, and prioritize over his or her own will or desires. This can in daily life be expressed by renunciation of certain physically pleasureable, yet from a religious stand-point inappropriate activities, sometimes referred to as 'desires of the flesh', which e.g. could entail certain sexual practices and over-indulgant eating or drinking. In the Christian faith Jesus is often mentioned as a positive example of self-denial, both in relation to the deeds performed during his life, as well as the sacrifice attributed to his death.\n\nSelf-denial in women is linked to cultural definitions of femininity which women have internalized to such an extent that self-abnegation had become basic to women's experience. Judith Plaskow observed this and argued that it was more linked to women than men because they were to follow this Christian virtue because of their detriment. Women are seen in a domestic perspective and self-denial puts all things women were once exposed to the side so they can be committed to their marriage and family. The way women are portrayed has not changed much throughout the years because the patriarchal perspective continues to be present. Through self-denial women have to sacrifice their interests and goals to satisfy not only family, but many times social norms. They are not allowed to be independent but more so are trapped to be the individual they are expected to be. However, in men, this is different.\n\nMasculinity is linked to self-denial when put in a male perspective. Men's self-denial is both a source of men's existential alienation and part of the infrastructure of men's power. When men go through self-denial it is interpreted as self-improvement as put by the book \"Manliness\" in which they emphasize self-denial as a comparison to the image of the goal of Superman in \"What does not kill me makes me stronger\".\n\nHowever, the psychological differences between men and women are often disputed among researchers.\n\n"}
{"id": "755647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=755647", "title": "Semilattice", "text": "Semilattice\n\nIn mathematics, a join-semilattice (or upper semilattice) is a partially ordered set that has a join (a least upper bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Dually, a meet-semilattice (or lower semilattice) is a partially ordered set which has a meet (or greatest lower bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the inverse order and vice versa.\n\nSemilattices can also be defined algebraically: join and meet are associative, commutative, idempotent binary operations, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the least upper bound (or greatest lower bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order. \n\nA lattice is a partially ordered set that is both a meet- and join-semilattice with respect to the same partial order. Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding absorption laws.\n\nA set \"S\" partially ordered by the binary relation ≤ is a \"meet-semilattice\" if\n\nThe greatest lower bound of the set {\"x\", \"y\"} is called the meet of \"x\" and \"y\", denoted .\n\nReplacing \"greatest lower bound\" with \"least upper bound\" results in the dual concept of a \"join-semilattice\". The least upper bound of {\"x\", \"y\"} is called the join of \"x\" and \"y\", denoted . Meet and join are binary operations on \"S\". A simple induction argument shows that the existence of all possible pairwise suprema (infima), as per the definition, implies the existence of all non-empty finite suprema (infima).\n\nA join-semilattice is bounded if it has a least element, the join of the empty set. Dually, a meet-semilattice is bounded if it has a greatest element, the meet of the empty set.\n\nOther properties may be assumed; see the article on completeness in order theory for more discussion on this subject. That article also discusses how we may rephrase the above definition in terms of the existence of suitable Galois connections between related posets — an approach of special interest for category theoretic investigations of the concept.\n\nA \"meet-semilattice\" is an algebraic structure formula_1 consisting of a set \"S\" with a binary operation ∧, called meet, such that for all members \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" of \"S\", the following identities hold:\n\nA meet-semilattice formula_1 is bounded if \"S\" includes an identity element 1 such that \"x\" ∧ 1 = \"x\" for all \"x\" in \"S\". \n\nIf the symbol ∨, called join, replaces ∧ in the definition just given, the structure is called a \"join-semilattice\". One can be ambivalent about the particular choice of symbol for the operation, and speak simply of \"semilattices\".\n\nA semilattice is a commutative, idempotent semigroup, i.e., a commutative band. A bounded semilattice is an idempotent commutative monoid.\n\nA partial order is induced on a meet-semilattice by setting whenever \"x\"∧\"y\"=\"x\". For a join-semilattice, the order is induced by setting whenever \"x\"∨\"y\"=\"y\". In a bounded meet-semilattice, the identity 1 is the greatest element of \"S\". Similarly, an identity element in a join semilattice is a least element.\n\nAn order theoretic meet-semilattice gives rise to a binary operation ∧ such that is an algebraic meet-semilattice. Conversely, the meet-semilattice gives rise to a binary relation ≤ that partially orders \"S\" in the following way: for all elements \"x\" and \"y\" in \"S\", \"x\" ≤ \"y\" if and only if \"x\" = \"x\" ∧ \"y\".\n\nThe relation ≤ introduced in this way defines a partial ordering from which the binary operation ∧ may be recovered. Conversely, the order induced by the algebraically defined semilattice coincides with that induced by ≤.\n\nHence both definitions may be used interchangeably, depending on which one is more convenient for a particular purpose. A similar conclusion holds for join-semilattices and the dual ordering ≥.\n\nSemilattices are employed to construct other order structures, or in conjunction with other completeness properties.\n\nThe above algebraic definition of a semilattice suggests a notion of morphism between two semilattices. Given two join-semilattices and , a homomorphism of (join-) semilattices is a function \"f\": \"S\" → \"T\" such that\n\nHence \"f\" is just a homomorphism of the two semigroups associated with each semilattice. If \"S\" and \"T\" both include a least element 0, then \"f\" should also be a monoid homomorphism, i.e. we additionally require that\n\nIn the order-theoretic formulation, these conditions just state that a homomorphism of join-semilattices is a function that preserves binary joins and least elements, if such there be. The obvious dual—replacing ∧ with ∨ and 0 with 1—transforms this definition of a join-semilattice homomorphism into its meet-semilattice equivalent.\n\nNote that any semilattice homomorphism is necessarily monotone with respect to the associated ordering relation. For an explanation see the entry preservation of limits.\n\nThere is a well-known equivalence between the category formula_4 of join-semilattices with zero with formula_5-homomorphisms and the category formula_6 of algebraic lattices with compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphisms, as follows. With a join-semilattice formula_7 with zero, we associate its ideal lattice formula_8. With a formula_5-homomorphism formula_10 of formula_5-semilattices, we associate the map formula_12, that with any ideal formula_13 of formula_7 associates the ideal of formula_15 generated by formula_16. This defines a functor formula_17. Conversely, with every algebraic lattice formula_18 we associate the formula_5-semilattice formula_20 of all compact elements of formula_18, and with every compactness-preserving complete join-homomorphism formula_22 between algebraic lattices we associate the restriction formula_23. This defines a functor formula_24. The pair formula_25 defines a category equivalence between formula_4 and formula_6.\n\nSurprisingly, there is a notion of \"distributivity\" applicable to semilattices, even though distributivity conventionally requires the interaction of two binary operations. This notion requires but a single operation, and generalizes the distributivity condition for lattices. A join-semilattice is distributive if for all \"a\", \"b\", and \"x\" with there exist and such that \"x\" = \"a' \" ∨ \"b' \". Distributive meet-semilattices are defined dually. These definitions are justified by the fact that any distributive join-semilattice in which binary meets exist is a distributive lattice. See the entry distributivity (order theory).\n\nA join-semilattice is distributive if and only if the lattice of its ideals (under inclusion) is distributive.\n\nNowadays, the term \"complete semilattice\" has no generally accepted meaning, and various inconsistent definitions exist. If completeness is taken to require the existence of all infinite joins, or all infinite meets, whichever the case may be, as well as finite ones, this immediately leads to partial orders that are in fact complete lattices. For why the existence of all possible infinite joins entails the existence of all possible infinite meets (and vice versa), see the entry completeness (order theory).\n\nNevertheless, the literature on occasion still takes complete join- or meet-semilattices to be complete lattices. In this case, \"completeness\" denotes a restriction on the scope of the homomorphisms. Specifically, a complete join-semilattice requires that the homomorphisms preserve all joins, but contrary to the situation we find for completeness properties, this does not require that homomorphisms preserve all meets. On the other hand, we can conclude that every such mapping is the lower adjoint of some Galois connection. The corresponding (unique) upper adjoint will then be a homomorphism of complete meet-semilattices. This gives rise to a number of useful categorical dualities between the categories of all complete semilattices with morphisms preserving all meets or joins, respectively.\n\nAnother usage of \"complete meet-semilattice\" refers to a bounded complete cpo. A complete meet-semilattice in this sense is arguably the \"most complete\" meet-semilattice that is not necessarily a complete lattice. Indeed, a complete meet-semilattice has all \"non-empty\" meets (which is equivalent to being bounded complete) and all directed joins. If such a structure has also a greatest element (the meet of the empty set), it is also a complete lattice. Thus a complete semilattice turns out to be \"a complete lattice possibly lacking a top\". This definition is of interest specifically in domain theory, where bounded complete algebraic cpos are studied as Scott domains. Hence Scott domains have been called \"algebraic semilattices\".\n\nCardinality-restricted notions of completeness for semilattices have been rarely considered in the literature.\n\nThis section presupposes some knowledge of category theory. In various situations, free semilattices exist. For example, the forgetful functor from the category of join-semilattices (and their homomorphisms) to the category of sets (and functions) admits a left adjoint. Therefore, the free join-semilattice F(\"S\") over a set \"S\" is constructed by taking the collection of all non-empty \"finite\" subsets of \"S\", ordered by subset inclusion. Clearly, \"S\" can be embedded into F(\"S\") by a mapping \"e\" that takes any element \"s\" in \"S\" to the singleton set {\"s\"}. Then any function \"f\" from a \"S\" to a join-semilattice \"T\" (more formally, to the underlying set of \"T\") induces a unique homomorphism \"f' \" between the join-semilattices F(\"S\") and \"T\", such that \"f\" = \"f' \" o \"e\". Explicitly, \"f' \" is given by \"f' \"(\"A\") = formula_28{\"f\"(\"s\") | \"s\" in \"A\"}. Now the obvious uniqueness of \"f' \" suffices to obtain the required adjunction—the morphism-part of the functor F can be derived from general considerations (see adjoint functors). The case of free meet-semilattices is dual, using the opposite subset inclusion as an ordering. For join-semilattices with bottom, we just add the empty set to the above collection of subsets.\n\nIn addition, semilattices often serve as generators for free objects within other categories. Notably, both the forgetful functors from the category of frames and frame-homomorphisms, and from the category of distributive lattices and lattice-homomorphisms, have a left adjoint.\n\n\n\nIt is often the case that standard treatments of lattice theory define a semilattice, if that, and then say no more. See the references in the entries order theory and lattice theory. Moreover, there is no literature on semilattices of comparable magnitude to that on semigroups.\n\n"}

Founded in 2011, the \"Seshat: Global History Databank\" gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a digital storehouse for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods. The organizers of this research project contend that the mass of data then can be used to test a variety of competing hypotheses about the rise and fall of large-scale societies around the globe which may help science provide answers to global problems.\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of Cliodynamics. The main goal of Cliodynamics researchers is to use the scientific method to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories. A large interdisciplinary and international team of experts helps the Seshat project to produce a database that is historically rigorous enough to study the past using well-established scientific techniques. Seshat data may be used with sociocultural evolutionary theory or cultural evolutionary theory to identify long-term dynamics that may have had significant effects on the course of human history.\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for several research projects that examine different themes or facets of human life. Each project is led by members of the Seshat Team in collaboration with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Themes include: the evolution of social complexity in early civilizations, the creation of prosociality (i.e., how and why large groups of unrelated individuals come together and cooperate for a common goal), the role of ritual and religion in social cohesion, the causes of economic growth and its consequences on individual's well-being, and many others. The Seshat team is also heavily engaged in improving the way that cutting-edge digital technologies can aid in research, with projects devoted to developing cutting-edge systems for collecting, analyzing, and distributing information with computer assistance.\n\nSeveral key research questions drive these research projects. These include the following: What mechanisms transform economic growth into improvements in quality of life for regular people? What roles do ritual activities and religion play in cultural development and group cohesion? How and under what conditions does prosocial behavior evolve in large societies? What is the impact of environmental and climatic factors in societal advance? \n\nTo maximise their time and resources, the Seshat project has begun data collection with a representative sample of polities from around the globe and throughout human history, ranging from the late Neolithic (roughly 4,000 BCE) to the early modern period (roughly 1,900 CE). This is the World Sample 30. The World Sample-30 provides the Seshat project with an initial sample of societies that vary along the dimension of social complexity from ten major regions around the globe. Three natural geographic areas (NGAs) were selected within each region––one NGA was selected in each world region that developed complex state-level societies comparatively early; a second NGA was selected that selected complex societies comparatively late, ideally one free of centralized polities (chiefdoms and states) until the colonial period; a third NGA was selected that was intermediate to these two extremes in terms of social complexity.\n\nIan Morris (historian) recently praised two key aspects of the Seshat project: (1) it emphasizes the collection of data related to shifts in cultural systems (e.g., changes in religious morality or agricultural techniques) in addition to material elements (e.g., metallurgy technologies) and (2) it better situates seemingly extraordinary individuals in their geographic and historical context.\n\nGary Feinman also praised the Seshat Project for helping to demolish the academic knowledge silos that have emerged with increases in specialisation over the last several decades.\n\nCritics of the Seshat project have noted that the coding of historical data is not a wholly objective enterprise and that concrete and transparent steps should be taken to minimize subjectivity in the coding process. The Seshat project uses multiple coders and experts and other techniques for ensuring data quality, but some have recently suggested that machine coding techniques hold great promise for further reducing biases and increasing the reliability of the data produced.\n\nFunding for the Seshat: Global History Databank comes from the John Templeton Foundation, the Economic and Social Research Council, Horizon 2020, the Tricoastal Foundation, and the Evolution Institute.\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank is governed by an Editorial Board, which includes Prof. Peter Turchin, Prof. Harvey Whitehouse, Dr. Pieter François, Dr. Thomas E.

Many ships were lost while waiting for the tide, but little was done until this disaster. The impact of 400 bodies being washed up on an urban shore had an effect on public and official opinion. This event was the impetus to the building of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.\n\nOn 19 November 1807 several ships left Dublin carrying troops bound for the Napoleonic war. The next day, two ships, the brig \"Rochdale\" and H.M. Packet ship \"Prince of Wales\", having been caught in gale-force winds and heavy snow, were lost. Troops on \"Prince of Wales\" may have been deliberately locked below deck while the ship's captain and crew escaped. No lifeboat was launched. There was looting.\n\nThis tragedy was the impetus to the building of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which was initially called \"Dunleary\", then \"Kingstown\", and now \"Dún Laoghaire\". Dublin port was hampered by a sandbar, which meant that ships could enter or leave only at high tide. A solution, the building of the North Bull Wall, had been identified by Vice-Admiral William Bligh in 1800. If there was a storm, a ship would have to ride out the storm in the open sea, waiting for the tide.\n\n\"The bay of Dublin has perhaps been more fatal to seamen and ships than any in the world, for a ship once caught in it in a gale of wind from ENE to SSE must ride it out at anchors or go on shore, and from the nature of that shore the whole of the crews almost invariably have perished.\" – Captain Charles Malcolm of George IV's royal yacht.\nA pier had been built at Dún Laoghaire, now known as the \"coal harbour\", in 1767, but it had rapidly silted up. The early nineteenth century was unusually stormy. Dublin Bay was notoriously treacherous for boats. The remains of at least 600 vessels rest at the bottom of the bay.\n\nOn 19 November 1807, the sea began to swell. Wind speed increased to hurricane force. Sleet and snow fell to such intensity that visibility was reduced to zero; they may not have realised how close they were to shore. The east wind blew the ships back towards the shore.\n\nWhile \"Rochdale\" and \"Prince of Wales\" were lost, another troop transport, \"Lark\", which left earlier, safely reached Holyhead. Other ships were lost at that time. A collier was lost at the South Bull (outside Dublin Port). The inbound Liverpool packet was lost off Bray.\n\nIn July 1807, following military successes, Napoleon signed the Treaties of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia leaving him master of central and eastern Europe. He then turned his attention westward to Spain and Portugal. The British government was alarmed. Soldiers were recruited to defend England's coast and to intervene in Spain (see Peninsular War) under Wellington.\n\nFear of an invasion of Ireland was further met by the building of Martello Towers on the southern and eastern coasts and watchtowers on the other coastlines.\n\nFrench troops had invaded Ireland on 22 August 1798, under General Humbert, establishing the short-lived Republic of Connacht. On that occasion the Mayo Militia was ingloriously defeated in what became known as the Races of Castlebar. In 1807 many members of the North Mayo and South Mayo Militias volunteered and were lost from the \"Prince of Wales\". They joined the 97th Regiment of Foot, the Minorca Regiment, which was known as the \"Queens Own Germans\" as it was initially formed from Swiss and German mercenaries. (In 1816, the 97th was renumbered as the 96th).\n\nThe North Cork Militia was active in suppressing the Irish Rebellion of 1798. They suffered a defeat at the Battle of Oulart Hill. In 1807, while most joined the 18th Regiment of Foot so many members of the North Cork Militia volunteered that they had to be dispersed over 25 different regiments.\n\nThey joined the British Army for a shilling a week and three meals a day – an alternative to terrible poverty.\n\nHM Packet ship \"Prince of Wales\" was a sloop of 103 tons with a draught of 11 feet. She was built in Parkgate, Cheshire in 1787.\n\nShe sailed under Captain Robert Jones of Liverpool carrying the 97th regiment on 19 November. The next day she had progressed only to a point opposite Bray Head, a matter of a few miles. She cast anchor, but the sea was so violent that she failed to come to anchor; she was blown back past Dún Laoghaire. Her sails were completely torn. She was driven onto rocks at Blackrock.\nThere was just one longboat aboard. Captain Jones, nine seamen, two women with children (family members), and two soldiers escaped on this lifeboat. They did not know where they were, or how close they were to the shore. They rowed parallel to the shore until one of the sailors fell overboard and found that he was standing in shallow water.\nIt was alleged that the troops were locked below deck, the ladder withdrawn, and the hatch battened down. All 120 soldiers drowned in the storm and are interred in Merrion Cemetery not too far from where the incident occurred.\n\n\"Rochdale\" was larger than \"Prince of Wales\". She was built in 1797; she was a brig of 135 tons and a ten-foot draught. She sailed under Captain Hodgson. She was driven along a similar path as the Prince of Wales. She cast anchors but the cable snapped. On shore cries of the terrified passengers could be heard. As she swept past Dún Laoghaire, soldiers on board fired their muskets to attract attention. At Salthill, would-be rescuers had to shelter from the gunfire. Off Blackrock, blue lights were seen and gunfire heard. She stuck the rocks at the Seapoint Martello tower. A twelve-foot plank would have rescued them, but all 265, including 42 women and 29 children, on board were lost. Their bodies were unrecognisable, being mutilated by the sea and the rocks. Most of those who perished are interred in Carrickbrennan Churchyard in Monkstown with a memorial.\n\nAlthough there were lifeboats stationed at Clontarf, Bullock, Howth, Dún Laoghaire and Islandbridge none were launched.\n\nThere was looting of the ships and the items washed ashore. An immense amount of baggage was washed ashore and troops were put on guard. Looters gathered as was usual at the time and one from Dún Laoghaire was drowned. All the weekend was spent in collecting the bodies for burial. The Regimental Silver Plate of the Queens Own Germans was lost. Rewards were offered. Six persons were convicted and sent to Kilmainham Gaol for plundering bodies or articles.\n\nCaptain Robert Jones and his crew survived in the only lifeboat. Two soldiers also survived. The captain was accused of murder. The Captain said that the lifeboat was not launched; rather, it was cast into the sea by the storm, so he ordered those on deck to get into it. Anthony McIntyre of the 18th Royal Irish said that the captain launched the lifeboat and that the ladder from the hold to the deck was withdrawn. Andrew Boyle, also of the 18th Royal Irish, spoke through an Irish interpreter, saying that the ladder was not removed because “persons below held on to it very tightly”. The verdict was \"Casual death by shipwreck\". The case was dismissed.\n\nThe Irish Parliament having been abolished, from 1 January 1801 Irish members of parliament had to travel to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. That meant frequent travel across the Irish Sea.\nA campaign to build a harbour at Dún Laoghaire was already under way. The person chiefly responsible was a resident Norwegian master mariner and shipbroker named Richard Toucher, who worked tirelessly campaigning to bring about the construction of a safe port. His Asylum Harbour was conceived as a refuge for sailing ships in trouble in Dublin Bay.\nAfter this tragedy, the campaign received the support required. The term 'asylum' in this context means a harbour where ships can seek refuge from a storm.\n\nConstruction commenced on a packet harbour at Howth, which was completed in 1809. Travelling from Dublin to Howth meant travelling through the 'badlands of Sutton', where coaches were liable to be raided. Howth was a shallow harbour, and as larger ships were built, in particular with the introduction of steam packets from 1819, it became unsuitable, its rocky bottom precluded any dredging.\n\nIn 1815, eight Harbour Commissioners were appointed to supervise the building of a new harbour at Dún Laoghaire. George IV visited in 1821, arriving at Howth and departing from Dún Laoghaire. He renamed the town \"Kingstown\".\nThe name reverted to Dún Laoghaire in 1921.\n\n"}

It brought together many distinguished speakers, writers and Fellows over the years.\n\nA statement issued in 2013 by the institute on its official web site read: \"As of summer 2013, the Institute has suspended its activities following the formation of a new charity, The Idries Shah Foundation.\"\n\nThe institute was founded in 1965 by the well-known writer, thinker and Sufi teacher Idries Shah to facilitate the dissemination of ideas, information and understanding between cultures. Its Objects and Regulations were officially first adopted on 21 January 1966.\n\nIn his book \"Listening to Idries Shah\", author, psychotherapist and tutor, Ivan Tyrrell recounts a conversation in which Shah explained his reasons for founding the ICR: \"I want to attract ordinary people and help them think about psychological and cultural issues. But, as an individual, I can't easily get people to listen seriously. I discovered, however, that if I call myself an 'institute' – they will,\" Shah told him. Tyrrell adds: \"I heard [Shah] say many times over the years, 'We live in an appearance culture' [...] That is one reason why it was necessary for him to create ICR: people like to join an organisation and be part of a community.\"\n\nBased for some time at Tunbridge Wells in Kent, the institute was later based in London. Shah acted as the Institute's Director of Studies whilst still alive. Nobel Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing, who was influenced by Idries Shah, has also contributed to the Institute.\n\nThe Institute's stated aim was \"to stimulate study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture\" and to make the results of its members' academic work accessible to society and also to academics working in different fields.\n\nThe body, which had a number of distinguished Fellows, published several dozen academic monographs and some books over the years and held regular events. These events usually included a series of six lectures by specialists per year, and a two-day seminar which is usually held in the Autumn. The aim of these was \"to connect ideas across disciplines, across cultures, and even through history\" and to bring about a broader, more holistic understanding by looking at issues from several different perspectives, with particular interest in human thought and behaviour and issues neglected by contemporary culture.\n\nIn addition, the Institute supported projects in areas where freedom of access to facts was threatened, for example in the case of Afghanistan where assistance had been given to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)'s female educational projects.\n\nAll the Institute for Cultural Research's activities were open to the general public.\n\nThe institute published so many monographs and hosted so many lectures and seminars that only a small sample of notable contributors are listed here.\n\nSee also .\n\nLecturers included:\n\nMonograph writers included:\n\nBooks published by the ICR included \"Cultural Research\" edited by the writer Tahir Shah, and \"Cultural Encounters: Essays on the interactions of diverse cultures now and in the past\", edited by Robert Cecil and David Wade.\n\n\n\n"}

He obtained his doctor degree in Political Science from the Institute of Western Affairs (Instytut Zachodni), Poznań, Poland and habilitation in Cultural Studies from the Warsaw School of Social Sciences and Humanities, Warsaw, Poland.\n\nIn 1994/95, he taught in the Language Teachers' Training College (\"Nauczycielskie Kolegium Języków Obcych\"), Opole, Poland, and between 1995 and 2007 at the University of Opole, Opole, Poland. From 2002 to 2006, he did postdoctoral research in the European University Institute, Florence, Italy; the John W. Kluge Center, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., United States; the Institute for Human Sciences (\"Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen (IWM)\"), Vienna, Austria; and the Herder-Institut , Marburg, Germany. As visiting professor, in 2007–10, he taught Central and Eastern European History and Polish History and Politics in Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland, in 2010–11 at the Cracow University of Economics, Kraków, Poland; and in 2011 did research in the Slavic Research Center, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. Currently, he teaches in the School of History (Centre for Transnational and Spatial History) at the University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.\n\nIn 2004 the board of the University of Opole's Faculty of Philology formally distanced itself from the theories propagated by Kamusella in a press release published by \"Gazeta Wyborcza\", alleging methodological inadequacies and tendentious conclusions among other controversies in his historical research. However, the faculty did not allow for any open discussion of the allegations, and the release of the minutes of the faculty's public declaration was withheld for 11 years, so as to allow the Statute of limitations to kick in, due to potentially libelous statements uttered by some of the board's members.\n\n\"The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe\" (2008)—Kamusella's major synthesis of the intertwining histories, nationalisms, and languages of East Central Europe—was praised in leading academic journals, including by Yale's Timothy D.

Współpracy z Zagranicą), Self-Governmental Regional Authority (Urząd Marszałkowski), Opole. In co-operation with the University of Opole, between 1997 and 2001, he managed the application in the Council of Europe, and financing that led to the establishment of the European Documentation Center in Opole. This centre makes acquis communautaire available to the inhabitants of the Voivodeship of Opole and constituted a basis for founding a Department of Law at the University of Opole. In 1998, in the framework of the European Visitors Program of the European Union, he also visited the Spanish Autonomous Community of Galicia, which, in the following year, led to the signing of the co-operation agreement between this Spanish region and the Opole Voivodeship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3893409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3893409", "title": "Top type", "text": "Top type\n\nThe top type in the type theory of mathematics, logic, and computer science, commonly abbreviated as top or by the \"down tack\" symbol (⊤), is the \"universal\" type, sometimes called the \"universal supertype\" as all other types in any given type system are subtypes of top. In most cases it is the type which contains every possible object in the type system of interest. It is in contrast with the bottom type, or the \"universal subtype\", which every other type is supertype of and in most cases it is the type that contains no members at all.\n\nSeveral typed programming languages provide explicit support for the top type.\n\nIn statically-typed languages, there are two different, often confused, concepts when discussing the top type.\nThe first concept often implies the second, i.e., if a universal base class exists, then a variable that can point to an object of this class can also point to an object of any class. However, several languages have types in the second regard above (e.g., codice_1 in C++, codice_2 in Objective-C, codice_3 in Go), static types which variables can accept any object value, but which do not reflect real run time types that an object can have in the type system, so are not top types in the first regard.\n\nIn dynamically-typed languages, the second concept does not exist (any value can be assigned to any variable anyway), so only the first (class hierarchy) is discussed. This article tries to stay with the first concept when discussing top types, but also mention the second concept in languages where it is significant.\n\nThe following object-oriented languages have no universal base class:\n\nLanguages that are not object-oriented usually have no universal supertype, or subtype polymorphism support.\n\nWhile Haskell purposefully lacks subtyping, it has several other forms of polymorphism including parametric polymorphism. The most generic type class parameter is codice_8. Similarly in Rust, codice_9 is the most generic parameter (codice_10 is not, as it implies the codice_11 trait).\n\nThe top type is used as a \"generic\" type, more so in languages without parametric polymorphism. For example, before introduing generics in Java 5, collection classes in the Java library (excluding Java arrays) held references of type codice_4. In this way, any non-intrinsic type could be inserted into a collection. The top type is also often used to hold objects of unknown type.\n\nIn languages with a structural type system, the top type is the empty structure. For example, objects in OCaml are structurally typed; the empty object type (the type of objects with no methods), codice_13, is the top type of object types. Any OCaml object can be explicitly upcasted to this type, although the result would be of no use. Go also uses structural typing; and all types implement the empty interface: codice_3.\n\nThe top type may also be seen as the implied type of non-statically typed languages. Languages with run time typing often provide downcasting (or \"type refinement\") to allow discovering a more specific type for an object at run time. In C++, downcasting from codice_1 cannot be done in a \"safe\" way, where failed downcasts are detected by the language run time.\n\nThe notion of \"top\" is also found in propositional calculus, corresponding to a formula which is true in every possible interpretation. It has a similar meaning in predicate calculus. In description logic, top is used to refer to the set of all concepts. This is intuitively like the use of the top type in programming languages. For example, in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which supports various description logics, top corresponds to the class codice_16, where all classes are subclasses of codice_16. (the bottom type or empty set corresponds to codice_18).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34359271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34359271", "title": "Transition scenario", "text": "Transition scenario\n\nTransition scenarios are descriptions of future states which combine a future image with an account of the changes that would need to occur to reach that future. These two elements are often created in a two-step process where the future image is created first (envisioning) followed by an exploration of the alternative pathways available to reach the future goal (backcasting). Both these processes can use participatory techniques (Raskin et al., 2002) where participants of varying backgrounds and interests are provided with an open and supportive group environment to discuss different contributing elements and actions.\n\nTransition scenarios are unique in type not only in terms of how they are created (process) but also their content. Their requirements are guided by transition management concepts and consider the \"fundamental and irreversible change in the culture, structure and practices of a system\" (Sondeijker, 2009:52,). Transition scenarios are emerging as a scenario type which is more applicable to the context of sustainable development based on their abilities to capture the complexities of system structure and innovation (Loorbach, 2007; Rotmans, 2005,).\n\nThere are various types of scenarios that can be used for a range of purposes and are predominantly split between first, second and third generation scenarios.\n\nFirst generation scenarios are intended to predict the future as accurately as possible, for instance by extrapolating trends. Examples of these scenarios are weather predictions, forecasts for a wide range of topics such as economic growth, population, building volume etc. They are predominantly based on the quantitative / econometric extrapolation of trends. Another part is based on qualitative \"trend watching methods\" (e.g. fashion).\n\nSecond generation scenarios have a more explorative character. Scenarios can be intended to explore possibilities for the future, without pronouncing upon their probability or desirability. Scenarios can then be defined as \"a tool for ordering alternative future environments in which one's decision may be played out\" (Peter Schwartz, 1991,). These scenarios are based on the presumption that nobody can predict, and therefore should not try to predict the future. \"The only relevant discussions about the future are those where we succeed from shifting from the question \"whether something will happen\" to the question \"what will we do IF something happens\" (Arie de Geus, 1998,). An example of this type of scenario was developed by Shell (The Shell scenario method).\n\nThird generation scenarios focus on long time spans and preferred societal systems which are normative and explorative in nature and reflective of the structural and societal changes required in pursuing sustainability (Sondeijker, 2009; Edquist 2005,). These scenarios are intended to produce a picture of the future we want. The question then is: \"what do we actually want the future to look like?\", examples of these scenarios are based, amongst others, on the European Awareness method and include the use of energy in urban environments, sustainable production and consumption, and normative \"factor 4\" studies. These scenarios were devised based on the claim that scenarios active in first and second generation scenario methods cannot live up to the challenge of imagining, contributing and preparing for the dynamic processes of transformative change. Transitions are complex interactions which need system approaches to define paths towards a sustainable future and transition scenarios are set to address these concerns by providing a method to handle these issues.\n\nThe creation of transition scenarios has two basic objectives. To ensure that the scenario created is relevant to the concepts of transition management to allow the system to be systematically analysed and to contribute to social learning. These objectives are encapsulated in the content and process, respectively, of transition scenario creation.\n\nTransition scenarios are informed by transition management concepts and theories which it uses as a basis for its contents. In particular, transition scenarios consider long time frames and are both normative and explorative in nature. Their contents are predominantly centred on the following elements (Sondeijker 2009; Geels, F. W, 2002, Kemp et al. 1998,):\n\nMulti-level criteria relate to elements of change (weak signals) that can be identified in present structures occurring at different levels of the system. These provide the opportunity to recognise and investigate levers than can be used for long run transitions. Weak signals combined with uncertain developments can produce the appropriate climate for structural change. Anticipation of weak signals is essential if the development of scenarios beyond the scope of current developments is to be reached.\n\nMulti-pattern criteria describe the interaction between actors and structure of the system being analysed. This includes action derived from bottom-up initiatives which are built up from actor groups which are involved in niche-based innovation activities which infiltrate and eventually change the dominant regimes. Equally important are actors across and between levels which can support and further accelerate change. This ensures that practices and habits in the system are transformed through the replacement of the old dominant regime with the new desired future state.\n\nMulti-phase criteria refer to the different timings of the alternating stages involved in transition management: predevelopment phase, take-off phase, acceleration phase and the stabilisation phase. The nature and speeds of these phases inform the character of the transition highlighting the importance of the barriers and drivers identified. In the take-off phase the point of no return is reached followed by the acceleration phase where cultural, structural and practice changes occur most visibly.\n\nTransition scenarios are also process orientated focusing on the ability of different stakeholders and participants to communicate and imagine their desired future within the discussion groups. Through this participatory process participants are encouraged to change mind set and attitude to think from a long-term perspective. Specific focus on various feasible topics will increase participants' knowledge of the topic area and the alternatives available in its context. These lessons may eventually be internalised within participants resulting in a social learning process (Social Learning Group, 2001,).\n\nEurope, along with the rest of the world, is facing the challenge of climate change and its impacts on the environment, economy and society. In order to address these concerns and to adopt a proactive approach in finding solutions, the European Commission launched its Europe 2020 Strategy in 2010 followed by its Roadmap for 2050. The 2020 strategy puts forward a vision of a Europe which has increased employment, invests in research and development, ensures more young people finish school and obtain university degrees, has fewer people threatened by poverty, has a reduced greenhouse gas level of 20% compared with 1990 level, has an increased contribution of renewable energy to reach 20% of total energy consumption and has increased efficiency by 20%. The 2050 Roadmap sets forward possibilities to reaching the more stringent 80% reduction target of greenhouse gases in 2050 by considering various scenarios and setting milestones for a 40% reduction by 2030 and 60% by 2040.\n\nIt is clear from this strategy and roadmap that Europe needs to transition to a future which is quite different from the one which follows a \"business as usual\" trajectory. This need formed the basis from which the EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under its call \"Foresight to enhance behavioural and societal changes enabling the transition towards sustainable paths in Europe\" was created. Three projects focusing on transition scenarios and management were selected to provide range in application and context. These projects are as follows:\n\n"}

The version vector allows the participants to determine if one update preceded another (happened-before), followed it, or if the two updates happened concurrently (and therefore might conflict with each other). In this way, version vectors enable causality tracking among data replicas and are a basic mechanism for optimistic replication. In mathematical terms, the version vector generates a preorder that tracks the events that precede, and may therefore influence, later updates.\n\nVersion vectors maintain state identical to that in a vector clock, but the update rules differ slightly; in this example, replicas can either experience local updates (e.g., the user editing a file on the local node), or can synchronize with another replica:\n\n\nPairs of replicas, formula_1, formula_2, can be compared by inspecting their version vectors and determined to be either: identical (formula_6), concurrent (formula_7), or ordered (formula_8 or formula_9). The ordered relation is defined as: Vector formula_8 if and only if every element of formula_11 is less than or equal to its corresponding element in formula_12, and at least one of the elements is strictly less than. If neither formula_8 or formula_9, but the vectors are not identical, then the two vectors must be concurrent.\n\nVersion vectors or variants are used to track updates in many distributed file systems, such as Coda (file system) and Ficus, and are the main data structure behind optimistic replication.\n\n\n"}

Maggiora for helping intuitively analyze the disposition of amphiphilic alpha helices in heteropolar environments It is closely related to the earlier 2D diagram called a \"helical wheel\", which is a slightly idealized projection of the Calphas down the helix axis, also with one-letter-code labels and color-coded symbols to show the sequence and its properties. This diagram is named after the mosquito coil (), a coiled incense for repelling mosquitos, because of its similar shape.\nBecause the wenxiang diagram is generated by a conical projection of a helix onto a plane, with the start (N-terminus) of the helix at the edge and the end toward the center, the location of each residue in a helix is not only defined by an angle around the diagram’s center, but is also defined by its radius from the center of the diagram in number of turns, which corresponds to its distance along the helix, in number of turns. Therefore, in principle, the wenxiang diagram can be used to represent an alpha-helix of any length. The example shown is quite long, with 7 turns and sequence NIAEAVQQLNHTIVNAAHELHETLGL; its hydrophobic side is in red and its hydrophilic side in blue.\n\nWenxiang diagrams have been used to study helix-helix interactions\nand protein-protein interactions. In addition to the Wenxiang server, the helixvis package for the R programming language can also be used to generate Wenxiang graphs.\n"}
{"id": "34703162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34703162", "title": "Zero-propellant maneuver", "text": "Zero-propellant maneuver\n\nA zero-propellant maneuver (ZPM) is an optimal attitude trajectory used to perform spacecraft rotational control without the need to use thrusters. ZPMs are designed for spacecraft that use momentum storage actuators. Spacecraft ZPMs are used to perform large angle rotations or rate damping (detumbling) without saturating momentum actuators, and momentum dumping (from storage) without thrusters.\n\nSpacecraft rotational operations, such as turning to point in a new direction, are usually performed by angular momentum storage devices such as reaction wheels or control moment gyroscopes. It is generally preferable to use these devices instead of traditional thrusters, as they are powered by renewable electricity instead of by propellant; firing thrusters uses up the fixed amount of propellant on the spacecraft. Propellant is very costly because it must be carried from earth; once it is used up, the spacecraft's life is over. Therefore, the operational life of the spacecraft is determined by the amount of propellant carried, and the rate at which the propellant is used up. Propellant is used for two main purposes: to maintain the spacecraft in orbit, and to control rotation. Therefore, the less propellant that has to be used for controlling rotation, the more that is available for maintaining orbit, and the longer the lifetime of the spacecraft.\n\nHowever, momentum storage devices have a limited capacity, and that capacity soon becomes saturated when they are required to absorb spacecraft disturbance torques caused by (gravity gradient, solar wind, and aerodynamic drag); when in other words they reach their momentum storage limit. Once saturation is reached, momentum storage devices cannot apply torque to control the spacecraft's orientation. The spacecraft then typically requires thrusters using propellant to 'desaturate' the storage devices, in other words to unload the accumulated momentum, and so to restore the spacecraft's full ability to carry out rotational operations.\n\nSpacecraft experience orbital decay due to drag. To maintain their orbit, thrusters are used to reboost the spacecraft to a higher altitude. Because on board propellant capacity is limited, the spacecraft can only perform a limited number of momentum desaturations or reboosts. Therefore, if momentum desaturations can be reduced or eliminated, a larger fraction of propellant can be used to maintain the spacecraft in its desired orbit, and it will have a longer operational lifetime.\n\nTypically spacecraft rotations are performed as quaternion rotations or about a fixed axis (Euler's rotation theorem) usually referred to as an eigenaxis. Rotations about an eigenaxis result in the smallest angle between two orientations. Moreover, eigenaxis rotations are performed with a fixed rotation rate or maneuver rate. However, to maintain the spacecraft rotation about the eigenaxis, and at a fixed maneuver rate, requires the momentum storage actuators to overcome disturbance torques acting on the spacecraft. Depending on the intensity of the disturbances, the size of rotation and momentum storage device capacity, momentum storage devices can become saturated even if the spacecraft is rotated at a small maneuver rate.\n\nFortunately, however, the choice of rotation path impacts the spacecraft performance. This enables ZPMs to offer a new way to perform spacecraft rotations. Unlike eigenaxis smallest angle rotations, ZPMs are larger angle but minimum fuel rotations. Unlike eigenaxis fixed axis and maneuver rate rotations, ZPM rotations vary the rotation axis and maneuver rate during the maneuver. Just like eigenaxis rotations, ZPM rotations can be generated by commanding the spacecraft with a time varying attitude and rate command. However, ZPM rotations require significantly more time than eigenaxis rotations. ZPM trajectories can also be used to reduce propellant consumption even when the spacecraft uses thrusters instead of momentum storage devices. This application is referred to as a Reduced Propellant Maneuver (RPM) since even though propellant use is minimized some propellant will have to be used.\n\nA ZPM is a non-eigenaxis attitude trajectory that exploits the spacecraft environmental dynamics (e.g. gravity gradient, solar pressure, aerodynamics etc.) to eliminate the need for mass expulsion actuators during rotational operations.\n\nZPMs are developed by solving a specific nonlinear two-point-boundary-value optimal control problem for a fixed maneuver end time. Whereas an eigenaxis maneuver maintains a constant rotation axis and maneuver rate, a ZPM uses a time varying rotation axis and maneuver rate. An eigenaxis maneuver attitude trajectory tries to overcome disturbances to maintain a constant maneuver rate, which results in saturating the momentum storage devices. By using a variable maneuver rate, ZPMs avoid saturation of momentum storage actuators.\n\nA simplified model for a spacecraft ZPM is a sailboat. A sailboat tacks against the wind to travel in a zig-zag manner without using its outboard motors thus not using any propellant. The sailboat takes advantage of the winds just like ZPM takes advantage of spacecraft environmental disturbances. The sailboat does not take the shortest path to travel from one location to the other. Similarly, a ZPM does not take the shortest angular path between two orientations. One can think of the sailboat rudder as the equivalent of the momentum storage actuators on a spacecraft.\n\nZPMs were demonstrated on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2006 and 2007. On November 5, 2006, the ISS performed a 90 degree ZPM in 2 hours, while on March 3, 2007 the ISS performed a 180 degree ZPM in 2 hours and 47 minutes. The ZPM optimal control problems for both ISS maneuvers were solved using DIDO software.\n\nThe 90° ISS ZPM was developed by Sagar Bhatt for his Master's thesis.\n\n"}
