The letter A in front of the word japa means without (it should be understood, that ajapa means \"no chanting\", thus ajapa means to stop thinking about anything material, and japa means to think about Paramatma, God instead of thinking of maya). Thus, ajapa-japa is the practice of japa without the mental effort normally needed to repeat the mantra (effort is necessary for those who are not pure enough to dedicate themselves completely to God, and still have material desires, which is the cause of repeated reincarnation in samsara ocean). In other words, it has begun to come naturally, turning into a constant awareness. \n\nSays Swami Satchidananda: \n\nWhile the word 'japa' is Sanskrit, and the practice described here associated with Hinduism, the same basic practice and result is also found in other faith traditions. Examples include the Jesus Prayer practice of Orthodox Christianity,\nZikr or Dhikr (with alternate spellings depending on transliteration method) in Islamic contexts, particularly Sufi (6, 7), and several traditions within Catholic Christianity (8, 9).\n\nThe practice of constant remembrance evolves in stages:\n\nAt first, the practitioner intentionally repeat the syllables of the mantra internally, as if you are talking to yourself in your mind. You allow the inner sound to come at whatever speed feels comfortable to the mind. Sometimes it is very slow, as if the mind were wading through a vat of honey. At other times it is very fast, as if flying through the sky without restraint.\n\nWith practice, the mantra japa is repeated automatically, like a song that you have heard many times, which just comes on its own. (Some practitioners consider this automatic repeating to be the meaning of Ajapa-Japa, though there is a subtler meaning, as described below.)\n\nGradually, you merely remember the mantra with attention drawn to it. It is more like noticing what is already happening, rather than causing it to happen. It is somewhat like the attention stance of listening rather than speaking, though you might not literally hear the sound.\n\nIn time, the feeling of the mantra is there, even when the sound or remembering of the syllables is not there. For example, sometimes people will say, \"Om, Shanti, Shanti, Shanti,\" where the word Shanti means peace or tranquility. During the remembering of the word there may be two things—the word and the feeling of peace or tranquility. When the syllables fade away, the feeling may still be there; this is remembrance of the feeling of the mantra.\n\nAs the practice evolves, there comes a pervasive awareness of the mantra, subtler than both the syllables and any surface level meaning or definition. This constant awareness is the meaning of Ajapa-Japa of the mantra.\n"}

You reduce the stress of some difficult challenge by anticipating what it will be like and preparing for how you are going to deal with it\". There is evidence that \"the use of mature defenses (sublimation, anticipation) tended to increase with age\".\n\n\"Anticipation is the central ingredient in sexual desire.\" As \"sex has a major cognitive component — the most important element for desire is positive anticipation\". One name for pleasurable anticipation is excitement.\n\nMore generally, anticipation is a central motivating force in everyday life — \"the normal process of imaginative anticipation of, or speculation about, the future\". To enjoy one's life, \"one needs a belief in Time as a promising medium to do things in; one needs to be able to suffer the pains and pleasures of anticipation and deferral\".\n\nThere is a number of theories explaining anticipation in music. Two prominent theories are the Neurological theories of Chase that attribute expectation building and anticipation both to inherent Neurological pitch evolution (Darwinian selection as pitch/rhythm/harmony communication response expectation) and the related skillful use of chord sequences (holding V7 until expectations are met with E, A, B7, or the well known Am/D7/G tease-satisfy sequence, with variations in the wheel of fifths). \n\nA second well-accepted theory is Huron's \"ITPRA\" 5 module theory of expectation, where previous imaginative tension hits the event onset/horizon, with prediction and reaction oscillating (alternating) in the response system, and resulting in appraisal feedback.\n\nFrom a global perspective, even given thousands of varying scale types worldwide, there is a universal human sense of satisfaction in the return to that scale's tonic (for example, C, in the major scale, key, and tonic of C major).\n\nIn the context of the broader topic of Music and emotion, Juslin & Västfjäll's BRECVEM model includes, as its seventh element, Musical expectation.\n\nTechnically, anticipation also refers specifically to a type of nonchord tone.\n\n\"Note: this section refers to the process of generating the thought or feeling of anticipation in music. For titles of songs with the word Anticipation, see Anticipation (disambiguation).\"\n\nFor phenomenological philosopher Edmund Husserl, anticipation is an essential feature of human action. \"In every action we know the goal in advance in the form of an anticipation that is 'empty', in the sense of vague...and [we] seek by our action to bring it step by step to concrete realization\".\n\nAnticipation can be shown in many ways; for example, some people seem to smile uncontrollably during this period, while others seem ill or sick. It is not uncommon for the brain to be so focused on an event, that the body is affected in such a way. Stage fright is a type of anticipation, stemming from the actor or actress hoping that they perform well.\n\nThe musical \"The Rocky Horror Show\" and subsequent film use the phrase in a literal way, with Dr. Frank-N-Furter saying \"I see you shiver with antici...pation\" (holding the breath between antici- and -pation for several seconds) during \"Sweet Transvestite\". Since the movie became a cult film, it has become one of the most iconic and highly quoted lines.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1399190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1399190", "title": "Assisted reproductive technology", "text": "Assisted reproductive technology\n\nAssisted reproductive technology (ART) are medical procedures used primarily to address infertility. It includes procedures such as in vitro fertilization. It may include intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), cryopreservation of gametes or embryos, and/or may involve the use of fertility medication. When used to address infertility, it may also be referred to as fertility treatment. ART mainly belongs to the field of reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Some forms of ART are also used with regard to fertile couples for genetic reasons (preimplantation genetic diagnosis). ART may also be used in surrogacy arrangements, although not all surrogacy arrangements involve ART.\n\nWith ART, the process of sexual intercourse is bypassed and fertilization of the oocytes occurs in the laboratory environment (i.e., in vitro fertilization).\n\nIn the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—which is required as a result of the 1992 \"Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act\" to publish the annual ART success rates at U.S. fertility clinics—defines ART to include \"all fertility treatments in which both eggs and sperm are handled. In general, ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman.\" According to CDC, \"they do not include treatments in which only sperm are handled (i.e., intrauterine—or artificial—insemination) or procedures in which a woman takes medicine only to stimulate egg production without the intention of having eggs retrieved.\"\n\nIn Europe, ART also excludes artificial insemination and includes only procedures where oocytes are handled.\n\nThe WHO also defines ART this way.\n\nMost fertility medications are agents that stimulate the development of follicles in the ovary. Examples are gonadotropins and gonadotropin releasing hormone.\n\nIn vitro fertilization is the technique of letting fertilization of the male and female gametes (sperm and egg) occur outside the female body.\n\nTechniques usually used in in vitro fertilization include:\nLess commonly used techniques in in vitro fertilization are: \n\nA pre-implantation genetic diagnosis procedure may be conducted on embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization. PGD is considered in a similar fashion to prenatal diagnosis. When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration. PGD thus is an adjunct to ART procedures, and requires [in vitro fertilization to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation. Embryos are generally obtained through blastomere or blastocyst biopsy. The latter technique has proved to be less deleterious for the embryo, therefore it is advisable to perform the biopsy around day 5 or 6 of development. Sex selection is the attempt to control the sex of offspring to achieve a desired sex. It can be accomplished in several ways, both pre- and post-implantation of an embryo, as well as at birth. Pre-implantation techniques include PGD, but also sperm sorting.\n\nOther assisted reproduction techniques include:\n\nThe majority of IVF-conceived infants do not have birth defects.\nHowever, some studies have suggested that assisted reproductive technology is associated with an increased risk of birth defects.\nArtificial reproductive technology is becoming more available. Early studies suggest that there could be an increased risk for medical complications with both the mother and baby. Some of these include low birth weight, placental insufficiency, chromosomal disorders, preterm deliveries, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia(Aiken and Brockelsby).\n\nIn the largest U.S. study, which used data from a statewide registry of birth defects,\n6.2% of IVF-conceived children had major defects, as compared with 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for maternal age and other factors (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.67). ART carries with it a risk for heterotopic pregnancy (simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy). \nThe main risks are:\nOther risk factors are:\nSperm donation is an exception, with a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared to the general population. It may be explained by that sperm banks accept only people with high sperm count.\n\nCurrent data indicate little or no increased risk for postpartum depression among women who use ART.\n\nUsage of assisted reproductive technology including ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization have been associated with an increased overall risk of childhood cancer in the offspring, which may be caused by the same original disease or condition that caused the infertility or subfertility in the mother or father.\n\nThat said, In a landmark paper by Jacques Balayla et al. it was determined that infants born after ART have similar neurodevelopment than infants born after natural conception.\n\nAssisted reproductive technology procedures performed in the U.S. has more than doubled over the last 10 years, with 140,000 procedures in 2006, resulting in 55,000 births.\n\nIn Australia, 3.1% of births are a result of ART.\n\nIn case of discontinuation of fertility treatment, the most common reasons have been estimated to be: postponement of treatment (39%), physical and psychological burden (19%, psychological burden 14%, physical burden 6.32%), relational and personal problems (17%, personal reasons 9%, relational problems 9%), treatment rejection (13%) and organizational (12%) and clinic (8%) problems.\n\nSome couples find it difficult to stop treatment despite very bad prognosis, resulting in futile therapies. This may give ART providers a difficult decision of whether to continue or refuse treatment.\n\n\"For treatment-specific ethical considerations, see entries in individual subarticles, e.g. In vitro fertilisation, Surrogacy and Sperm donation\n\nSome assisted reproductive technologies can in fact be harmful to both the mother and child. Posing a psychological and a physical health risk, which may impact the ongoing use of these treatments. The adverse effects may cause for alarm, and they should be tightly regulated to ensure candidates are not only mentally, but physically prepared.\n\nMany Americans do not have insurance coverage for fertility investigations and treatments. Many states are starting to mandate coverage, and the rate of use is 278% higher in states with complete coverage.\n\nThere are some health insurance companies that cover diagnosis of infertility but frequently once diagnosed will not cover any treatment costs.\n\n2005 approximate treatment/diagnosis costs (United States, costs in US$):\nAnother way to look at costs is to determine the expected cost of establishing a pregnancy. Thus if a clomiphene treatment has a chance to establish a pregnancy in 8% of cycles and costs $500, the expected cost is $6,000 to establish a pregnancy, compared to an IVF cycle (cycle fecundity 40%) with a corresponding expected cost of $30,000 ($12,000/.4).\n\nFor the community as a whole, the cost of IVF on average pays back by 700% by tax from future employment by the conceived human being.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, all patients have the right to preliminary testing, provided free of charge by the National Health Service. However, treatment is not widely available on the NHS and there can be long waiting lists. Many patients therefore pay for immediate treatment within the NHS or seek help from private clinics.\n\nIn 2013, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published new guidelines about who should have access to IVF treatment on the NHS in England and Wales.\n\nThe guidelines also say women aged between 40 and 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS if all of the following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age. However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.\n\nThis policy is often modified by local Clinical Commissioning Groups, in a fairly blatant breach of the NHS Constitution for England which provides that patients have the right to drugs and treatments that have been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS. For example, the Cheshire, Merseyside and West Lancashire Clinical Commissioning Group insists on additional conditions:\n\nSome treatments are covered by OHIP (public health insurance) in Ontario and others are not. Those with bilaterally blocked fallopian tubes and under 40 have treatment is covered but are still required to pay lab fees (around $3,000–4,000). Coverage varies in other provinces. Most other patients are required to pay for treatments themselves.\n\nIsrael's national health insurance, which is mandatory for all Israeli citizens, covers nearly all fertility treatments. IVF costs are fully subsidized up to the birth of two children for all Israeli women, including single women and lesbian couples. Embryo transfers for purposes of gestational surrogacy are also covered.\n\nOn 27 January 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional, that the health insurance companies have to bear only 50% of the cost for IVF. On 2 March 2012, the Federal Council has approved a draft law of some federal states, which provides that the federal government provides a subsidy of 25% to the cost. Thus, the share of costs borne for the pair would drop to just 25%.\n\nFilms and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades. Yet, the number of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles are huge.\n\n\"For specific examples, refer to the fiction sections in individual subarticles, e.g. surrogacy, sperm donation and fertility clinic.\"\n\nIn addition, reproduction and pregnancy in speculative fiction has been present for many decades.\n\nThe idea of using future ART techniques, including direct human germline engineering technologies, to select and genetically modify embryos for the purpose of human enhancement has been referred to as designer babies, reprogenetics, and liberal eugenics and has been discussed since the introduction of biotechnology in the late 1970s. \n\nThe term \"liberal eugenics\" was coined by bioethicist Nicholas Agar. Liberal eugenics is aimed at \"improving\" the genotypes of future generations through screening and genetic modification to eliminate \"undesirable\" traits. The term \"reprogenetics\" was coined by Lee M. Silver, a professor of molecular biology at Princeton University, in his 1997 book \"Remaking Eden\".\n\nThe philosophical movement associated with these speculative uses is transhumanism. When eugenics is discussed in this context it usually in context of allowing parents to select desirable traits in an unborn child and not in the use of genetics to destroy embryos or to prevent the formation of undesirable embryos.\n\nSafety is a major concern when it comes to the gene editing and mitochondrial transfer, as problems may not arise in the first children for many years, and their offspring may be affected, and problems may only appear in those subsequent generations. New diseases may be introduced accidentally. \n\nNeither the first generation nor their offspring will have given consent to have been treated. On a larger scale, germline modification has the potential to impact the gene pool of the entire human race in a negative or positive way. \n\nAnother concern, especially for people who believe that life begins at conception, is the fate of flawed or unchosen embryos created during the work of reaching an embryo with the the desired qualities. The embryo cannot give consent and some of the treatments have long-lasting and harmful implications. \n\nIn many countries, editing embryos and germline modification is illegal. As of 2015, 15 of 22 Western European nations had outlawed human germline engineering. Human germline modification has for many years has been heavily off limits. As of 2016 there was no legislation in the United States that explicitly prohibited germline engineering, however, the \"Consolidated Appropriation Act of 2016\" banned the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) funds to engage in research regarding human germline modifications.\n\nGermline modification is considered a more ethically and morally acceptable treatment when one or both of the parents is a carrier for a harmful trait and is treated to improve the genotype and safety of the future generations. When the treatment is used for this purpose, it can fill the gaps that other technologies may not be able to accomplish. The American National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Medicine gave qualified support to human genome editing in 2017 once answers have been found to safety and efficiency problems \"but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.\" Germline modification would be more practical if sampling methods were less destructive and used the polar bodies rather than embryos. In 2018, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics issued a report which concluded that under certain circumstances, editing of the DNA of human embryos could be acceptable. The Nuffield Council is a British independent organisation that evaluates ethical questions in medicine and biology.\n\nLee Silver has projected a dystopia in which a race of superior humans look down on those without genetic enhancements, though others have counseled against accepting this vision of the future. It has also been suggested that if designer babies were created through genetic engineering, that this could have deleterious effects on the human gene pool. Some futurists claim that it would put the human species on a path to participant evolution. It has also been argued that designer babies may have an important role as counter-acting an argued dysgenic trend.\n\nIn November 2018, He Jiankui announced that he had edited the genomes of two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for CCR5, which codes for a receptor that HIV uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 (mosaicism) and were still vulnerable to HIV. The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature. Carl Zimmer compared the reaction to He's human gene editing experiment to the initial reactions and subsequent debate over mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) and the eventual regulatory approval of MRT in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1172067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1172067", "title": "Catch-22 (logic)", "text": "Catch-22 (logic)\n\nA catch-22 is a paradoxical situation from which an individual cannot escape because of contradictory rules. The term was coined by Joseph Heller, who used it in his 1961 novel \"Catch-22\".\n\nAn example is:\n\nCatch-22s often result from rules, regulations, or procedures that an individual is subject to, but has no control over, because to fight the rule is to accept it. Another example is a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it (\"e.g\", a bank will never issue someone a loan if they \"need\" the money). One connotation of the term is that the creators of the \"catch-22\" situation have created arbitrary rules in order to justify and conceal their own abuse of power.\n\nJoseph Heller coined the term in his 1961 novel \"Catch-22\", which describes absurd bureaucratic constraints on soldiers in World War II. The term is introduced by the character Doc Daneeka, an army psychiatrist who invokes \"Catch-22\" to explain why any pilot requesting mental evaluation for insanity—hoping to be found not sane enough to fly and thereby escape dangerous missions—demonstrates his own sanity in creating the request and thus cannot be declared insane. This phrase also means a dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.\n\nDifferent formulations of \"Catch-22\" appear throughout the novel. The term is applied to various loopholes and quirks of the military system, always with the implication that rules are inaccessible to and slanted against those lower in the hierarchy. In chapter 6, Yossarian (the pilot) is told that Catch-22 requires him to do anything his commanding officer tells him to do, regardless of whether these orders contradict orders from the officer's superiors.\n\nIn a final episode, Catch-22 is described to Yossarian by an old woman recounting an act of violence by soldiers:\n\nAccording to literature professor Ian Gregson, the old woman's narrative defines \"Catch-22\" more directly as the \"brutal operation of power\", stripping away the \"bogus sophistication\" of the earlier scenarios.\n\nBesides referring to an unsolvable logical dilemma, Catch-22 is invoked to explain or justify the military bureaucracy. For example, in the first chapter, it requires Yossarian to sign his name to letters that he censors while he is confined to a hospital bed. One clause mentioned in chapter 10 closes a loophole in promotions, which one private had been exploiting to reattain the attractive rank of Private First Class after any promotion. Through courts-martial for going AWOL, he would be busted in rank back to private, but Catch-22 limited the number of times he could do this before being sent to the stockade.\n\nAt another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected.\n\nAt one point, Captain Black attempts to press Milo into depriving Major Major of food as a consequence of not signing a loyalty oath that Major Major was never given an opportunity to sign in the first place. Captain Black asks Milo, \"You're not against Catch-22, are you?\"\n\nIn chapter 40, Catch-22 forces Colonels Korn and Cathcart to promote Yossarian to Major and ground him rather than simply sending him home. They fear that if they do not, others will refuse to fly, just as Yossarian did.\n\nHeller originally wanted to call the phrase (and hence, the book) by other numbers, but he and his publishers eventually settled on 22. The number has no particular significance; it was chosen more or less for euphony. The title was originally \"Catch-18\", but Heller changed it after the popular \"Mila 18\" was published a short time beforehand.\n\nThe term \"catch-22\" has filtered into common usage in the English language. In a 1975 interview, Heller said the term would not translate well into other languages.\n\nJames E. Combs and Dan D. Nimmo suggest that the idea of a \"catch-22\" has gained popular currency because so many people in modern society are exposed to frustrating bureaucratic logic. They write:\n\nEveryone, then, who deals with organizations understands the bureaucratic logic of Catch-22. In high school or college, for example, students can participate in student government, a form of self-government and democracy that allows them to decide whatever they want, just so long as the principal or dean of students approves. This bogus democracy that can be overruled by arbitrary fiat is perhaps a citizen's first encounter with organizations that may profess 'open' and libertarian values, but in fact are closed and hierarchical systems. Catch-22 is an organizational assumption, an unwritten law of informal power that exempts the organization from responsibility and accountability, and puts the individual in the absurd position of being excepted for the convenience or unknown purposes of the organization.\n\nAlong with George Orwell's \"doublethink\", \"Catch-22\" has become one of the best-recognized ways to describe the predicament of being trapped by contradictory rules.\n\nA significant type of definition of alternative medicine has been termed a catch-22. In a 1998 editorial co-authored by Marcia Angell, a former editor of the \"New England Journal of Medicine\", argued that:\n\n\"It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.\"\n\nThis definition has been described by Robert L. Park as a logical catch-22 which ensures that any method which is proven to work \"would no longer be CAM, it would simply be medicine.\"\n\nThe archetypal \"catch-22\", as formulated by Heller, involves the case of John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces bombardier, who wishes to be grounded from combat flight. This will only happen if he is evaluated by the squadron's flight surgeon and found \"unfit to fly\". \"Unfit\" would be any pilot who is willing to fly such dangerous missions, as one would have to be mad to volunteer for possible death. However, to be evaluated, he must \"request\" the evaluation, an act that is considered sufficient proof for being declared sane. These conditions make it impossible to be declared \"unfit\".\n\nThe \"Catch-22\" is that \"anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\". Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation \"are\" sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.\n\nTherefore, Catch-22 ensures that no pilot can ever be grounded for being insane even if he is.\n\nA logical formulation of this situation is:\nThe philosopher Laurence Goldstein argues that the \"airman's dilemma\" is logically not even a condition that is true under no circumstances; it is a \"vacuous biconditional\" that is ultimately meaningless. Goldstein writes:\n"}

A collineation is thus an \"isomorphism\" between projective spaces, or an automorphism from a projective space to itself. Some authors restrict the definition of collineation to the case where it is an automorphism. The set of all collineations of a space to itself form a group, called the collineation group.\n\nSimply, a collineation is a one-to-one map from one projective space to another, or from a projective space to itself, such that the images of collinear points are themselves collinear. One may formalize this using various ways of presenting a projective space. Also, the case of the projective line is special, and hence generally treated differently.\n\nFor a projective space defined in terms of linear algebra (as the projectivization of a vector space), a collineation is a map between the projective spaces that is order-preserving with respect to inclusion of subspaces.\n\nFormally, let \"V\" be a vector space over a field \"K\" and \"W\" a vector space over a field \"L\". Consider the projective spaces \"PG\"(\"V\") and \"PG\"(\"W\"), consisting of the vector lines of \"V\" and \"W\". \nCall \"D\"(\"V\") and \"D\"(\"W\") the set of subspaces of \"V\" and \"W\" respectively. A collineation from \"PG\"(\"V\") to \"PG\"(\"W\") is a map α : \"D\"(\"V\") → \"D\"(\"W\"), such that:\n\nGiven a projective space defined axiomatically in terms of an incidence structure (a set of points \"P,\" lines \"L,\" and an incidence relation \"I\" specifying which points lie on which lines, satisfying certain axioms), a collineation between projective spaces thus defined then being a bijective function \"f\" between the sets of points and a bijective function \"g\" between the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation.\n\nEvery projective space of dimension greater than or equal to three is isomorphic to the projectivization of a linear space over a division ring, so in these dimensions this definition is no more general than the linear-algebraic one above, but in dimension two there are other projective planes, namely the non-Desarguesian planes, and this definition permits one to define collineations in such projective planes.\n\nFor dimension one, the set of points lying on a single projective line defines a projective space, and the resulting notion of collineation is just any bijection of the set.\n\nFor a projective space of dimension one (a projective line; the projectivization of a vector space of dimension two), all points are collinear, so the collineation group is exactly the symmetric group of the points of the projective line. This is different from the behavior in higher dimensions, and thus one gives a more restrictive definition, specified so that the fundamental theorem of projective geometry holds.\n\nIn this definition, when \"V\" has dimension two, a collineation from \"PG\"(\"V\") to \"PG\"(\"W\") is a map , such that:\nThis last requirement ensures that collineations are all semilinear maps.\n\nThe main examples of collineations are projective linear transformations (also known as homographies) and automorphic collineations. For projective spaces coming from a linear space, the fundamental theorem of projective geometry states that all collineations are a combination of these, as described below.\n\nProjective linear transformations (homographies) are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transformations map planes to planes, so projective linear transformations map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transformations. PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.\n\nAn is a map that, in coordinates, is a field automorphism applied to the coordinates.\n\nIf the geometric dimension of a pappian projective space is at least 2, then every collineation is the product of a homography (a projective linear transformation) and an automorphic collineation. More precisely, the collineation group is the projective semilinear group, which is the semidirect product of homographies by automorphic collineations.\n\nIn particular, the collineations of are exactly the homographies, as R has no nontrivial automorphisms (that is, Gal(R/Q) is trivial).\n\nSuppose \"φ\" is a nonsingular semilinear map from \"V\" to \"W\", with the dimension of \"V\" at least three. Define by saying that for all \"Z\" in \"D\"(\"V\"). As \"φ\" is semilinear, one easily checks that this map is properly defined, and further more, as \"φ\" is not singular, it is bijective. It is obvious now that \"α\" is a collineation. We say that \"α\" is induced by \"φ\".\n\nThe fundamental theorem of projective geometry states the converse:\n\nSuppose \"V\" is a vector space over a field \"K\" with dimension at least three, \"W\" is a vector space over a field \"L\", and \"α\" is a collineation from PG(\"V\") to PG(\"W\"). This implies \"K\" and \"L\" are isomorphic fields, \"V\" and \"W\" have the same dimension, and there is a semilinear map \"φ\" such that \"φ\" induces \"α\".\n\nFor , the collineation group is the projective semilinear group, PΓL – this is PGL, twisted by field automorphisms; formally, the semidirect product , where \"k\" is the prime field for \"K\".\n\nThus for \"K\" a prime field (formula_2 or formula_3), we have , but for \"K\" not a prime field (such as formula_4 for or formula_5), the projective linear group is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group, which can be thought of as \"transformations preserving a projective \"semi\"-linear structure\". Correspondingly, the quotient group corresponds to \"choices of linear structure\", with the identity (base point) being the existing linear structure. Given a projective space without an identification as the projectivization of a linear space, there is no natural isomorphism between the collineation group and PΓL, and the choice of a linear structure (realization as projectivization of a linear space) corresponds to a choice of subgroup , these choices forming a torsor over Gal(\"K\"/\"k\").\n\nThe idea of a line was abstracted to a ternary relation determined by collinearity (points lying on a single line). According to Wilhelm Blaschke it was August Möbius that first abstracted this essence of geometrical transformation:\nContemporary mathematicians view geometry as an incidence structure with an automorphism group consisting of mappings of the underlying space that preserve incidence. Such a mapping permutes the lines of the incidence structure, and the notion of collineation persists.\n\nAs mentioned by Blaschke and Klein, Michel Chasles preferred the term \"homography\" to \"collineation\". A distinction between the terms arose when the distinction was clarified between the real projective plane and the complex projective line. Since there are no non-trivial field automorphisms of the real number field, all the collineations are homographies in the real projective plane., however due to the field automorphism complex conjugation, not all collineations of the complex projective line are homographies. In applications such as computer vision where the underlying field is the real number field, \"homography\" and \"collineation\" can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe operation of taking the complex conjugate in the complex plane amounts to a reflection in the real line. With the notation \"z\" for the conjugate of \"z\", an anti-homography is given by\nThus an anti-homography is the composition of conjugation with an homography, and so is an example of a collineation which is not an homography. For example, geometrically, the mapping formula_7 amounts to circle inversion. The transformations of inversive geometry of the plane are frequently described as the collection of all homographies and anti-homographies of the complex plane.\n\n"}

It holds that practices and norms can be evaluated in terms of:\n\nThe most distinctive of these considerations is the third. As such, Contextual Integrity highlights the importance of privacy not only for individuals, but for society and respective social domains.\n\nThe “contexts” of contextual integrity are social domains, intuitively, health, finance, marketplace, family, civil and political, etc. The five critical parameters that are singled out to describe data transfer operation are:\n\n\nSome illustrations of contextual informational norms in western societies, include:\n\nExamples of data subjects include patient, shopper, investor, or reader. Examples of information senders include a bank, police, advertising network, or a friend. Examples of data recipients include a bank, the police, a friend. Examples of information types include the contents of an email message, the data subject’s demographic information, biographical information, medical information, and financial information. Examples of transmission principles include consent, coerced, stolen, buying, selling, confidentiality, stewardship, acting under the authority of a court with a warrant, and national security.\n\nA key thesis is that assessing the privacy impact of information flows requires the values of all five parameters to be specified. Nissenbaum has found that access control rules not specifying the five parameters are incomplete and can lead to problematic ambiguities.\n\nNissenbaum notes that the some kinds of language can lead one’s analysis astray. For example, when the passive voice is used to describe the movement of data, it allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that there is an active agent performing the data transfer. For example, the sentence “Alice had her identity stolen” allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that someone or something did the actual stealing of Alice’s identity. If we say that “Carol was able to find Bob’s bankruptcy records because they had been placed online”, we are implicitly ignoring the fact that someone or some organization did the actual collection of the bankruptcy records from a court and the placing of those records online.\n\nConsider the norm: “US residents are required by law to file tax returns with the US Internal Revenue Service containing information, such as, name, address, SSN, gross earnings, etc. under conditions of strict confidentiality.”\nData Subject: A US resident\n\nSender: The same US resident\n\nRecipient: The US Internal Revenue Service\n\nInformation type: tax information\n\nTransmission principle: the recipient will hold the information in strict confidentiality.\nGiven this norm, we can evaluate a hypothetical scenario and see if it violates the contextual integrity norm:\n\nHypothetical: “The US Internal Revenue Service agrees to supply Alice’s tax returns to the city newspaper as requested by a journalist at the paper.”\n\nThis hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity because the providing the tax information to the local newspaper would violate the transmission principle under which the information was obtained.\n\nIn 2006 Barth, Datta, Mitchell and Nissenbaum presented a formal language that could be used to reason about the privacy rules in privacy law. They analyzed the privacy provisions of the Grahm Leach Biley act and showed how to translate some of its principles into the formal language.\n\n"}
{"id": "9629286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9629286", "title": "Desensitization (psychology)", "text": "Desensitization (psychology)\n\nIn psychology, desensitization is defined as the diminished emotional responsiveness to a negative, aversive or positive stimulus after repeated exposure to it. It also occurs when an emotional response is repeatedly evoked in situations in which the action tendency that is associated with the emotion proves irrelevant or unnecessary. The process of desensitization was developed by psychologist Mary Cover Jones, and is primarily used to assist individuals in unlearning phobias and anxieties. Joseph Wolpe (1958) developed a method of a hierarchal list of anxiety evoking stimuli in order of intensity, which allows individuals to undergo adaption. Although medication is available for individuals suffering from anxiety, fear or phobias, empirical evidence supports desensitization with high rates of cure, particularly in clients suffering from depression or schizophrenia.\n\nThe hierarchical list is constructed between client and therapist in rank ordered series of steps from the least disturbing to the most disturbing fears or phobias. Secondly the client is taught techniques that produce deep relaxation. It is impossible to feel both anxiety and relaxation at the same time, so easing the client into deep relaxation helps inhibit any feelings of anxiety. Systematic desensitization (a guided reduction in fear, anxiety or aversion) can then be achieved by gradually approaching the feared stimulus while maintaining relaxation. Desensitization works best when individuals are directly exposed to the stimuli and situations they fear so anxiety-evoking stimuli are paired with inhibitory responses. This is carried out either by clients performing in real life situations (known as vivo desensitization), or, if it is not practical to directly act out the steps of hierarchy, by clients observing models performing the feared behaviour (known as vicarious desensitization). Clients slowly move up the hierarchy, repeating performances if necessary, until the last item on the list is performed without fear or anxiety.\n\nAnimals can also be desensitized to their rational or irrational fears. A race horse who fears the starting gate can be desensitized to the fearful elements (the creak of the gate, the starting bell, the enclosed space) one at a time, in small doses or at a distance. Clay et al. (2009) conducted an experiment whereby he allocated rhesus macaques to either a desensitization group or a control group, finding that those in the desensitization group showed a significant reduction in both the rate and duration of fearful behavior. This supports the use of PRT training. Desensitization is commonly used with simple phobias like insect phobia. In addition, desensitization therapy has been shown to be a useful tool in training domesticated dogs. Systematic desensitization used in conjunction with counter-conditioning was shown to reduce problem behaviours in dogs, such as vocalization and property destruction. \n\nDesensitization also refers to the potential for reduced responsiveness to actual violence caused by exposure to violence in the media, although this topic is debated in the scientific literature on the topic. Desensitization may arise from different sources of media, including TV, video games and movies. Some scholars suggest that violence may prime thoughts of hostility, with the possibility of affecting the way we perceive others and interpret their actions. \n\nIt is hypothesized that initial exposure to violence in the media may produce a number of aversive responses such as increased heart rate, fear, discomfort, perspiration and disgust. However, prolonged and repeated exposure to violence in the media may reduce or habituate the initial psychological impact until violent images do not elicit these negative responses. Eventually the observer may become emotionally and cognitively desensitized to media violence. In one experiment, participants who played violent video games showed lower heart rate and galvanic skin response readings, which the authors interpreted as displaying a physiological desensitization to violence. However, other studies have failed to replicate this finding. Some scholars have questioned whether becoming desensitized to media violence specifically transfers to becoming desensitized to real-life violence.\n\n"}

In the case of inanimate objects the word dosing is typical. The term dose titration, referring to stepwise adjustment of doses until a desired level of effect is reached, is common in medicine.\n\nThe word \"dosing\" is very commonly used by engineers in thermal power stations, in water treatment, in any industry where steam is being generated, and in building services for heating and cooling water treatment. Dosing procedures are also in vogue in textile and similar industries where chemical treatment is involved.\n\nCommercial swimming pools also require chemical dosing in order to control pH balance, chlorine level, and other such water quality criteria.

The feeding at all places is done by means of small capacity dosing pumps specially designed for the duty demanded.\n\nIn building services the water quality of various pumped fluid systems, including for heating, cooling, and condensate water, will be regularly checked and topped up with chemicals manually as required to suit the required water quality. Most commonly inhibitors will be added to protect the pipework and components against corrosion, or a biocide will be added to stop the growth of bacteria in lower temperature systems.

Dosing of dry materials is commonly done through Gain-in-Weight dosing or Loss-in-Weight dosing using equipments on load cells.\n\nThe feeding of chemicals in agriculture has also become common due to technology developments. However agricultural dosing is done by means of hand held pressure spray pumps.\n\nSometimes aerial spraying of chemicals by fixed quantities at intervals or dosing is also adopted for agricultural spraying or for atmospheric spraying for eliminating certain types of harmful insects.\n"}
{"id": "56382794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56382794", "title": "Eccentrism", "text": "Eccentrism\n\nEccentrism was an avant-garde artistic movement in the Soviet Union active during the 1920s. In the early 1920s it was a movement in theatre associated with the factory of the eccentric actor, which rejected traditional theatrical acting in favor of a modern and physical performance incorporating shocking stunts, derived from the circus and other popular entertainment. A school of eccentrist cinema emerged from the theatre group in the later 20s. Sergei Eisenstein was briefly associated with the movement. \nIn Russian, the word “eccentric” was used as a term of art for circus performers, referring to the tricks performed for the audience. In 1921 the young directors Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky formed the theatre workshop “factory of the eccentric actor” (Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera, or FEKS), in Petrograd. It was one of a plethora of avant-garde artists groupings blossoming in this period which attempted to respond to the faster paces of modernity within the openings perceived after the 1917 revolution. FEKS in particular advocated “an illogical performance style modeled on the physicality of circus stunts,” as well as on the popularity of American cinema of the period, such as Charlie Chaplin. \n\nThe December 1921 manifesto of the eccentric theater “Ekstsentrism” pronounced: “1) for the actor—from emotion to the machine, from anguish to the trick. The technique—circus…. 2) for the director—a maximum of devices, a record number of inventions, a turbine of rhythms. 3) for the dramatist—a composer of tricks. 4) for the artist—decoration in jumps.” In true Futurist fashion the manifesto demanded the abandonment of the old culture, and was handed out on the streets of St. Petersburg. \n\nIn \"New Worlds, Russian Art and Society\", David Elliott states that “Eccentricism was a logical development from the alogical thought of the futurists. Artists introduced absurd elements or breaks in logic into their work in order to restructure and reorientate reality.” In July 1922 the main participants in FEKS expanded on the Eccentrist manifesto, and cited as parents of the movement, street language, circus posters, negro jazz bands, cinema, the music hall, the circus and boxing. Key to eccentrism in action was “synthesis of movements: acrobatic, gymnastic, balletic, constructivist-mechanical,” to give “the BASIC TEMPO of the epoch.”\n\nIt was not till September 1922 that FEKS put on its first public performance, based loosely on Nikolai Gogol’s \"Wedlock\", but titled “Wedlock (Not from Gogol): A Stunt in Three Acts.” The Playbill promised “Eccentrism presents: operetta, melodrama, farce, movies, circuses, variety, puppetry in a single performance!” According to contemporary reviews, the two main characters, scientists Albert and Einstein, “were played by circus eccentrics Serge and Taurek”, to “the utter delight of the audience.” “Eccentrism was the principle of organization of the entire spectacle,” with the actors joined by a dancer and a crowd of marchers.\n\nIn “The Future of FEKS” of 1923, Sergy Radlov announced that, from this season, “FEKS will carry on work as an independent studio within the Petroproketkul’t” the Petrograd manifestation of the new Soviet Proletkult federation dedicated to revolutionary working class aesthetic production. It was in this form that the group produced the Cocteau-influenced \"Foreign Trade on the Eiffel Tower\" (1923). By then, the group included well-known theatrical figures such as, SG Martinson, FF Knorre, as well as the dancer and silent film actress Z. Tarkhovskaya. \n\nDespite the stated links with the circus, a sympathetic critic, Vladimir Nedobrovo, wrote in 1928 that “the Eccentrism of the FEKS is not the same as the eccentrism of the music hall” and is concerned with opening up stilted perception through “impeded form” and “alienation of the object” from its automatic state, a vision which owed something to Russian Formalist poetics. Yutkevich went further, and claimed its “aim was the final destruction of the bourgeois world.”\n\nThe young Sergi Eisenstein (then associated with the more mechanized aesthetic of Meyerhold’s acting workshop) was introduced to FEKS by Sergi Yutkevich in 1922. He was strongly under its influence when he produced his first major work for the theater, “The Montage of Attractions” (1923), and worked with Tretiakov on “The Wiseman,” shown in the Moscow Proletkult Theatre in 1923. While FEKS cited Chaplin’s cinema as an influence on their theater, and Eisenstein was influenced by FEKS theater in his later films, both took pains to distinguish the methods of fiction film from those of theater, unlike Meyerhold who moved to merge their styles. Viktor Shklovsky wrote of the impossible, unexpected, and “eccentric” effects in Eisenstein’s 1925 film, Strike.\n\nOut of the FEKS theater, a new film-making group was being formed. They were concerned not just with “the selection of memorial moments” in the words of contemporary Russian Formalist critic Viktor Shklovsky, but “a new, non-automatic connection between them.” This paralleled Eisenstein’s ideas of a “montage of attraction.” The motivation behind this was summed up by Shklovsky in 1928: “Eccentrism is a struggle with the monotony of life, a rejection of its traditional conception and presentation.”\n\nHowever, Eisenstein soon broke with eccentrism to theorize his notion of “the attraction” in theatre and film as including, but going beyond, the “stunt” and the “trick,” on their own, in favor of a structure based on the ideological reactions of the audience. Dziga Vertov was also to move beyond eccentrism in his work, declaring in his 1926 “The Factory of Facts” that cinema should be “Not a FEKS (the Leningrad Factory of the Eccentric Actor), nor Eisenstein’s ‘factory of attractions’” but “a factory of facts.” \n\nBetween 1924 and 1929 FEKS produced five films under the banner of eccentricism. At this point, the Soviet Cinema Week reported the FEKS collective as having twenty-five members, including Leonid Trauberg and Grigorii Kozintsev as co-directors, Hungarian communist Evgenii Enei as art director and the important addition of Andrei Moskvin as cinematographer/cameraman. Their films were famous for exaggerated body movements, comedic acting, and extrovert character psychology. The first FEKS film was the 1924 \"Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny\" (The Adventures of an Octoberite) an agitational spectacle featuring a farcical villain and a chase scene set in the cupula of Petrograd’s Saint Isaac’s Cathedral.\n\nIn a following film, \"Chertovo kolesco\" (the Devil’s Wheel, 1926), a love scene unfolds on a switchback in front of a funfair. Kozintsev described their film as based on the idea that “everything must be active.” While the popular funfair background is enticing, and reflects the spirit of the FEKS manifesto, in the film the carnival is seen as a vacation from more serious Bolshevik pursuits of building a new world, and so can be seen as an ideological self-criticism of earlier FEKS fascinations.\n\nThe same could be said of the 1927 film S.V.D. where the “trickster” character served in the plot as a counter revolutionary bad character, questioning the solid identification of the FEKS aesthetic with the eccentric clown. \n\nIn these films, technology was seen as on the side of a progressive modernism, but by FEKS last film, the 1929 \"Novyi Vavilon\" (New Babylon) featuring the uprising and suppression of the Paris Commune, impersonal machinery in the form of guns are on the side of oppression. In form, the sharp focus of \"Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny\" has given way to a diffuse cinematography using smoke, diffusion disks or Vaseline on the lens. The change in attitude towards the machine aesthetic parallels the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, and the film received an unfavorable critical reception.\n\nIn its development from the 1921 manifesto, Eccentrism was faced with many crossroads; the aesthetic traditions of popular theatrical entertainment and the new cinema; silent and sound film, and avant-garde experimentation and socialist realism, all within the quickly changing ideas of the role of art in the 20s. By 1928 film production was effectively subsumed under the control of the state, and the soviet government was increasingly under the bureaucratic control of Joseph Stalin. Eccentrism, as with many of the early Soviet Avant-Garde movements, was not to survive the move to the state-sponsored “Socialist Realism.” \nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Grigory Kozintsev, a founding member of FEKS theatre who had moved to FEKS filmmaking, produced more conventional stagings of Shakespeare at the Pushkin Theater in Leningrad (formerly Petrograd). He later made movies of Don Quixote (1957) and Hamlet (1964).\n"}
{"id": "537821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=537821", "title": "Edgeworth box", "text": "Edgeworth box\n\nIn economics, an Edgeworth box, named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, is a way of representing various distributions of resources. Edgeworth made his presentation in his book \"Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences\", 1881.\nEdgeworth's original two-axis depiction was developed into the now familiar box diagram by Pareto in his 1906 book \"Manual of Political Economy\" and was popularized in a later exposition by Bowley.\nThe modern version of the diagram is commonly referred to as the Edgeworth–Bowley box.\n\nThe Edgeworth box is used frequently in general equilibrium theory. It can aid in representing the competitive equilibrium of a simple system or a range of such outcomes that satisfy economic efficiency. It can also show the difficulty of moving to an efficient outcome in the presence of bilateral monopoly. In the latter case, it serves as a precursor to the bargaining problem of game theory that allows a unique numerical solution.\n\nImagine two people (Octavio and Abby) with a fixed amount of resources between the two of them — say, 10 liters of water and 20 hamburgers. If Abby takes 4 liters of water and 5 hamburgers, then Octavio is left with 6 liters of water and 15 hamburgers. The Edgeworth box is a rectangular diagram with Octavio's origin on one corner (represented by the O) and Abby's origin on the opposite corner (represented by the A). The width of the box is the total amount of one good, and the height is the total amount of the other good. Thus, every possible division of the goods between the two people can be represented as a point in the box.\n\nIndifference curves (derived from each consumer's utility function) can be drawn in the box for both Abby and Octavio. The points on each person's indifference curve represent equally liked combinations of quantities of the two goods for that person. Hence Abby is indifferent between one combination of goods and another on any one of her indifference curves, and the same is true for Octavio. For example, Abby might value 1 liter of water and 13 hamburgers the same as 5 liters of water and 4 hamburgers, or 3 liters and 10 hamburgers. There are an infinite number of such curves that could be drawn among the combinations of goods for each consumer (Octavio or Abby).\n\nWith Octavio's origin (the point representing zero of each good) at the lower left corner of the Edgeworth box and with Abby's origin at the upper right corner, typically Octavio's indifference curves would be convex to his origin and Abby's would be convex to her origin.\n\nWhen an indifference curve for Abby crosses one of the indifference curves for Octavio at more than one point (so the two curves are not tangent to each other), a space in the shape of a lens is created by the crossing of the two curves; any point in the interior of this lens represents an allocation of the two goods between the two people such that both people would be better off, since the point is on an indifference curve farther from both of their respective origins, and thus, each individual achieves a higher utility.\n\nWherever one of these curves for Abby happens to be tangent to a curve of Octavio's, a combination of the two goods is identified that yields both consumers a level of utility that could not be improved for one person by a reallocation without decreasing the utility of the other person. Such a combination of goods is said to be Pareto optimal. The set of tangential points of contact between pairs of indifference curves, if all traced out, will form a trace connecting Octavio's origin (O) to Abby's (A). This curve connecting points O and A, which will not in general be a straight line, is called the Pareto set or the efficient locus, since each point on the curve is Pareto optimal.\n\nThe vocabulary used to describe different objects which are part of the Edgeworth box diverges. The entire Pareto set is sometimes called the contract curve, while Mas-Colell, Winston, and Green (1995) restrict the definition of the contract curve to only those points on the Pareto set which make both Abby and Octavio at least as well off as they are at their initial endowment. Other authors who have a more game theoretical bent, such as Martin Osborne and Ariel Rubinstein (1994), use the term core for the section of the Pareto set which is at least as good for each consumer as the initial endowment.\n\nIn order to calculate the Pareto set, the slope of the indifference curves for both consumers must be calculated at each point. That slope is the negative of the marginal rate of substitution, so since the Pareto set is the set of points where both indifference curves are tangent, it is also the set of points where each consumer's marginal rate of substitution is equal to that of the other person.\n\n\n\n"}

William McGlothlin (1956) and Mukhtar Ali (1977) first discovered this effect after observing the shift in betting patterns at horserace tracks. Mcglothlin and Ali noticed that people are significantly more likely to prefer longshots to conservative bets on the last race of the day. They found that the movement towards longshots, and away from favorites, is so pronounced that some studies show that conservatively betting on the favorite to show (to finish first, second, or third) in the last race is a profitable bet despite the track’s take.\n\nExpected utility hypothesis cannot explain the shift in risk preferences across the day if bettors integrate their wealth because the last race of the day is not fundamentally different from the first. Prospect theory can explain the shift by assuming people open a mental account at the beginning of the day, close it at the end, and hate closing an account in the red.\n\nThe end-of-the-day betting effect is consistent with the risk aversion/risk seeking behaviors associated with prospect theory, which state that people are more likely to be risk averse in the case of gains and risk seeking in the case of losses. Prospect theory claims that people begin with zero daily profit as a reference point and gamble in the domain of losses to break even. Because the racetrack takes a hefty bite out of each dollar, most people are down money when the last races near. Anything below this target is regarded as a loss and triggers risk-seeking behavior in an attempt to break even. Diminishing sensitivity to successive losses means that the cost of the last bet is relatively trivial compared to what has already been spent. Betters refrain from making bets that would not recoup their losses if successful.\n\nJohn and Bob go to the casino to play roulette. After two hours of playing their wives tell them that they must leave after one more spin. John is up $200. Bob is down $320. The end-of-the-day betting effect says that John is more likely to make a low risk bet, such as betting on red or black (1:1 odds), while Bob is more likely to make a bet that can recoup his losses if he is successful, such as betting $10 on 3 single numbers (35:1 odds each).\n"}

It is characterised by a minimalism born of Japanese aesthetics.\n\nDrawing \"ensō\" is a disciplined-creative practice of Japanese ink painting—. The tools and mechanics of drawing the \"ensō\" are the same as those used in traditional Japanese calligraphy: One uses a to apply ink to \"washi\" (a thin Japanese paper).\n\nThe circle may be open or closed. In the former case, the circle is incomplete, allowing for movement and development as well as the perfection of all things. Zen practitioners relate the idea to wabi-sabi, the beauty of imperfection. When the circle is closed, it represents perfection, akin to Plato's perfect form (Plato), the reason why the circle was used for centuries in the construction of cosmological models, see Ptolemy.\n\nUsually, a person draws the \"ensō\" in one fluid, expressive stroke. When drawn according to the style of Japanese calligraphy, the brushstroke is especially swift. Once the \"ensō\" is drawn, one does not change it. It evidences the character of its creator and the context of its creation in a brief, continuous period of time. Drawing \"ensō\" is a spiritual practice that one might perform as often as once per day.\n\nThis spiritual practice of drawing \"ensō\" or writing Japanese calligraphy for self-realization is called . \"Ensō\" exemplifies the various dimensions of the Japanese \"wabi-sabi\" perspective and aesthetic: \"Fukinsei\" (asymmetry, irregularity), \"kanso\" (simplicity), \"koko\" (basic; weathered), \"shizen\" (without pretense; natural), \"yugen\" (subtly profound grace), \"datsuzoku\" (freedom), and \"seijaku\" (tranquility).\n\nIn 1995, Lucent Technologies hired the San Francisco office of Landor Associates, a transnational brand consultancy, to design their brand image. In the design of the logo, Landor colored an image of an ensō red. The designer intended the brushstroke to imply human creativity, and the red to convey urgency. They named it the \"Innovation Ring\". \"Our name and symbol represent the new entrepreneurial spirit and vision of our company\" reads a public relations statement from Lucent. In North America, the logo was widely misunderstood. After years of staying-power and familiarity, the logo became more accepted by industry people in the West (including Lucent's own employees), although it was still not well understood. Nonetheless, soon other logo designers began to be influenced by the work. Lucent stopped using the logo after merging with Alcatel of France to form Alcatel-Lucent.\n\nA variation of the symbol was also used as a logo by Obaku Ltd.. They continue to use an ensō shape as a wristwatch brand.\n\nThinking, an international design and consulting house centred in London, uses an ensō meaning \"Expression\" as one of their four icons, along with icons for science, pattern and vision.\n\nPhilosopher Joseph Campbell's book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, bears this symbol on its cover representing creativity and uninhibited freedom of expression within art/literature.\n\nThe book The Lean Startup uses an enso on the cover. One of the concepts in the approach includes a learning cycle 'Build - Measure - Learn\".\n\nThe design of Apple Campus 2, Apple Inc.'s ring-shaped corporate headquarters, might also have been inspired by the ensō.\n\nAMD uses an ensō in the marketing of its Ryzen processors with the Zen microarchitecture.\n\nMINDBODY prominently features an ensō in its company logo.\n\n"}

The opposite of exploratory thought is confirmatory thought, which is reasoning designed to construct justification supporting a specific point of view.\n\nBoth terms were coined by social psychologist Jennifer Lerner and psychology professor Philip Tetlock in the 2002 book Emerging Perspectives in Judgment and Decision Making. The authors argue that most people, most of the time, make decisions based on gut feelings and poor logic, and reason through issues primarily to provide justification, to themselves and to others, of what they already believe.\n\nLerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to need to justify their position to external parties, and they already know those parties' views, they will tend to adopt a similar position to theirs, and then engage in confirmatory thought with the goal of bolstering their own credibility rather than reaching a good conclusion. However, if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical, people will disengage from thought altogether, and simply assert their personal opinions without justification. Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to external parties who are well-informed, genuinely interested in the truth, and whose views they don't already know. Because those conditions rarely exist, they argue, most people are engaging in confirmatory thought most of the time.\n\nPrinceton statistician John Tukey wrote about selection between confirmation or rejection of existing hypotheses and exploration of new ones, focusing on how practicing statisticians might decide between the two modes of thought at various junctures. Subsequent statisticians, philosophers of science, and organizational psychologists have expanded on the topic.\n\n\n"}

With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing \"living, breathing\" tree homes.\n\nIt would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed (CNC) removable plywood scaffold. Once the plants are interconnected and stable, the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with trees that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to \"train\" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional clay and plaster.\n\nAn old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - pleaching. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living archways, lattices, or screens.; the technique is also named \"Aeroponic culture\". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as Live Oak, Elm and Dogwood. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.\n\nThe Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time. Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the living machine's water treatment system. Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free. All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family. Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure. Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.\n\nAs of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a \"50 per cent\" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.\n\nMain trees suggested to be used are elms and oaks. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.\n\n\n"}

Are ideas we have about fundamental subjects like: the self, mind and body, nature, essence, and identity formed with gendered bias? For instance, feminist metaphysics would ask if Cartesian dualism—the concept of humans having minds separate from our bodies—privileges men or masculinity.\n\nThe famous quote “One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman,” coined by Simone de Beauvoir, can be considered feminist metaphysical critique. De Beauvoir does not deny that some people are born with female body parts, but that those body parts need not imply how one is socially situated. Yet for many societies being in possession of those body parts prescribes social roles, norms, and activities, and the differences are said to be necessary, because they are natural.\n\nSince de Beauvoir many feminists have presented the view that social hierarchies are perpetuated by the fallacy that they are metaphysically \"natural\". In fact, the power that comes from naturalising myths about universal categories, has made feminists wary of accepting that any category at all is \"natural\". And subsequently a response is that any such supposedly \"natural\" category, should not be a basis for how we organize ourselves socially.\n\nIf being a woman is not due to \"situation\", like biology, de Beauvoir claims that it is due to \"instrumentality\" of women's freedom. Critic Judith Butler finds this problematic because de Beauvoir's reasoning, now plots \"situation\" against \"instrumentality\", plays into Cartesian body-freedom dualism.\n\n"}

A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.\n\nA Diffusion Ellipsoid is completely represented by the Diffusion Tensor, D. FA is calculated from the eigenvalues (formula_1) of the diffusion tensor. The eigenvectors formula_2 give the directions in which the ellipsoid has major axes, and the corresponding eigenvalues formula_3 give the magnitude of the peak in that direction.\n\nwith formula_5 being the mean value of the eigenvalues.\n\nAn equivalent formula for FA is\n\nwhich is further equivalent to:\n\nwhere R is the \"normalized\" diffusion tensor:\n\nNote that if all the eigenvalues are equal, which happens for isotropic (spherical) diffusion, as in free water, the FA is . The FA can reach a maximum value of (this rarely happens in real data), in which case D has only one nonzero eigenvalue and the ellipsoid reduces to a line in the direction of that eigenvector. This means that the diffusion is confined to that direction alone.\n\nThis can be visualized with an ellipsoid, which is defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of D. The FA of a sphere is \"0\" since the diffusion is isotropic, and there is equal probability of diffusion in all directions. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Diffusion Tensor give a complete representation of the diffusion process. FA quantifies the pointedness of the ellipsoid, but does not give information about which direction it is pointing to.\n\nNote that the FA of most liquids, including water, is unless the diffusion process is being constrained by structures such as network of fibers. The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the diffusion measurement. If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction on a smaller scale than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated. For example, the brain can be thought of as a fluid permeated by many fibers (nerve axons). However, in most parts the fibers go in all directions, and thus although they constrain the diffusion the FA is . In some regions, such as the corpus callosum the fibers are aligned over a large enough scale (on the order of a mm) for their directions to mostly agree within the resolution element of a magnetic resonance image, and it is these regions that stand out in an FA image. Liquid crystals can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another. When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant.\n\nA drawback of the Diffusion Tensor model is that it can account only for Gaussian diffusion processes, which has been found to be inadequate in accurately representing the true diffusion process in the human brain. Due to this, higher order models using spherical harmonics and Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) have been used to define newer and richer estimates of the anisotropy, called Generalized Fractional Anisotropy. GFA computations use samples of the ODF to evaluate the anisotropy in diffusion. They can also be easily calculated by using the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the ODF model.\n"}

The 2011 film describes Sharp's ideas, and their influence on popular uprisings around the world. Screened in cinemas and television in more than 22 countries it became popular among the Occupy Wall Street Movement.\n\nDirected by British journalist Ruaridh Arrow the film follows the use of Gene Sharp's work across revolutionary groups throughout the world. There is particular focus on Sharp's key text \"From Dictatorship to Democracy\" which has been translated by democracy activists into more than 30 languages and used in revolutions from Serbia and Ukraine to Egypt and Syria. The film describes how Sharp's 198 methods of nonviolent action have inspired and informed uprisings across the globe.\n\nA primary character of the film is Gene Sharp, founder of the Albert Einstein Institution, and a 2009 and 2012 nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Sharp has been a scholar on nonviolent action for more than 50 years, and has been called both the \"Machiavelli of nonviolence\" and the \"Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.\"\nOther main characters include Jamila Raqib, a former Afghan refugee and the Executive Director of the Albert Einstein Institution; Colonel Robert \"Bob\" Helvey; Srđa Popović, leader of Otpor! students group Serbia; Ahmed Maher, leader of April 6 democracy group Egypt; and Ausama Monajed, Syrian activist.\n\nScottish journalist Ruaridh Arrow, who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, explained that he first learned about Gene Sharp's work as a student, and then heard that Sharp's booklets were turning up on the sites of many revolutions. But Sharp himself remained largely unknown. In explaining his motivation to make the film, Arrow stated that\n\nThe film was privately funded by Ruaridh Arrow and additional funding was raised through the US crowdfunding site Kickstarter. The film raised $57,342 in just under 4 weeks making it the most successful British crowdfunded film currently completed. Several high-profile figures are credited by the producers with supporting the crowdfunding project, including director Richard Linklater and actress Miriam Margolyes. Completion funding was donated by US art collector James Otis who sold the largest collection of Gandhi possessions including Gandhi's iconic glasses and sandals in 2009. Otis stated that he was selling the items to help fund nonviolent struggle projects and is described as the Executive Producer of the film.\n\nPrincipal photography began in May 2009 with Director of Photography Philip Bloom in Boston. Interview sequences were shot on Sony EX1 cameras with a Letus 35mm lens adapter and the Canon 5dmk2 DSLR camera. Ruaridh Arrow travelled to Egypt to film the Egyptian revolution in February 2011 but his camera equipment was seized by Egyptian secret police on landing and key sequences had to be filmed on the iphone4. Arrow reported live from Tahrir Square for BBC News during this period.\n\nThe premiere was held in Boston on 18 September 2011, the day after the Occupy Wall St protests officially began in New York. The film received a standing ovation and won Best Documentary and the Mass Impact award at Boston Film Festival, and went on to be screened by Occupy camps across the US and Europe including the Bank of Ideas in London.\n\nThe European premiere was held at Raindance Film Festival in London where the film received the award for Best Documentary. Subsequent awards have included Best Documentary Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival 2011, Special Jury Award One World Film Festival Ottawa, Jury Award Bellingham Human Rights Film Festival and Best Film, Barcelona Human Rights Film Festival. The film won the Scottish BAFTA for new talent in April 2012 and shortlisted for a Grierson Award in July 2012.\n\n\"How to Start a Revolution\" was picked up for distribution by TVF International in the UK and 7th Art Releasing in the US. The film has reportedly been translated into nine languages, including Japanese and Russian. The Albert Einstein Institute has reported that the film has been shown internationally on several television stations.\n\nThe film has received a positive critical reception. It received four stars in \"Time Out London\", \"a reminder of the importance of intellectual thought to the everyday\". The Huffington Post said it was a \"vital conversation starter and educational tool in a world awash with violence\" and the UK's Daily Telegraph described it as a \"World conquering Documentary\". \"The New York Times\" called it a \"noble documentary\" but criticised the absence of historical context of nonviolent struggles pre-dating Sharp. \"Variety\" described the film as \"straightforward\", \"informative\", and \"with potential to be updated as world events unfold\", stating it \"should have a long shelf life\". Negative references have been made to the use of dramatic music during certain sequences.\n\n\"How to Start a Revolution\" was released on 18 September 2011 the day after the first Occupy protests in Wall St, New York. The film was described as the unofficial film of the Occupy movement and shown in camps across the US and Europe. It was one of a number of high-profile events held in London's Bank of Ideas along with a concert by British band Radiohead.\n\nIn 2012 following the Mexican general election one of the country's largest newspapers reported that protestors were circulating a pirated Spanish translation of \"How to Start a Revolution\" which had gone viral in the country. The translation was viewed over half a million times in the space of three days. Reports have also been published citing the airing of the film on Spanish television concurrent with widespread discussion of Sharp's work in the Spanish anti-austerity 15-M Movement.\n\nThe academic premiere was hosted by the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School on 11 October 2011, and In February 2012, \"How to Start a Revolution\" was screened to an audience of MP's and Lords in the UK Houses of Parliament by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Conflict Issues (APPGCI) which was attended by Gene Sharp.\n\nA film about the making of \"How to Start a Revolution\", entitled \"Road to Revolution\", was screened in January 2012 by Current TV in the UK.\n\nOn January 22, 2017, after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the PBS America channel screened \"How to Start a Revolution\" immediately after a \"Frontline\" investigation into his election.\n\nIn 2012 \"How to Start a Revolution\" was among the first \"Touch Documentaries\" to be released using the Apple iPad platform. The film was integrated into the platform along with four of Gene Sharp's books in several languages, including \"From Dictatorship to Democracy\", and several of Sharp's lectures. The app is supplemented by analysis and satellite mapping which is offered up to the viewer while watching the film. A \"Revolution Monitor\" is also included which fuses Google Earth maps with Twitter displaying tweets and YouTube links from revolutionary groups and individuals when countries of interest are touched by the viewer.\nA review by The Peace & Collaborative Network described the app as \"simply a must-have among peace studies scholars, those actively working to start or reorganize revolutions, or anyone who is interested in the logistics, history, and outcomes of nonviolent revolutions\" \nThe \"How to Start a Revolution\" touch documentary was shortlisted for the International Best Digital Media award in the One World Media Awards 2013 \n\n"}
{"id": "14337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14337", "title": "Human sexual activity", "text": "Human sexual activity\n\nHuman sexual activity, human sexual practice or human sexual behaviour is the manner in which humans experience and express their sexuality. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., masturbation) to acts with another person (e.g., sexual intercourse, non-penetrative sex, oral sex, etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in sexual arousal and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the sex life of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners (courtship and display behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, foreplay or BDSM). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, emotional, behavioural and biological aspects; these include personal bonding, sharing emotions and the physiology of the reproductive system, sex drive, sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while premarital and extramarital sex are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the norms of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most jurisdictions are sexual assault and sexual activity with a person below the local age of consent.\n\nSexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called autoeroticism) such as masturbation, or two or more people such as vaginal sex, anal sex, oral sex or mutual masturbation. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as group sex. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of dildos, vibrators, anal beads, and other sex toys, though these devices can also be used with a partner.\n\nSexual activity can be classified into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, casual sex partners or anonymous. Sexual activity can be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, paraphilia, or BDSM activities. Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.\n\nSexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called sexual assault or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to social norms or generally accepted sexual morals.\n\nIn evolutionary psychology and behavioral ecology, human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain mates. Mating strategies overlap with reproductive strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see life history theory).\n\nRelative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of marriage. Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term intimate relationship, marriage, casual relationship, or friendship. The human desire for companionship is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the sex drive. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the courtship process and the process of forming an interpersonal relationship. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see animal sexual behavior).\n\nThe physiological responses during sexual stimulation are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.\n\nSexual dysfunction is the inability to react emotionally or physically to sexual stimulation in a way projected of the average healthy person; it can affect different stages in the sexual response cycles, which are desire, excitement and orgasm. In the media, sexual dysfunction is often associated with men, but in actuality, it is more commonly observed in females (43 percent) than males (31 percent).\n\nSexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age. It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.\n\nPeople engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: \"physical attraction\", as a \"means to an end\", to increase \"emotional connection\", and to \"alleviate insecurity\".\n\nMost people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the arousal of their sexuality, especially if they can achieve orgasm. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from foreplay and flirting, and from fetish or BDSM activities, or other erotic activities. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the sexual desire generated by a person to whom they feel sexual attraction; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of casual or social sex. At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.\n\nA person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of conception. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten sexual tension, attraction and interest.\n\nIt has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. Joan Roughgarden, in her book \"Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,\" postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.\n\nResearch has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with self-determination theory. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership. Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation. The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation. This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.\n\nAccording to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being. While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment. When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship. Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females. It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons. Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity. Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.\n\nThe frequency of sexual activity might range from zero (sexual abstinence) to 15 or 20 times a week. In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week. It is generally recognized that postmenopausal women experience declines in frequency of sexual intercourse and that average frequency of intercourse declines with age. According to the Kinsey Institute, the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).\n\nThe age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See Prevalence of virginity.) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the sexualization of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of virginity or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the age of consent.\n\nA 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.\n\nResearch on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity. Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred. Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.\n\nAlthough opinions differ, others suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex. According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction. In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17. Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.\n\nSexual activity is an innately physiological function, but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: unwanted pregnancy, contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.\n\nAny sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy. To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use contraception, such as birth control pills, a condom, diaphragms, spermicides, hormonal contraception or sterilization. The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.\n\nSexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's bodily fluids or mucosal membranes carries the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. People may not be able to detect that their sexual partner has one or more STIs, for example if they are asymptomatic (show no symptoms). The risk of STIs can be reduced by safe sex practices, such as using condoms. Both partners may opt be tested for STIs before engaging in sex. The exchange of body fluids is not necessary to contract an infestation of crab lice. Crab lice typically are found attached to hair in the pubic area but sometimes are found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, chest, armpits, etc.). Pubic lice infestations (pthiriasis) are spread through direct contact with someone who is infested with the louse.\n\nSome STIs can also be contracted by using IV drug needles after their use by an infected person, as well as through childbirth or breastfeeding.\n\nTypically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.\n\nHeterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on social policy, marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. Sodomy laws were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing sexual abuse, committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.\n\nDifferent-sex sexual practices may be monogamous, serially monogamous, or polyamorous, and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, abstinent or autoerotic (including masturbation). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.\n\nHomosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors. Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.\n\nIt is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being closeted (hiding their sexuality in \"the closet\"). \"Closet case\" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called \"coming out of the closet\" in the case of voluntary disclosure or \"outing\" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called \"men on the DL\" or \"down-low\"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. Men who have sex with men, as well as women who have sex with women, or men on the \"down-low\" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.\n\nPeople who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as situational homosexuality). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their sexual identity. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners – tribadism (generally vulva-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its \"scissoring\" position) and frot (generally penis-to-penis rubbing).\n\nPeople who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual. People who have a distinct but not exclusive preference for one sex/gender over the other may also identify themselves as bisexual. Like gay and lesbian individuals, bisexual people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being closeted.\n\nPansexuality (also referred to as omnisexuality) may or may not be subsumed under bisexuality, with some sources stating that bisexuality encompasses sexual or romantic attraction to all gender identities. Pansexuality is characterized by the potential for aesthetic attraction, romantic love, or sexual desire towards people without regard for their gender identity or biological sex. Some pansexuals suggest that they are gender-blind; that gender and sex are insignificant or irrelevant in determining whether they will be sexually attracted to others. As defined in the \"Oxford English Dictionary,\" pansexuality \"encompasses all kinds of sexuality; not limited or inhibited in sexual choice with regards to gender or practice\".\n\nAlex Comfort and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational. The development of the contraceptive pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).\n\nMost world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed moral codes covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of extramarital sexual relations, it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. Hedonism is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only intrinsic good.\n\nHuman sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as sexual morality (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).\n\nSexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, fidelity and consent. Some activities, known as sex crimes in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include sodomy law and adult-adult incest).\n\nSome people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, online chat rooms, or, advertising in select media.\n\nSwinging, on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a committed relationship engaging in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity. The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a sex club, also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a strip club).\n\nSome people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the adult industry include phone sex operators, strip clubs, and pornography.\n\nSocial gender roles can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the World Health Organization states that, \"Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence.\" Some societies, such as those where the concepts of family honor and female chastity are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as honor killings and female genital mutilation.\n\nThe relation between gender equality and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining sexual and reproductive health, as stated by the UN International Conference on Population and Development Program of Action:\n\nBDSM is a variety of erotic practices or roleplaying involving bondage, dominance and submission, sadomasochism, and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on self-identification and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, extreme body modification enthusiasts, animal players, latex or rubber aficionados, and others.\n\nB/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind. D/S means \"dominant and submissive.\" A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control. S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.\n\nUnlike the usual \"power neutral\" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of informed consent of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or tops, while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or bottoms.\n\nIndividuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a \"dom\" for a man or a woman. Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term \"Domme\". Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken. Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as \"switches\". The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.\n\nIn a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,\nuse suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s). The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to psychopathology. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM. It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.\n\nIn a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.\n\nThere are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.\n\nMost societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called sexual assault, and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex (age of consent) are frequently the subject of debate, as is adolescent sexual behavior in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.\n\nMany locales have laws that limit or prohibit same-sex sexual activity.\n\nIn the West, sex before marriage is not illegal. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex. In many Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, Oman, Mauritania, United Arab Emirates, Sudan, Yemen, any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal. Those found guilty, especially women, may be forced to wed the sexual partner, publicly beaten, or stoned to death. In many African and native tribes, sexual activity is not viewed as a privilege or right of a married couple, but rather as the unification of bodies and is thus not frowned upon.\n\nOther studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage. Adolescents were asked how they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being. Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic. Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.\n\nThe laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity. This age of consent is typically between 14 and 18 years, but laws vary. In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age. As a result, those above the set age of consent may still be considered unable to legally consent due to mental immaturity. Many jurisdictions regard any sexual activity by an adult involving a child as child sexual abuse.\n\nAge of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.\n\nMost jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called incestuous.\n\nNon-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of sexual abuse, as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as frotteurism, telephone scatophilia (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual exhibitionism and voyeurism (known as \"indecent exposure\" and \"peeping tom\" respectively).\n\nPeople sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) \"john.\" Prostitution is one of the branches of the sex industry. The legal status of prostitution varies from country to country, from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100 billion. Prostitution is sometimes referred to as \"the world's oldest profession\". Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or forced by pimps.\n\nSurvival sex is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when homeless or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other basic needs, or for drugs. The term is used by sex trade and poverty researchers and aid workers.\n\n"}

Proponents claim that repeated practice of this particular formula of mental imagery translates to improved coordination in dance and in movement in general \"based on the idea that imagery can improve skeletal alignment and posture through the re-patterning of neuromuscular pathways in the absence of overt movement\". Although there is some evidence that rehearsal-style mental imagery may benefit performance in sports, there is currently insufficient data to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of metaphorical imagery as only personal and experimental research has been conducted on ideokinesis and there are reasons to believe it may be contraindicated as a relaxation technique.\n\nIdeokinesis was originally developed as a form of mental practice for injured dancers, but some dance schools have integrated it into a standard somatics protocol for all dancers because it is thought to optimize motor control and performance by using periods of rest constructively. Known among followers as \"the Work\", \"ideokinesis\" is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms, such as \"mental practice\", \"mental rehearsal\", \"visuomotor behavior rehearsal\", \"covert rehearsal\", and \"ideokinetic facilitation\", among others.\n\nMabel Todd conceived the ideokinesis approach; Barbara Clark and Lulu Sweigard, and others contributed to its early evolution; later, André Bernard, Irene Dowd, Erick Hawkins, Pamela Matt, Eric Franklin and others lent their influence.\n\nSweigard borrowed the word \"ideokinesis\", composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology. Ideokinesis can be translated roughly as \"the image or thought as facilitator of movement\".\n"}
{"id": "16568692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16568692", "title": "Immanent critique", "text": "Immanent critique\n\nImmanent critique is a method of discussing culture which aims to locate contradictions in society's rules and systems. This method is used in the study of cultural forms in philosophy and the social sciences and humanities. It may be contrasted with \"transcendental\" Kantian critical philosophy. Immanent critique further aims to contextualize not only the object of its investigation, but also the ideological basis of that object: both the object and the category to which it belongs are shown to be products of a historical process. Immanent critique has its roots in the dialectic of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the criticisms by Karl Marx. Today it is strongly associated with the critical theorists such as Theodor Adorno as well as literary theorists such as Fredric Jameson who, in his seminal work The Political Unconscious, explored the idea of an immanent analysis of texts to argue the primacy of political interpretation. Roy Bhaskar has advocated it as one of the key methodological elements of critical realism.\n\nThe purpose of immanent critique is the detection of societal contradictions which suggest possibilities for emancipatory social change. It considers ideas’ role in shaping society, with focus on future emancipatory change. An immanent critique of a value is a discussion of the principles (overt or implicit) the value proposes. It highlights the gaps between what something stands for and what is being done in actual terms. Immanent critique tries to find contradictions and indirectly provide alternatives, without constructing an entirely new theory.\n\nQuoting Marx, Robert J. Antonio writes in the \"British Journal of Sociology\",\n\nAccording to David Harvey, formerly of the University of Nevada, Reno,\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25659940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25659940", "title": "Inhibitory control", "text": "Inhibitory control\n\nInhibitory control, also known as response inhibition, is a cognitive process  and more specifically, an executive function – that permits an individual to inhibit their impulses and natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral responses to stimuli ( prepotent responses) in order to select a more appropriate behavior that is consistent with completing their goals. Self-control is an important aspect of inhibitory control. For example, successfully suppressing the natural behavioral response to eat cake when one is craving it while dieting requires the use of inhibitory control.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus are known to regulate inhibitory control cognition. Inhibitory control is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In healthy adults and ADHD individuals, inhibitory control improves over the short term with low (therapeutic) doses of methylphenidate or amphetamine. Inhibitory control may also be improved over the long-term via consistent aerobic exercise.\n\nAn inhibitory control test is a neuropsychological test that measures an individual's ability to override their natural, habitual, or dominant behavioral response to a stimulus in order to implement more adaptive behaviors. Some of the neuropsychological tests that measure inhibitory control include the Stroop task, go/no-go task, Simon task, Flanker task, antisaccade tasks, delay of gratification tasks, and stop-signal tasks.\n\nFemales tend to have a greater basal capacity to exert inhibitory control over undesired or habitual behaviors and respond differently to modulatory environmental contextual factors relative to males. For example, listening to music tends to significantly improve the rate of response inhibition in females, but reduce the rate of response inhibition in males.\n\nJenkins & Berthier (2014) conducted a study on working memory and inhibitory response in toddlers. The toddlers that participated were between the ages of two and three years of age. Thirty six children were recruited, twenty of them were males and sixteen were females; most of the children were closer to 3 years of age (34 months). The way these subjects were recruited was via telephone calls and letters from birth state records that were found. The purpose of this study was to determine which type of test helped increase memory retention in toddlers. There were four types of test, the door task, three boxes-stationary task, three boxes scrambled, and the three pegs task. Three of these tests were working memory tasks and one was an inhibitory/cognitive control test. The first test that was given was the door task; in this task children were asked to sit in front of an item or electronic device that consisted of a pathway where balls could be rolled down into different slots. A barrier was included to mislead the child and test the memory of what slot the ball went into. They were then instructed to search or point at where the hidden ball had landed. The second test was called three boxes stationary task. This test asked the participants to select a box of their choice that contained certain treats. The child kept getting distracted as the researcher pulled away the boxes and brought them back to his/her attention to choose the right box where the treat was in; along with this test the child was provided with feedback. The third test was similar to the second test; the only difference was that the boxes were scrambled. The last test consisted of a three peg task, this measured inhibitory control, in this test children were asked to identify pegs. The results of this study found that the inhibitory control test was the most effective in allowing the child to remember things. The improvements were found due to an increase in attention and reaction time. Most of these tasks involved analyzing a part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.\n\n"}
{"id": "28264928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28264928", "title": "Initiation (Theosophy)", "text": "Initiation (Theosophy)\n\nInitiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on Earth can progress upward through. Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they reincarnate, although evil acts may cause bad karma which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed that when souls have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached enlightenment and have no further need to reincarnate. At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy. This concept was developed by both C. W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.\nAccording to C.W. Leadbeater, \"Initiation\" is a process by which \"we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect.\" According to Alice A. Bailey, \"Initiation\" is the \"process of undergoing an expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness\" It is believed by Theosophists that all souls that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to reincarnate that do not elect to become pratyeka buddhas and go directly into Nirvana gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond. \n\nThe concept of \"Initiation\" is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions loosely based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as \"Ascension\". \n\nThe first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of Jesus.\n\nAccording to Martin Euser, “Theosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the eternal return ]. The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reimbodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.”\n\nThe vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation).\n\nAccording to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the physical body. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their \"Individualized \"I AM\" Presence\", the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement.\n\nAlice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the astral body. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nAn individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed clairvoyance and clairaudience. According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation.\n\nAn individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an Arhat (Pali) or a Paramahamsa (Sanskrit). \n\nAt this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's past lives, and one also has various minor siddhis capable of affecting one's immediate environment. \n\nSymbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the \"crucifixion\" initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation.\n\nHaving reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the \"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\". One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a \"Master of the Ancient Wisdom\". These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature \"the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man\" are:\n\nThe fifth initiation, called the \"resurrection\", comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom and in the Ascended Master Teachings as Ascended masters. \n\nSiddhis at this level include the ability to teleport and bilocate moderate\ndistances and levitate within a localized area. \n\nAccording to C. W. Leadbeater, Alice Bailey and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all—subtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. \n\nOf these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme. \n\nC. W. Leadbeater named a Master called Master Jupiter who lives in India that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level. \n\nAlice A. Bailey identified as Masters the Master P., who is said to help \"St. Germain\" bring about the Age of Aquarius in the Americas, and two different \"English Masters\" (English Master #1 and English Master #2), one of which is said to have inspired the labor movement. In addition to these three, she identified the three \"Lords of Liberation\" – (Lord of Liberation #1, Lord of Liberation #2, and Lord of Liberation #3). According to Alice A. Bailey, the three \"Lords of Liberation\" formulated the slogan \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\". Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three \"Lords of Karma\" (Lord of Karma #1, Lord of Karma #2, and Lord of Karma #3). These three beings are said to live in Shamballah and help \"Sanat Kumara\" decide where and when souls are going to incarnate in their next life. \n\nBenjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001—he stated that there is a Master in Moscow and a Master in Tokyo, but did not give their personal names. \n\nForty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name.\n\nGuy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new \"Ascended Masters\" at this level; however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists. Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as Confucius, Lord Ling, Lady Master Magda, Pallas Athena, Lanello, Kwan Yin, the Great Divine Director, Padre Pio, Godfre and his \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) Lady Master Lotus, and many dozens more.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Master Jupiter\" is referred to as Chananda.\n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, \"Sanat Kumara\" has a grandson named Master Cha Ara who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, therefore meaning he is functioning at the fifth level.\n\nThe Chohans (Lords) of the Seven Rays – Morya (1st Ray), Master Koot Hoomi (2nd Ray), Paul the Venetian (3rd Ray), Serapis Bey (4th Ray), Master Hilarion (5th Ray), Master Jesus (6th Ray), and the Master Rakoczi (7th Ray) – are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and communications director Djwal Khul is another, making a total of eight at this level. \n\nAll of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings. In the Ascended Master Teachings, \"Master Rakoczi\" is referred to as St. Germain.\n\nSiddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. \n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the Lady Master Nada (a \"lady\" Master recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.\n\nThe seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the Bodhisattava (Buddhism) or the Avatar (Hinduism). The Maitreya or \"World Teacher\" (known as Krishna by Hindus, the Christ by Christians, Maitreya by Buddhists, Messiah by the Jews, the Iman Mahdi by Muslims, and the Peshotan by the Zoroastrians) is at this level. At this level also are said to be the Chakshusha Manu, the Vaivasvatu Manu and the Maha Chohan, thus making a total of four beings at this level.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Chakshusha Manu\" is referred to as Lord Himalaya.\n\nAccording to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the solar system. Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a flying saucer. Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of invulnerability such that they would not be affected by a bullet fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. \n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level. \n\nLevel eight is the level of the Buddha.\n\nAt this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are The Three Pratyeka Buddhas (the task of these three Buddhas is to focus the Seven Rays from \"Sanat Kumara\" through \"Djwal Khul\" to the chohans of the Seven Rays). Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays.\n\nAlice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by telepathy. According to Theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett, beings at this level can freely roam both in interplanetary space and in nearby interstellar space in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings. In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras. Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star Sirius. \n\nThis makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy.\n\nIn the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with \"Sanat Kumara\".\n\nThe three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the Five Dhyani Buddhas of mainstream Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the twelve rays.\n\nLevel nine is the \"Lord of the World\": Sanat Kumara – \"The Eternal Youth\" and \"The Ancient of Days\", the Nordic alien that is believed by Theosophists to be the \"Lord of the World\", i.e., the governing deity of Earth.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level. He stated that Sanat Kumara's \"consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe. In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields \"Fohat\" [i.e. beams composed of \"bubbles in space\" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objects] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system].\" Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include omniscience regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, materialization of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby planetary systems. \n\nAccording to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) named Lady Master Venus who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named Lady Master Meta born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation.\n\nThe tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the Planetary Logos, also called the Spirit of the Earth, and specifically denoted as the Planetary Logos of Earth. In order to reach the status of a \"Planetary Logos\", this being would have had to have been a high level \"Planetary Deva\" in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the creation of the world. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the \"Planetary Logos\" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and Sanat Kumara, in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity. Since the formulation in the early 1970s by James Lovelock of the Gaia hypothesis, many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the Gaia philosophy, nowadays simply refer to the \"Planetary Logos of Earth\" as Gaia, the New Age version of what in many religions is called the Earth mother..\n\nIn the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the Avatar of Synthesis. Its job is to transmit the seven rays from the heart of the sun through the \"seven spirits before the [solar] throne\" to all the life waves of the solar system. According to Benjamin Creme, the \"Avatar of Synthesis\" is functioning at the \"17th level of initiation\". In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called Ray-O-Light. The only master above all these levels is the Christ.\n\nThe Solar Logos itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level. The \"Solar Logos\", the Sun God in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings Helios and his \"twin flame\" (celestial wife) Vesta, the \"God and Goddess of this solar system\", in the Ascended Master Teachings. \n\nPerhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the \"Solar Logos\" would be the Galactic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Galactic Logos\" is personified as the cosmic being Averran.\n\nC.W. Leadbeater stated, \"The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also. They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end.\"\n\nThe number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the Cosmos, because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the stars with \"stellar logoi\" and all the galaxies with \"galactic logoi\", plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder. If Alan Guth's inflation theory, which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the observable universe (itself 93,000,000,000 light years in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the large scale structures of the cosmos before reaching the level of the Cosmic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the \"Cosmic Logos\" is personified as the cosmic beings Alpha and Omega. \n\nIf the concept of the Multiverse is true, then other hierarchies exist in other Universes. It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the Universal Logos has created many other cosmoses besides our own.\n\nMusic\n\n\n"}

What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains (alternatively Is Google Making Us Stoopid?) is a magazine article by technology writer Nicholas G. Carr, and is highly critical of the Internet's effect on cognition. It was published in the July/August 2008 edition of \"The Atlantic\" magazine as a six-page cover story. Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in \"\", a book published by W. W. Norton in June 2010.\n\nThe essay was extensively discussed in the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine \"Edge\", several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.\n\nWhile long-term psychological and neurological studies have yet to yield definitive results justifying Carr's argument, a few studies have provided glimpses into the changing cognitive habits of Internet users. A UCLA study led some to wonder whether a breadth of brain activity—which was shown to occur while users performed Internet searches in the study's functional MRI scans—actually facilitated reading and cognition or possibly overburdened the mind; and what quality of thought could be determined by the additional presence of brain activity in regions known to control decision-making and complex reasoning skills.\n\nPrior to the publication of Carr's \"Atlantic\" essay, critics had long been concerned about the potential for electronic media to supplant literary reading. In 1994, American academic Sven Birkerts published a book titled \"The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age\", consisting of a collection of essays that declaimed against the declining influence of literary culture—the tastes in literature that are favored by a social group—with a central premise among the essays asserting that alternative delivery formats for the book are inferior to the paper incarnation. Birkerts was spurred to write the book after his experience with a class he taught in the fall of 1992, where the students had little appreciation for the literature he had assigned them, stemming from, in his opinion, their inaptitude for the variety of skills involved in deep reading. In \"Perseus Unbound\", an essay from the book, Birkerts presented several reservations toward the application of interactive technologies to educational instruction, cautioning that the \"long-term cognitive effects of these new processes of data absorption\" were unknown and that they could yield \"an expansion of the short-term memory banks and a correlative atrophying of long-term memory\".\n\nIn 2007, developmental psychologist Maryanne Wolf took up the cause of defending reading and print culture in her book \"Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain\", approaching the subject matter from a scientific angle in contrast to Birkerts' cultural-historical angle. A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet's potential impact on reading in her book; however, in essays published concurrent with the book's release she elaborated upon her worries. In an essay in \"The Boston Globe\", Wolf expressed her grave concern that the development of knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere \"decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes\", and cautioned that the web's \"immediacy and volume of information should not be confused with true knowledge\". In an essay published by Powell's Books, Wolf contended that some of the reading brain's strengths could be lost in future generations \"if children are not taught first to read, and to think deeply about their reading, and only then to e-read\". Preferring to maintain an academic perspective, Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study.\n\nIn Carr's 2008 book \"\", the material in the final chapter, \"iGod\", provided a basis for his later \"Atlantic\" magazine article titled \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\" The inspiration to write \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\" came from the difficulties Carr found he had in remaining engaged with not only books he had to read but even books that he found very interesting. This is sometimes called deep reading, a term coined by academic Sven Birkerts in his book \"The Gutenberg Elegies\" and later defined by developmental psychologist Maryanne Wolf with an added cognitive connotation.\n\nAt the start of the essay, Carr says that his recent difficulties with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending a lot of time on the Internet. He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation. He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 University College London study titled \"Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future\" which suggests the emergence of new types of reading. He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages. Carr raises the point that unlike 'speech, which is an innate ability' hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words. He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies. Carr further draws on Wolf's work, particularly her 2007 book \"Proust and the Squid\", to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and alphabet-based scripts. Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.\n\nCarr begins his argument by reasoning how the capacity to concentrate may be weakened by regular Internet usage. He mentions a historical example involving Friedrich Nietzsche's usage of a typewriter, a fairly new technology in the 1880s. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler, Nietzsche's prose style changed when he started using a typewriter, which he had adopted because of his developing difficulty with writing by hand due to failing eyesight. Carr proceeds to explain that scientific research in the field of neuroplasticity as of 2008 has demonstrated that the brain's neural circuitry can in fact be rewired. In the humanities, sociologist Daniel Bell coined the term \"intellectual technologies\" to describe those technologies that extend the brain's cognitive faculties, and Carr states that he believes that the human brain adopts the qualities of these intellectual technologies. In discussing the mechanical clock, Carr deliberates upon the benefits and losses that are characteristic of new technologies. Then, Carr ventures that the cognitive impact of the Internet may be far more encompassing than any other previous intellectual technology because the Internet is gradually performing the services of most intellectual technologies, thus replacing them. Carr finally contends that the prevalent style of presentation for much of the Internet's content may significantly hinder the capacity to concentrate due to the many distractions that often surround the Internet's content, in the form of ads and obtrusive notifications. Additionally, he claims that these detrimental effects on concentration are compounded by traditional media because they are gradually adopting a style of presentation for their content that mimics the Internet, in order to remain competitive as consumer expectations change.\n\nCarr also theorizes that the capacity to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain of much of the painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.\n\nFinally, Carr places his skepticism in a historical context, reflecting upon how previous detractors of technological advances have fared. While often correct, Carr points out that skepticisms such as Socrates' concerns about written language and the 15th-century Venetian editor Hieronimo Squarciafico's concerns about printed works failed to anticipate the benefits that these technologies might hold for human knowledge. As an afterthought, a 2005 essay by playwright Richard Foreman is excerpted for its lament of the waning of the \"highly educated and articulate personality\".\n\nCarr's essay was widely discussed in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer Bill Thompson observed that Carr's argument had \"succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate\", Damon Darlin of \"The New York Times\" quipped that even though \"[everyone] has been talking about [the] article in \"The Atlantic\" magazine\", only \"[s]ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr.\" The controversial online responses to Carr's essay were, according to \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Steve Johnson, partly the outcome of the essay's title \"Is Google Making Us Stupid?\", a question that the article proper doesn't actually pose and that he believed was \"perfect fodder for a 'don't-be-ridiculous' blog post\"; Johnson challenged his readers to carefully consider their online responses in the interest of raising the quality of debate.\n\nMany critics discussed the merits of Carr's essay at great length in forums set up formally for this purpose at online hubs such as the Britannica Blog and publisher John Brockman's online scientific magazine \"Edge\", where the roster of names quickly took on the semblance of a Who's Who of the day's Internet critics. Calling it \"the great digital literacy debate\", British-American entrepreneur and author Andrew Keen judged the victor to be the American reader, who was blessed with a wide range of compelling writing from \"all of America's most articulate Internet luminaries\".\n\nBook critic Scott Esposito pointed out that Chinese characters are incorrectly described as ideograms in Carr's essay, an error that he believed undermined the essay's argument. The myth that Chinese script is ideographic had been effectively debunked in scholar John DeFrancis' 1984 book \"\"; DeFrancis classifies Chinese as a logosyllabic writing system. Carr acknowledged that there was a debate over the terminology of 'ideogram', but in a response to Esposito he explained that he had \"decided to use the common term\" and quoted \"The Oxford American Dictionary\" to demonstrate that they likewise define Chinese characters as instances of ideograms.\n\nWriter and activist Seth Finkelstein noted that predictably several critics would label Carr's argument as a Luddite one, and he was not to be disappointed when one critic later maintained that Carr's \"contrarian stance [was] slowly forcing him into a caricature of Luddism\". Then, journalist David Wolman, in a \"Wired\" magazine piece, described as \"moronic\" the assumption that the web \"hurts us more than it helps\", a statement that was preceded by an overview of the many technologies that had been historically denounced; Wolman concluded that the solution was \"better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor so that people can distinguish knowledge from garbage\".\n\nSeveral prominent scientists working in the field of neuroscience supported Carr's argument as scientifically plausible. James Olds, a professor of computational neuroscience, who directs the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study at George Mason University, was quoted in Carr's essay for his expertise, and upon the essay's publication Olds wrote a letter to the editor of \"The Atlantic\" in which he reiterated that the brain was \"very plastic\" — referring to the changes that occur in the organization of the brain as a result of experience. It was Olds' opinion that given the brain's plasticity it was \"not such a long stretch to Carr's meme\". One of the pioneers in neuroplasticity research, Michael Merzenich, later added his own comment to the discussion, stating that he had given a talk at Google in 2008 in which he had asked the audience the same question that Carr asked in his essay. Merzenich believed that there was \"absolutely no question that our brains are engaged less directly and more shallowly in the synthesis of information, when we use research strategies that are all about 'efficiency', 'secondary (and out-of-context) referencing', and 'once over, lightly'\". Another neuroscientist, Gary Small, director of UCLA's Memory & Aging Research Center, wrote a letter to the editor of \"The Atlantic\" in which he stated that he believed that \"brains are developing circuitry for online social networking and are adapting to a new multitasking technology culture\".\n\nIn the media, there were many testimonials and refutations given by journalists for the first part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for concentration; treatments of the second part of Carr's argument regarding the capacity for contemplation, were, however, far rarer. Although columnist Andrew Sullivan noted that he had little leisure time at his disposal for contemplation compared with when he grew up, the anecdotes provided by journalists that indicated a deficiency in the capacity to contemplate were described only in the context of third parties, such as columnist Margaret Wente's anecdote about how one consultant had found a growing tendency in her clients to provide ill-considered descriptions for their technical problems.\n\nColumnist Leonard Pitts of \"The Miami Herald\" described his difficulty sitting down to read a book, in which he felt like he \"was getting away with something, like when you slip out of the office to catch a matinee\". Technology evangelist Jon Udell admitted that, in his \"retreats\" from the Internet, he sometimes struggled to settle into \"books, particularly fiction, and particularly in printed form\". He found portable long-form audio to be \"transformative\", however, because he can easily achieve \"sustained attention\", which makes him optimistic about the potential to \"reactivate ancient traditions, like oral storytelling, and rediscover their powerful neural effects\".\n\nAlso writing in \"The Atlantic\", a year after Carr, the futurist Jamais Cascio argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr as a form of attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: \"The trouble isn’t that we have too much information at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution.\" Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. Pew Research used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition \"Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid\". In \"The Googlisation of Everything\", Vaidhyanathan tended to side with Carr. However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes. In \"From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg\" Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.\n\nFirmly contesting Carr's argument, journalist John Battelle praised the virtues of the web: \"[W]hen I am deep in search for knowledge on the web, jumping from link to link, reading deeply in one moment, skimming hundreds of links the next, when I am pulling back to formulate and reformulate queries and devouring new connections as quickly as Google and the Web can serve them up, when I am performing bricolage in real time over the course of hours, I am 'feeling' my brain light up, I and 'feeling' like I'm getting smarter\". Web journalist Scott Rosenberg reported that his reading habits are the same as they were when he \"was a teenager plowing [his] way through a shelf of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky\". In book critic Scott Esposito's view, \"responsible adults\" have always had to deal with distractions, and, in his own case, he claimed to remain \"fully able to turn down the noise\" and read deeply.\n\nIn critiquing the rise of Internet-based computing, the philosophical question of whether or not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine \"Edge\", Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an \"autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us\". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book \"The Pentagon of Power\", in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that \"there is only one axis of choice\" which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in \"The Big Switch\" that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will \"always be lonely and in the end futile\"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.\n\nThe selection of one particular quote in Carr's essay from pathologist Bruce Friedman, a member of the faculty of the University of Michigan Medical School, who commented on a developing difficulty reading books and long essays and specifically the novel \"War and Peace\", was criticized for having a bias toward narrative literature. The quote failed to represent other types of literature, such as technical and scientific literature, which had, in contrast, become much more accessible and widely read with the advent of the Internet. At the Britannica Blog, writer Clay Shirky pugnaciously observed that \"War and Peace\" was \"too long, and not so interesting\", further stating that \"it would be hard to argue that the last ten years have seen a decrease in either the availability or comprehension of material on scientific or technical subjects\". Shirky's comments on \"War and Peace\" were derided by several of his peers as verging on philistinism. In Shirky's defense, inventor W. Daniel Hillis asserted that, although books \"were created to serve a purpose\", that \"same purpose can often be served by better means\". While Hillis considered the book to be \"a fine and admirable device\", he imagined that clay tablets and scrolls of papyrus, in their time, \"had charms of their own\". \"Wired\" magazine editor Kevin Kelly believed that the idea that \"the book is the apex of human culture\" should be resisted. And Birkerts differentiated online reading from literary reading, stating that in the latter the reader is directed within themselves and enters \"an environment that is nothing at all like the open-ended information zone that is cyberspace\" in which he feels psychologically fragmented.\n\nSeveral critics theorized about the effects of the shift from scarcity to abundance of written material in the media as a result of the technologies introduced by the Internet. This shift was examined for its potential to lead individuals to a superficial comprehension of many subjects rather than a deep comprehension of just a few subjects. According to Shirky, an individual's ability to concentrate had been facilitated by the \"relatively empty environment\" which had ceased to exist when the wide availability of the web proliferated new media. Although Shirky acknowledged that the unprecedented quantity of written material available on the web might occasion a sacrifice of the cultural importance of many works, he believed that the solution was \"to help make the sacrifice worth it\". In direct contrast, Sven Birkerts argued that \"some deep comprehension of our inheritance [was] essential\", and called for \"some consensus vision among those shapers of what our society and culture might be shaped toward\", warning against allowing the commercial marketplace to dictate the future standing of traditionally important cultural works. While Carr found solace in Shirky's conceit that \"new forms of expression\" might emerge to suit the Internet, he considered this conceit to be one of faith rather than reason. In a later response, Shirky continued to expound upon his theme that \"technologies that make writing abundant always require new social structures to accompany them\", explaining that Gutenberg's printing press led to an abundance of cheap books which were met by \"a host of inventions large and small\", such as the separation of fiction from non-fiction, the recognition of talents, the listing of concepts by indexes, and the practice of noting editions.\n\nAs a result of the vast stores of information made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a \"Wall Street Journal\" business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long \"the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how to find all of these facts and many others\". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was \"like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties\". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.\n\nIn the essay, Carr introduces the discussion of the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is said to have been influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book \"Gramophone, Film, Typewriter\", Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes. Esposito believed that \"the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it.\" In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was \"pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly\". In \"The New York Times\" it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.\n\nAlthough there was a consensus in the scientific community about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain in a way that was beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists there was a belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called \"Fast ForWord\" that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning disabilities in children. Feedback on \"Fast ForWord\" showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of \"Fast ForWord\" specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, \"Fast ForWord\"-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.\n\nIn Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science fiction film \"\", astronaut David Bowman slowly disassembles the mind of an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. He felt as if someone was \"tinkering with [his] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory\". HAL had also been used as a metaphor for the \"ultimate search engine\" in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book \"The Big Switch\", and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft \"Discovery One\" could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile \"like clockwork\" and the age of the computer engendering the simile \"like computers\". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.\n\nAfter the publication of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book \"The Big Switch\" that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops under the influence of the Internet.\n\nScholars at University College London conducted a study titled \"Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future\", the results of which suggested that students' research habits tended towards skimming and scanning rather than in-depth reading. The study provoked serious reflection among educators about the implications for educational instruction.\n\nIn October 2008, new insights into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks their brain activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book \"iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind\", co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.\n\nWhile one set of critics and bloggers used the UCLA study to dismiss the argument raised in Carr's essay, another set took a closer look at the conclusions that could be drawn from the study concerning the effects of Internet usage. Among the reflections concerning the possible interpretations of the UCLA study were whether greater breadth of brain activity while using the Internet in comparison with reading a book improved or impaired the quality of a reading session; and whether the decision-making and complex reasoning skills that are apparently involved in Internet search, according to the study, suggest a high quality of thought or simply the use of puzzle solving skills. Thomas Claburn, in \"InformationWeek\", observed that the study's findings regarding the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage were inconclusive and stated that \"it will take time before it's clear whether we should mourn the old ways, celebrate the new, or learn to stop worrying and love the Net\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the Age of Enlightenment and the concurrent Jewish enlightenment. Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against Jews where they resided. Before the emancipation, most Jews were isolated in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve integration in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European civil society as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the Russian Empire and France. Some European Jews turned to Socialism, others to Jewish nationalism: Zionism.\n\nJews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. Since the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215, Christian Europeans required Jews and Muslims to wear special clothing, such as the Judenhut and the yellow badge for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths (see Oath More Judaico). Jews were not allowed to vote, where vote existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and Spain after the expulsion in the late 15th century.\n\nIn contrast, in 1264, the Polish Prince Boleslaw the Pious issued the \"Statute of Kalisz\" – The General Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, an unprecedented document in medieval history of Europe that allows Jews personal freedom, legal autonomy and separate tribunal for criminal matters as well as safeguards against forced baptism and blood libel. The Charter was ratified again by subsequent Polish Kings: Casimir the Great of Poland in 1334, Casimir IV of Poland in 1453, and Sigismund I the Old of Poland in 1539. After massive expulsions of Jews from Western Europe (England, France, Germany, and Spain), they found a refuge in the lands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the Jagiellon Era Poland became the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts warranting Jewish safety and religious freedom from the 13th century contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe, especially following the Black Death of 1348–1349, blamed by some in the West on Jews themselves. Large parts of Poland suffered relatively little from the outbreak, while the Jewish immigration brought valuable manpower and skills to the rising state. The greatest increase in Jewish numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the Polish population.\n\nThe rabbinate was the highest goal of many young Jewish men, and the study of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible) and the Talmud was the means to obtain the coveted position.\n\nJewish involvement in gentile society began during the Age of Enlightenment. Haskalah, the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated \"coming out of the ghetto\", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.\n\nOn September 28, 1791, revolutionary France became the second country of the world, after Poland 500 years earlier, to emancipate its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality which the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews. Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with gentiles. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see Napoleon and the Jews). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that Jewish political movements would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain, Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.\n\nThe early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights. Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process. The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as Heinrich Heine, Johann Jacoby, Gabriel Riesser, Berr Isaac Berr, and Lionel Nathan Rothschild, worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.\n\nIn 1781, the Prussian civil servant Christian Wilhelm Dohm published the famous script \"Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden\". Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. Till this day, it is called the \"Bible of Jewish emancipation\".\n\nIn the face of persistent anti-Jewish incidents and blood libels, such as the Damascus affair of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The Board of Deputies of British Jews under Moses Montefiore, the Central Consistory in Paris, and the \"Alliance Israelite Universelle\" all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.\n\nJewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the German Confederation following the decisions of the Congress of Vienna. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, Johann Smidt - unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties - altered the text from \"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them in the confederal states\", by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: \"The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them by the confederal states.\" A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary Wilhelm von Humboldt and the Austrian Klemens von Metternich promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.\n\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848, Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the Frankfurt Parliament (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as Prussia (1812), Württemberg (1828), Electorate of Hesse (1833), and Hanover (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws which sought to oppress the Jews. Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new \"de facto\", though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the North German Federation on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly united Germany in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by Nazi Germany from 1933 through World War II.\n\nIn some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of \"changing\" the Jews \"for the better.\"\n\nThe emancipation disrupted the relationship the Jews had with their religion, which could not govern any longer all the actions in their lives. Many considered a practice of Judaism more closely to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish fellow citizens. The emancipation in France, Italy, Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos and contribute, as a result of the Haskalah, to the development of Reform during the 19th century. The emancipation contributed moreover to the assimilation of Jews and sometimes to their cultural disappearance when Jews merged through marriage in the surrounding society. It was not until Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch defined a modern vision of orthodox Judaism, enabling orthodox Jews to participate fully in a society. Ultimately, emancipation immersed the Jews into a new culture. In doing so, Jews were able to not only see themselves as members of a religious sect, but also as citizens within society. At the same time, however, some were concerned that leaders within the Jewish movement were seeking to position Judaism with an approach catered toward a new Western civilization.\n\n\n\n"}

It also means 'attachment to worldly objects' or to 'the yellowish-red garments worn by monks'.\n\nSadananda defines \"Kasaya\" as attachment to worldly objects, the failure of the mental state to rest on the Absolute, owing to the numbness brought on by impressions due to attachment even when there is no torpidity or distraction (Vedantasara) (Sl.212). In Vedanta, the word Kasaya denotes metaphorically a rigid state of mind hardened by one's own inclinations and passions.\n\nRishi Gautama Nodha (Rig Veda I.58.3) describes the Jiva in the following words:-\n\nAnd, Rishi Kumaro Yamayana (Rig Veda X.135.6) in the following mantra explains\n\nthat the Paramatman \"universal Soul\" is the primordial existence, remaining throughout creation, omnipresent, even as the Jivatman \"individual Soul\" dons a body and experiences bondage to \"material objectives\" and duality or (unknowing) of that omniprescence \n\nIt is the \"Jiva\", who by its actions, attracts to itself the \"pudgalas\" (the tendencies that keep an individual re-incarnating), which results in its bondage; all that one enjoys or suffers from are the products of karmas, good or bad.\n\nGaudapada (Gaudapada Karika III.44-45) warns that the seeker after truth should not linger on the bliss of Savikalpa Samadhi because that enjoyment (\"rasavada\"), after \"Laya\", \"Vikshepa\" and \"Kasaya\", is the fourth kind of obstacle in the path to Nirvikalpa Samadhi; one should be unattached through \"viveka\", discrimination. Attachment is a weakness of the mind as it is not easily disciplined to withdraw from the enjoyment and related effects arising out of desire. He explains: as in dreams where the mind vibrates with dual aspects, so too in the waking state these aspects seem to be all that there is but when the state of\"nirati\", dissolution of the mind is achieved, duality is no longer perceived. The conduct of the mind in deep sleep (when it loses itself) is not like its conduct in the controlled state (when it does not lose itself), and\n\nTorpidity or \"Laya\" (लय) is overwhelm of the senses and the mental state, falling asleep unable to maintain awareness of the Absolute; and distraction or \"Vikshepa\" (विक्षेप) is through failing to be able to rest the mental state on the Absolute, resting it on other things.\n\nPatanjali (Yoga Sutras II.2) – समाधि – भवनार्थः क्लेश – तनूकरनार्थश्च – assures that by cultivating the power of concentration the obstacles - which cause all suffering - in the way of enlightenment - can be removed. The obstacles he refers to are the negative effects of ignorance, egoism, attachment, aversion and the desire to cling to life. And, as regards the enjoyment of bliss attained coinciding the gain of non-conceptual knowledge Sankara advocating the understanding of the depth-meaning (lakshyatha) of the Mahavakya Tat Twam Asi, states\n\n– which statement means that owing to the conditioning (vikshepa) in the Jiva, the individual can experience only the \"awareness\" and not the \"bliss\" aspect of Brahman.\n"}

The term has historically been associated with lean manufacturing and Six Sigma (or Lean Six Sigma) due to lean principles being popularized by Toyota in the automobile manufacturing industry and subsequently the electronics and internet software industries.\n\nPrinciples for lean enterprise derive from lean manufacturing and Six Sigma principles:\n\nThere are five principles, originating from lean manufacturing, outlined by James Womack and Daniel Jones\n\n\nThere are key lean enterprise principles originating from Lean Six Sigma principles. These principles focus on eliminating 8 varieties of waste (Muda) and form the acronym DOWNTIME:\n\n\nThese 8 varieties of waste are derivative from the original 7 wastes as defined in the Toyota Production System. They are:\n\nThe 8th waste of non-utilized talent was not recognized until post-Americanization of the Toyota Production System.\n\nThe lean startup principles, developed from 2008 from lean manufacturing, also now contribute to our understanding of lean enterprise:\n\n\nHenry Ford developed a process called assembly line production. This is a manufacturing process in which parts are added as the assembly moves from work station to work station where parts are added in sequence until final assembly is produced.\n\nAlfred Sloan of General Motors further developed the concept of assembly line production by building a process called mass production that allowed scale and variety. This process enabled large amounts of standardized products to run through assembly lines while still being able to produce more variety and compete against Ford's single offering.\n\nKiichiro Toyoda studied the Ford production system and adapted the process in order to have smaller production quantities. He built a production system called Just-in-Time Manufacturing for Toyota along with Taichi Ohno. It's worth noting too that kaizen, the process of continuous improvement, was developed in the 1950s by Eiji Toyoda along with the Toyota Production System.\n\nNew innovations in lean enterprise moved away from machine technology to electronic technology.\n\nAnother development was management techniques from Motorola commonly referred to as Six Sigma. This management technique was built off of mass production principles with more focus on minimizing variability. Applying Six Sigma principles led to reduced cycle time, reduced pollution, reduced costs, increased customer satisfaction, and increased profits.\n\nNew innovations in lean enterprise moved away from electronic manufacturing to internet and software technology. Before, during, and after the dot-com bubble, internet and software enterprises originally did not place emphasis on lean enterprise principles for efficient usage and allocation of capital and labor due to accessible funds from venture capital and capital markets. The idea of \"build it and they will come\" became common practice as a result.\n\nAfter the dot-com bubble, inspired by the Agile Manifesto, internet and software companies began operating under agile software development practices such as Extreme programming. Along with the agile software movement, companies (especially startups) applied both lean enterprise and agile software principles together in order to develop new products or even new companies more efficiently and based on validated customer demand. Very early practices of lean enterprise and agile software principles was commonly referred to as lean startup.\n\nAfter 2010, more and more enterprises are adopting this new branch of lean enterprise (lean startup) since it provides principles and methodologies for non-internet enterprises to enter in new markets or offer goods and services in new form factors with less time, labor, and capital. For internet and software enterprises (by tradition), the Lean startup variant of lean enterprise enabled them to remain competitive with new technologies and services that are rapidly coming out to market without exclusively resorting to mergers and acquisitions, and being able to retain internal innovation ecosystem competency.\n\n"}

However, the idea did not become well known until the late 18th century. The term \"perpetual peace\" became acknowledged when German philosopher Immanuel Kant published his 1795 essay \"\".\n\nPerpetual peace has had significant influence upon modern politics. Perpetual peace has been the foundation for peace and conflict studies, a relatively newly laid field which started in Europe around the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe other modern plans for a perpetual peace descend from Kant's 1795 essay, \"\" (\"\"). In this essay, Kant described his proposed peace program. Perpetual peace is arguably seen as the starting point of contemporary liberal thought.\n\n\"Perpetual Peace\" is structured in two parts. The Preliminary Articles described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:\n\nThree Definitive Articles would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace:\n\nKant's essay in some ways resembles modern democratic peace theory, though it also differs significantly from it. He speaks of republican (\"Republikanisch\") states (rather than of democratic ones), which he defines to have representative governments, in which the legislature is separated from the executive. He does not discuss universal suffrage, which is vital to modern democracy and quite important to some modern theorists; his commentators dispute whether it is implied by his language. Most importantly, he does not regard republican governments as sufficient by themselves to produce peace: freedom of travel, though not necessarily migration, (hospitality); and a league of nations are necessary to consciously enact his six-point program.\n\nUnlike some modern theorists, Kant claims not that republics will be at peace only with each other, but are more pacific than other forms of government in general.\n\nThe general idea that popular and responsible governments would be more inclined to promote peace and commerce became one current in the stream of European thought and political practice. It was one element of the American policy of George Canning and the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. It was also represented in the liberal internationalism of Woodrow Wilson, George Creel, and H.G. Wells, although other planks in Kant's platform had even more influence. In the next generation, Kant's program was represented by the Four Freedoms and the United Nations.\n\nKant's essay is a three-legged stool (besides the preliminary disarmament). Various projects for perpetual peace have relied on one leg – either claiming that it is sufficient to produce peace, or that it will create the other two.\n\nIn 1909, Norman Angell relied only upon the second leg, arguing that modern commerce made war necessarily unprofitable, even for the technically victorious country, and therefore the possibility of successful war was \"The Great Illusion\". James Mill had described the British Empire as outdoor relief for the upper classes; Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism made modern states inherently peaceful and opposed to conquest and imperialism, which economically favored the old aristocratic elites.\n\nThis theory has been well developed in recent years. Mansfield and Pollins, writing in the Journal of Conflict Resolution, summarize a large body of empirical work which, for the most part, supports the thesis. There are various exceptions and qualifications which seem to limit the circumstances under which economic interdependence results in conflict reduction. On the other hand, moving beyond economic interdependence to the issue of economic freedom within states, Erik Gartzke has found empirical evidence that economic freedom (as measured by the Fraser Institute Economic Freedom Index) is about fifty times more effective than democracy in reducing violent conflict.\n\nThe third leg is the old idea that a confederation of peaceable princes could produce a perpetual peace. Kant had distinguished his league from a universal state; Clarence Streit proposed, in \"Union Now\" (1938), a union of the democratic states modelled after the Constitution of the United States. He argued that trade and the peaceable ways of democracy would keep this Union perpetual, and counted on the combined power of the Union to deter the Axis from war.\n\nIn \"A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace\", part IV of \"Principles of International Law\" (1786–89), Jeremy Bentham proposed that disarmament, arbitration, and the renunciation of colonies would produce perpetual peace, thus relying merely on Kant's preliminary articles and on none of the three main points; contrary to the modern theorists, he relied on public opinion, even against the absolute monarchy in Sweden.\n\nSince 2008, the Perpetual Peace Project—a partnership between the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNIC), the International Peace Institute (IPI), the United Nations University, Slought Foundation, and Syracuse University—is engaging Kant's essay in an ongoing philosophical and curatorial initiative that is conceptualized around ultimately \"re-writing\" Kant's 1795 treatise, as well as a republication of the essay. Thinking through the ideas behind the project and its links to Kant, Gregg Lambert, Aaron Levy, and Martin Rauchbauer rely on the secret article contained in the second supplement which \"is detached from the main body of the public treatise that outlines the preliminary and definitive articles, and offered as a secret pact\". They draw on the ironic tone of Kant's writing to argue that the treatise performs the idea that the conditions for peace are best considered silently. Secretly, that is, statesmen and politicians can take the idea of peace seriously, since it will never be associated with them. As such, the project brings together theorists and practitioners, such as diplomats, policy experts, philosophers, and artists, in order to revisit 21st century prospects for international peace through Kant's essay, in order to \"change people's minds, get them to take the idea seriously, start to imagine what it would be like to live in a peaceful society\". The Perpetual Peace Project finds its public form in symposia, exhibitions, lectures, as well as a feature film.\n\n\n"}

The aim is to force compliance by causing distress, which could be in the form of pain, anxiety, psychological disturbance, immobilization, or disorientation.\n\nOne form of this torture involves forcibly injecting a person with addictive drugs in order to induce physical dependence. The drug is then withdrawn, and, once the person is in withdrawal, the interrogation is started. If the person complies with the torturer's demands, the drug is reintroduced, relieving the person's withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn Brazil, pharmacological torture involved the injection of alcohol into the tongue in the 1940s, the injection of ether into the scrotum in the 1960s, and drugs were used to cause strong contractions in the 1970s. Also, muscle relaxants were used to minimize muscular rigidity and bone fractures caused by electric shock in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1960s, prisoners were reportedly given drugs to make them talk in their sleep.\n\nIn 2013, leaked video footage shot inside South Africa's Mangaung Prison showed a prisoner with no record of mental illness being forcibly injected, apparently with anti-psychotic drugs.

Other alleged uses of pharmacological torture included:\n\nIn the United States, in a series of hearings in the fall and winter of 1977, Congressional committees drew forth disclosure of project MKULTRA, which was most active between 1953 and 1966 and conducted experiments that included the CIA agents administering LSD and Truth Serum to soldiers, citizens, and foreign nationals without their knowledge or consent. Activities of MKULTRA resulted in at least one death, that of Frank Olson, an army scientist who was given LSD without his knowledge, and committed suicide as a result of his experience.\n\nIn 1953 Harold Blauer died in a New York State psychiatric institute after doctors there administered 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine derivatives to him without his consent, as part of a 1950s secret program run by the US army that tested chemical warfare agents on US citizens.\n\nIn Uruguay, people have allegedly been paralyzed using curare derivatives.\n\nIn the television series, \"24\", a fictional drug called \"hyoscine-pentothal\" was used to inflict pain on characters during interrogations in several episodes.\n\n"}

The term \"ternary ring\" often means a planar ternary ring, but it can also simply mean a ternary system.\n\nA planar ternary ring is a structure formula_1 where formula_2 is a set containing at least two distinct elements, called 0 and 1, and formula_6 is a mapping which satisfies these five axioms:\n\nWhen formula_2 is finite, the third and fifth axioms are equivalent in the presence of the fourth.\n\nNo other pair (0', 1') in formula_19 can be found such that formula_20 still satisfies the first two axioms.\n\nDefine formula_21. The structure formula_22 is a loop with identity element 0.\n\nDefine formula_23. The set formula_24 is closed under this multiplication. The structure formula_25 is also a loop, with identity element 1.\n\nA planar ternary ring formula_1 is said to be \"linear\" if formula_27.\nFor example, the planar ternary ring associated to a quasifield is (by construction) linear.\n\nGiven a planar ternary ring formula_1, one can construct a projective plane with point set \"P\" and line set \"L\" as follows: (Note that formula_29 is an extra symbol not in formula_2.)\n\nLet\n\nThen define, formula_33, the incidence relation formula_34 in this way:\n\nEvery projective plane can be constructed in this way, starting with an appropriate planar ternary ring. However, two nonisomorphic planar ternary rings can lead to the construction of isomorphic projective planes.\n\nConversely, given any projective plane π, by choosing four points, labelled \"o\", \"e\", \"u\", and \"v\", no three of which lie on the same line, coordinates can be introduced in π so that these special points are given the coordinates: \"o\" = (0,0), \"e\" = (1,1), \"v\" = (formula_29) and \"u\" = (0). The ternary operation is now defined on the coordinate symbols (except formula_29) by \"y\" = T(\"x\",\"a\",\"b\") if and only if the point (\"x\",\"y\") lies on the line which joins (\"a\") with (0,\"b\"). The axioms defining a projective plane are used to show that this gives a planar ternary ring. \n\nLinearity of the PTR is equivalent to a geometric condition holding in the associated projective plane.\n\nPTR's which satisfy additional algebraic conditions are given other names. These names are not uniformly applied in the literature. The following listing of names and properties is taken from .\nA linear PTR whose additive loop is associative (and thus a group), is called a cartesian group. In a cartesian group, the mappings\n\nformula_46, and\nformula_47\n\nmust be permutations whenever formula_48. Since cartesian groups are groups under addition, we revert to using a simple \"+\" for the additive operation.\n\nA quasifield is a cartesian group satisfying the right distributive law:\nformula_49.\nAddition in any quasifield is commutative.\n\nA semifield is a quasifield which also satisfies the left distributive law:\nformula_50\n\nA planar nearfield is a quasifield whose multiplicative loop is associative (and hence a group). Not all nearfields are planar nearfields.\n\n"}
{"id": "513895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513895", "title": "Rebus", "text": "Rebus\n\nA rebus () is a puzzle device which combines the use of illustrated pictures with individual letters to depict words and/or phrases. For example: the word ‘been’ might be depicted by a \"rebus\" showing an illustrated bumblebee next to a plus sign (+) and the letter \"n\". It was a favorite form of heraldic expression used in the Middle Ages to denote surnames.\n\nFor example, in its basic form, three salmon (fish) are used to denote the surname \"Salmon\". A more sophisticated example was the rebus of Bishop Walter Lyhart (d.1472) of Norwich, consisting of a stag (or hart) lying down in a conventional representation of water.\n\nThe composition alludes to the name, profession or personal characteristics of the bearer, and speaks to the beholder \"Non verbis, sed rebus\", which Latin expression signifies \"not by words but by things\" (\"res, rei\" (f), a thing, object, matter; \"rebus\" being ablative plural).\n\nRebuses are used extensively as a form of heraldic expression as a hint to the name of the bearer; they are not synonymous with canting arms. A man might have a rebus as a personal identification device entirely separate from his armorials, canting or otherwise. For example, Sir Richard Weston (d.1541) bore as arms: \"Ermine, on a chief azure five bezants\", whilst his rebus, displayed many times in terracotta plaques on the walls of his mansion Sutton Place, Surrey, was a \"tun\" or barrel, used to designate the last syllable of his surname.\n\nAn example of canting arms proper are those of the Borough of Congleton in Cheshire consisting of a conger eel, a lion (in Latin, \"leo\") and a tun (barrel). This word sequence \"conger-leo-tun\" enunciates the town's name.\nSimilarly, the coat of arms of St. Ignatius Loyola contains wolves (in Spanish, \"lobo\") and a kettle (\"olla\"), said by some (probably incorrectly) to be a rebus for \"Loyola\". The arms of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon feature bows and lions.\n\nA modern example of the rebus used as a form of word play is:\nBy extension, it also uses the positioning of words or parts of words in relation to each other to convey a hidden meaning, for example:\n\nA rebus made up solely of letters (such as \"CU\" for \"See you\") is known as a gramogram, grammagram, or letteral word. This concept is sometimes extended to include numbers (as in \"Q8\" for \"Kuwait\", or \"8\" for \"ate\").. Rebuses are sometimes used in crossword puzzles, with multiple letters or a symbol fitting into a single square.\n\nThe term \"rebus\" also refers to the use of a pictogram to represent a syllabic sound. This adapts pictograms into phonograms. A precursor to the development of the alphabet, this process represents one of the most important developments of writing. Fully developed hieroglyphs read in rebus fashion were in use at Abydos in Egypt as early as 3400 BCE.\n\nThe writing of correspondence in rebus form became popular in the 18th century and continued into the 19th century. Lewis Carroll wrote the children he befriended picture-puzzle rebus letters, nonsense letters, and looking-glass letters, which had to be held in front of a mirror to be read. Rebus letters served either as a sort of code or simply as a pastime.\n\nIn linguistics, the rebus principle is the use of existing symbols, such as pictograms, purely for their sounds regardless of their meaning, to represent new words. Many ancient writing systems used the rebus principle to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to represent with pictograms. An example that illustrates the Rebus principle is the representation of the sentence \"I can see you\" by using the pictographs of \"eye—can—sea—ewe.\"\n\nSome linguists believe that the Chinese developed their writing system according to the rebus principle, and Egyptian hieroglyphs sometimes used a similar system. A famous rebus statue of Ramses II uses three hieroglyphs to compose his name: Horus (as Ra), for \"Ra\"; the child, \"mes\"; and the sedge plant (stalk held in left hand), \"su\"; the name Ra-mes-su is then formed.\n\nFreud posited that the rebus was the basis for uncovering the latent content of the dream. He wrote, \"A dream is a picture puzzle of this sort and our predecessors in the\nfield of dream interpretation have made the mistake of treating the rebus as a pictorial composition: and as such it has seemed to them\nnonsensical and worthless.\"\n\nCanada\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nIndia\n\n\n\nIn Japan, the rebus known as was immensely popular during the Edo period. A piece by ukiyo-e artist Kunisada was \"Actor Puzzles\" (\"Yakusha hanjimono\") that featured rebuses.\n\nToday the most often seen of these symbols is a picture of a sickle, a circle, and the letter , read as , interpreted as , the old-fashioned form of . This is known as the , and dates to circa 1700, being used in kabuki since circa 1815.\n\nKabuki actors would wear \"yukata\" and other clothing whose pictorial design, in rebus, represented their Yagō \"guild names\", and would distribute tenugui cloth with their rebused names as well. The practice was not restricted to the acting profession and was undertaken by townsfolk of various walks of life. There were also pictorial calendars called that represented the Japanese calendar in rebus so it could be \"read\" by the illiterate.\n\nToday a number of abstract examples following certain conventions are occasionally used for names, primarily for corporate logos or product logos and incorporating some characters of the name, as in a monogram; see Japanese rebus monogram. The most familiar example globally is the logo for Yamasa soy sauce, which is a ∧ with a サ under it. This is read as \"Yama,\" for (symbolized by the ∧) + .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55968776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55968776", "title": "Reciprocal causation", "text": "Reciprocal causation\n\nIn biology, reciprocal causation arises when developing organisms are both \"products\" of evolution as well as \"causes\" of evolution. Formally, reciprocal causation exists when process A is a cause of process B and, subsequently, process B is a cause of process A, with this feedback potentially repeated. Some researchers, particularly advocates of the extended evolutionary synthesis, promote the view that causation in biological systems is inherently reciprocal.\n\nHarvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr (1961) suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, ‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’. Ultimate causes (e.g. natural selection) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. physiology) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:\n“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”\nMayr, 1980\nThere has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate dichotomy within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the proximate-ultimate distinction implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:\n“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”\nWest-Eberhard, 2003\nMayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: genotypes cause phenotypes (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in environments cause changes in organisms (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization. (see also ) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. \n\nReciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary evolutionary biology, including sexual selection theory, coevolution, habitat selection, and frequency-dependent selection. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a peacock’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen mate choice decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.\n\nReciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The extended evolutionary synthesis emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental plasticity, or epigenetic inheritance) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. niche construction), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to natural selection of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of adaptive evolution. This goes beyond the recognition that ontogenetic processes can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.\n\nAcceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology), niche construction, cultural evolution, human cooperation, and the evolution of language. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions. Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.\n"}

The aim is to reduce the amount of waste generated, therefore reducing the need for landfill space and also extracting maximum value from waste. Resource recovery delays the need to use raw materials in the manufacturing process. Materials found in municipal solid waste can be used to make new products. Plastic, paper, aluminium, glass and metal are examples of where value can be found in waste.\n\nResource recovery goes further than just the management of waste. Life-cycle analysis (LCA) can be used to compare the resource recovery potential of different treatment technologies. Improvements to administration, source separation and collection, reuse and recycling are important. For example, organic materials can be treated with anaerobic digestion and turned into energy, compost or fertilizer.\n\nResource recovery can also be an aim in the context of sanitation. Here, the term refers to approaches to recover the resources that are contained in wastewater and human excreta (urine and feces). The term \"toilet resources\" has come into use recently. Those resources include: nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), organic matter, energy and water. This concept is also referred to as ecological sanitation. Separation of waste flows can help make resource recovery simpler. Examples include keeping urine separate from feces (as in urine diversion toilets) and keeping greywater and blackwater separate in municipal wastewater systems.\n\nRecycling is a resource recovery practice that refers to the collection and reuse of disposed materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, or sorted directly from mixed waste streams.\n\nThe most common consumer products recycled include aluminium such as beverage cans, copper such as wire, steel food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, polyethylene and PET bottles, glass bottles and jars, paperboard cartons, newspapers, magazines and light paper, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.\n\nPVC, LDPE, PP, and PS (see resin identification code) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.\n\nThe type of recycling material accepted varies by city and country. Each city and country have different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.\n\nValuable resources can be recovered from wastewater, sewage sludge, fecal sludge and human excreta. These include water, energy, and fertilizing nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, as well as micro-nutrients such as sulphur and organic matter. There is also increasing interest for recovering other raw materials from wastewater, such as bioplastics and metals such as silver. Originally, wastewater systems were designed only to remove excreta and wastewater from urban areas. Water was used to flush away the waste, often discharging into nearby waterbodies. Since the 1970s, there has been increasing interest in treating the wastewater to protect the environment, and efforts focused primarily on cleaning the water at the end of the pipe. Since around the year 2003, the concepts of ecological sanitation and sustainable sanitation have emerged with the focus on recovering resources from wastewater. As of 2016, the term \"toilet resources\" came into use, and encouraged more attention to the potential for resource recovery from toilets.\n\nThe following resources can be recovered: \n\nOther methods are also being developed for transforming wastewater into valuable products. Growing Black Soldier Flies in excreta or organic waste can produce fly larvae as a protein feed. Other researchers are harvesting fatty acids from wastewater to make bioplastics.\n\nDisposed materials that are organic in nature, such as plant material, food scraps, and paper products, can be recycled using biological composting and digestion processes to decompose the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as mulch or compost for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter.\n\nThere is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see mechanical biological treatment). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being aerobic or anaerobic methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.\n\nAnaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been found to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or pyrolysis. Life cycle analysis (LCA) was used to compare different technologies. The resulting biogas (methane) though must be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used with a little upgrading in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to hydrogen for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells. Its use in fuel cells eliminates the pollution from products of combustion. There is a large variety of composting and digestion methods and technologies varying in complexity from simple home compost heaps, to small town scale batch digesters, industrial-scale, enclosed-vessel digestion of mixed domestic waste (see mechanical biological treatment). Methods of biological decomposition are differentiated as being aerobic or anaerobic methods, though hybrids of the two methods also exist.\n\nIn many countries, source-separated curbside collection is one method of resource recovery.\n\nIn Australia, every urban domestic household is provided with three bins: one for recycling; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin is provided by the municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have dual-stream recycling, with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the recovered materials are trucked to a materials recovery facility for further processing.\n\nMunicipal, commercial and industrial, construction and demolition debris is dumped at landfills and some is recycled. Household disposal materials are segregated: recyclables sorted and made into new products, and unusable material is dumped in landfill areas. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the recycling rate is high and is \"increasing, with 99% of households reporting that they had recycled or reused within the past year (2003 survey), up from 85% in 1992\". In 2002–03 \"30% of materials from municipalities, 45% from commercial and industrial generators and 57% from construction and demolition debris\" was recycled. Energy is produced is part of resource recovery as well: some landfill gas is captured for fuel or electricity generation, although this is considered the last resort, as the point of resource recovery is avoidance of landfill disposal altogether.\n\nResource recovery is a key component in a business' ability to maintaining ISO14001 accreditation. Companies are encouraged to improve their environmental efficiencies each year. One way to do this is by changing a company from a system of managing wastes to a resource recovery system (such as recycling: glass, food waste, paper and cardboard, plastic bottles etc.)\n\nEducation and awareness in the area of resource recovery is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources. Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of \"green house\" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and resource recovery programs. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations, e.g., WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management. Many supermarkets encourage customers to use their reverse vending machines to deposit used purchased containers and receive a refund from the recycling fees. Brands that manufacture such machines include Tomra and Envipco.\n\nIn 2010, CNBC aired the documentary \"\" about waste, what happens to it when it's \"thrown away\", and its impact on the world.\n\nExtended producer responsibility (EPR) is a pricing strategy that promotes integrating all costs associated with a given product throughout its life cycle. Having the market price also reflect the \"end-of-life disposal costs\" encourages more accuracy in pricing. Extended producer responsibility is meant to impose accountability over the entire lifecycle of products, from production, to packaging, to transport and disposal or reuse. EPR requires firms that manufacture, import and/or sell products to be responsible for those products throughout the life and disposal or reuse of products.\n\n"}
{"id": "42396382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42396382", "title": "Right to be forgotten", "text": "Right to be forgotten\n\nThe right to be forgotten is a concept that has been discussed and put into practice both in the European Union (EU) and, since 2006, in Argentina. The issue has arisen from desires of individuals to \"determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past.\"\n\nThere has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten to the status of an international human right in respect to access to information, due in part to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right. Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to freedom of expression, its interaction with the right to privacy, and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the Internet through censorship and a rewriting of history. Those in favour of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as revenge porn sites appearing in search engine listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed many years ago. The central concern here being, these results can unduly play a prominent role in a person's online presence almost indefinitely if not removed.\n\nEurope's data protection legislation are intended to secure potentially damaging, private information about individuals. The notion of \"the right to be forgotten\" is derived from numerous preexisting European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are \"spent\", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right - le droit à l'oubli (the right to be forgotten). It was officially recognized in French Law in 2010. Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between America and EU countries. In America, transparency, the right of free speech according to the First Amendment, and the right to know have typically been favored over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term \"right to be forgotten\" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the \"right to be forgotten\" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the \"Costeja\" case.\n\nIn 1995, the European Union adopted the European Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data. This is now considered a component of human rights law. The new European Proposal for General Data Protection Regulation provides protection and exemption for companies listed as \"media\" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a \"media\" company and so is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a \"data controller\" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These \"data controllers\" are required under EU law to remove data that is \"inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant\", making this directive of global importance.\n\nThe right to be forgotten \"reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them.\" It has been defined as \"the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring.\" The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos or photographs about themselves deleted from certain internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.\n\nThe right to be forgotten is distinct from the right to privacy, due to the distinction that the right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.\n\nLimitations of application in a jurisdiction include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google can not escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have \"extra-territorial effects\".\n\nIn Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to internet protection for individuals. In 2012 the European Commission disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which includes specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.\n\nTo exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. Google's removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification. The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased. After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing \"the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know\", deciding if the website is \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed\". Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions. However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them \"to shape interpretation to [their] own ends\". In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google, in an open letter.\n\nThe form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. \"The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request\" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy. Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be presented. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the person for whom the request is being made does in fact approve.\nThe form allows people to submit the name they would like search results removed for. However, it only allows for the submission of one name, which some view as one of its flaws. For example, if someone known as both \"Lawrence Smith\" and \"Larry Smith\" were to submit a form for the removal of search results for his name, he would only be allowed to indicate one of these names on the form. Many people view it as inconvenient and believe it is a problem that Google should be able to easily fix.\n\nIf Google refuses a request to delink material, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agency. As of May 2015, the British Data Protection Agency had treated 184 such complaints, and overturned Google's decision in about a quarter of those. If Google objects to a Data Protection Agency decision, it can face legal action.\n\nIn July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicised delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU Data Protection Directive, since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available. Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later. Commentators like Charles Arthur, technology editor of \"The Guardian\", and Andrew Orlowski of \"The Register\" noted that Google is not required to comply with removal requests at all, as it can refer requests to the information commissioner in the relevant country for a decision weighing the respective merits of public interest and individual rights.\n\nGoogle notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and the BBC and other news organizations have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so. Google complied with the request. Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior.\n\nAs of May 2014, Google has removed 1,390,838 URLs. From a gathering of which websites had the most amount of links removed, Facebook won with a total of 11,973 URLs removed. YouTube had 5,999 removed, Google Groups had 7,246 removed, and Twitter had 4,588 removed. Though Facebook had the largest number of deleted URLs, there were other received requests that were not granted deletion. While Google does evaluate millions of URLs that have been requested to be removed, the ultimate decision must be made by a human \"because the variables, including public interest claims, needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis\". However, it is to be kept in mind that internet users can still find removed information somewhat easily, just not through European Google search engines.\n\nIn July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that \"shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information – not criminals, politicians and public figures.\"\n\nThis data leak caused serious social consequences for Google as the public expressed their outrage and fear over the information that was recently made public. Though only 5% of requests were made by criminals, politicians, and public figures, the content removed was what sparked the most fear. In particular, one request for data removal was from a British doctor requesting to have 50 links removed on past botched medical procedures. Google agreed to remove three search results containing his personal information. The public voiced their outrage stating that removing such information can be used for manipulation and could lead to innocent people making uninformed decisions. Google responded to the public outrage by saying that when removing content they consider both the right of the individual and public interest.\n\nThe European Union has been pushing for the delinkings requested by EU citizens to be implemented by Google not just in European versions of Google (as in google.co.uk, google.fr, etc.), but on google.com and other international subdomains. Regulators want delinkings to be implemented so that the law cannot be circumvented in any way. Google has refused the French Data Protection Agency's demand to apply the right internationally. Due in part to their refusal to comply with the recommendation of the privacy regulating board Google has become the subject of a four-year-long antitrust investigation by the European Commission. In September 2015, the French Data Protection Agency dismissed Google's appeal.\n\nAs of September 2015, the most delinked site is \"www.facebook.com\". Three of Google's own sites, \"groups.google.com\", \"plus.google.com\" and \"www.youtube.com\" are among the ten most delinked sites. In addition to Google, Yahoo and Bing have also put up forms for making delinking requests.\n\nIn May 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled against Google in \"Costeja\", a case brought by a Spanish man, Mario Costeja González, who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in \"La Vanguardia\" newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid. He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to the Spanish Agency of data protection, which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results. Google sued in the Spanish \"Audiencia Nacional\" (National High Court) which referred a series of questions to the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in \"Costeja\" that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU data privacy laws. On its first day of compliance only (May 30, 2014), Google received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine.\n\nOn October 27, 2009, lawyers for Wolfgang Werlé who—together with Manfred Lauber—was convicted of murdering Walter Sedlmayr sent the Wikimedia Foundation a cease and desist letter requesting that Werlé's name be removed from the English language Wikipedia article Walter Sedlmayr, citing a 1973 Federal Constitutional Court decision that allows the suppression of a criminal's name in news accounts once he is released from custody. Previously, Alexander H. Stopp, attorney for Werlé and Lauber, had won a default judgment in German court, on behalf of Lauber, against the Wikimedia Foundation. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Werlé's lawyers also challenged an Internet service provider in Austria which published the names of the convicted killers.\n\nWikimedia is based in the United States, where the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. In Germany, the law seeks to protect the name and likenesses of private persons from unwanted publicity. On January 18, 2008, a court in Hamburg supported the personality rights of Werlé, which under German law includes removing his name from archive coverage of the case.\n\nOn November 12, 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported that Wolfgang Werlé had a case pending against the Wikimedia Foundation in a German court. The editors of the German-language Wikipedia removed the names of the murderers, which have since then been restored to the article. \"The Guardian\" observed that the lawsuit has led to the Streisand effect, an upsurge in publicity for the case resulting from the legal action.\n\nOn December 15, 2009, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in Karlsruhe ruled that German websites do not have to check their archives in order to provide permanent protection of personality rights for convicted criminals. The case occurred after the names of the brothers were found on the website of Deutschlandradio, in an archive article dating from July 2000. The presiding judge Gregor Galke stated \"This is not a blank check\", and pointed out that the right to rehabilitation of offenders had been taken into consideration.\n\nArgentina has seen law suits by celebrities against Google and Yahoo! in which the plaintiffs demand the removal of certain search results, and require removal of links to photographs. One case, brought by artist Virginia da Cunha, involved photographs which had originally been taken with her permission and uploaded with her permission, however she alleged that the search results improperly associated her photographs with pornography. De Cunha's case achieved initial success resulting in Argentine search engines not showing images of the particular celebrity, however this decision is on appeal.\n\nVirginia Simari, the judge in favor of De Cunha, stated that people have the right to control their image and avert others from \"capturing, reproducing, broadcasting, or publishing one's image without permission.\" In addition, Simari used a treatise written by Julio César Rivera, a Buenos Aires lawyer, author, and law professor \"the right to control one's personal data includes the right to prevent others from using one's image.\" Since the 1990s Argentina has also been a part of the habeas data movement in which they \"adopted a constitutional provision that is part freedom-of-government-information law and part data privacy law.\" However, their version is known as amparo. Article 43 explains the version:\n\n\"Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or databases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data.\"\n\nArgentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called 'the most complete' because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential.\n\nConsideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in \"Melvin v. Reid\", and in \"Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.\"\n\nIn \"Melvin v. Reid\" (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film \"The Red Kimono\" revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer. The court reasoned that \"any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation.\"\n\nIn \"Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.\" (1940), the plaintiff, William James Sidis, was a former child prodigy who wished to spend his adult life quietly, without recognition; however, this was disrupted by an article in \"The New Yorker\". The court held here that there were limits to the right to control one's life and facts about oneself, and held that there is social value in published facts, and that a person cannot ignore their celebrity status merely because they want to.\n\nThere is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression, or will constitute censorship, thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the United States Constitution. These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.\n\nIn a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that \"many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy – even some guaranteed by law – have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances.\" Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the \"right to be forgotten\", noted that existing laws that require adverse information to be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allow the sealing or expunging of criminals records, are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search.\n\nOn March 11, 2015, Intelligence Squared US, an organization that stages Oxford-Style debates, held an event centered on the question, \"Should the U.S. adopt the 'Right to be Forgotten' online?\" The side against the motion won with a 56% majority of the voting audience.\n\nWhile opinions among experts are divided in the U.S., one survey indicated that 9 in 10 Americans want some form of the right to be forgotten. The consumer rights organization Consumer Watchdog has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for Americans to obtain the right as well.\n\nIn March 2017, New York state senator Tony Avella and assemblyman David Weprin introduced a bill proposing that individuals be allowed to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is \"inaccurate\", \"irrelevant\", \"inadequate\", or \"excessive\", that is \"no longer material to current public debate or discourse\" and is causing demonstrable harm to the subject.\n\nIn April 2016, the Delhi High Court began to examine the issue after a Delhi banker requested to have his personal details removed from search results following a marital dispute. In this case, due to the dispute being settled, the banker's request is valid. The High Court has asked for a reply from Google and other search engine companies by September 19, upon which the court will continue to investigate the issue.\n\nIn January 2017 the Karnataka High Court upheld the right to be forgotten, in a case involving a woman who originally went to court in order to get a marriage certificate annulled, claiming to have never been married to the man on the certificate. After the two parties came to an agreement, the woman's father wanted her name to be removed from search engines regarding criminal cases in the high court. The Karnataka High Court approved the father's request, stating that she had a right to be forgotten. According to the court, its ruling would align with western countries' decisions, which typically approve of the right to be forgotten when dealing with cases \"involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned.\" The woman in this specific case was worried that the search results would affect her standing with her husband, as well as her reputation in society.\n\nAs of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine. The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options. The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India. Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed. This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India.\n\nIn May 2016, South Korea's Korea Communications Commission (KCC) announced citizens will be able to request search engines and website administrators to restrict their own postings from being publicly accessible. The KCC released \"Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings\", which will take effect in June 2016, which will not apply to third party contents. To the extent that the right to be forgotten concerns a data subject's right to limit the searchability of third party postings about him/her, the Guideline does not constitute a right to be forgotten. Also, as to the right to withdraw one's own posting, critics have noted that people have been able to delete their own postings before the Guideline as long as they have retained their login credentials, and that people who have misplaced their login credentials were permitted to retrieve or receive new ones. The only services significantly affected by the Guideline are Wiki-type services where people's contributions make logical sense only in response to or in conjunction with one another's contributions and therefore the postings are made permanent part of the mass-created content, but KCC made sure that the Guideline applies to these services only when the posting identifies the authors.\n\nThe guidelines created by the KCC include that data subjects can remove content that includes the URL links, and any evidence consisting of personal information. The commission included different amendments to the guideline. This includes describing the Guidelines as a \"minimum\" and \"preliminary\" precaution regarding privacy rights in vague areas of existing laws. The guideline encompasses foreign Internet companies that provide translation services for South Korean consumers. In order to have a person's information \"forgotten\" he or she has to go through a three step process: the issue posted with the URL, proof of ownership of the post, grounds for the request. There are restrictions on each step. When posting the URL, the web operator has the right to preserve the posting issue. The second being that if the post is relevant to public interest, web operators will process this request on the terms of relevance.\n\nIn May 2016, Chinese courts in Beijing determined citizens do not have the right to be forgotten when a judge ruled in favor of Baidu in a lawsuit over removing search results. It was the first of such cases to be heard in Chinese court. In the suit, Ren Jiayu sued Chinese search engine Baidu over search results that associated him with a previous employer, Wuxi Taoshi Biotechnology. Ren argued that by posting the search results, Baidu had infringed upon his right of name and right of reputation, both protected under Chinese law. Because of these protections, Ren believed he had a right to be forgotten by removing these search results. The court ruled against Ren, claiming his name is a collection of common characters and as a result the search results were derived from relevant words.\n\nChina has one of the longest histories as an entire nation, being over 2000 years of feudal society; their civil laws and personal rights have not been altered through legislative efforts. Nowhere in the country's civil agreement does it discuss the concept of \"privacy\", more specifically internet privacy, and the growing issue that citizens, \"have the right to be forgotten\" on the internet. There is no data protection authority or a specific state agency set in place to monitor the protection of citizens personal data. In China today, data protection is aimed at simply the consumer, as an individual. In contrast to the EU's right to privacy, which the individual is considered a \"data subject\", with the right to be protected. Chinese legislation remains neutral, with slow progression towards the support of the \"right to be forgotten\". The topic has been debated for more than 10 years now, and continues to be a challenge. Small provisions have been implemented related to personal data processing, however they do not amount to a comprehensive data protection regime. There is no solid, common ground to be found on two fundamentally different systems: realistic, to Chinese laws that are already in place, and legalist, the steps it takes to change those laws, approaches that elicit a need for reification.\n\nThe regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the Westphalian international system assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory. However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot. Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents.\n\nThe regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the Safe Harbor agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes. Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the \"third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection,\" meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection. The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to \"opt out\" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected. \n\nGiven the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous digital privacy regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to \"opt out\" and afford other protections.\n\nUnder the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice in its \"Schrems\" case. The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the Privacy Shield principles.\n\nThe 2012 draft European Data Protection Regulation Article 17 detailed the \"right to be forgotten and to erasure\". Under Article 17 individuals to whom the data appertains are granted the right to \"obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data, especially in relation to personal data which are made available by the data subject while he or she was a child or where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected for, the subject withdraws consent, the storage period has expired, the data subject objects to the processing of personal data or the processing of data does not comply with other regulation\".\n\nThe EU defines \"data controllers\" as \"people or bodies that collect and manage personal data\". The EU General Data Protection Regulation requires data controllers who have been informed that an individual has requested the deletion of any links to or copies of information must \"take all reasonable steps, including technical measures, in relation to data for the publication of which the controller is responsible, to inform third parties which are processing such data, that a data subject requests them to erase any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data. Where the controller has authorized a third party publication of personal data, the controller shall be considered responsible for that publication\". In the situation that a data controller does not take all reasonable steps then they will be fined heavily.\n\nThe European Parliament was once \"expected to adopt the proposals in first reading in the April 2013 Plenary session\". The right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right to erasure in the version of the GDPR adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014. Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data (see also Costeja).\n\nThe European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a \"Privacy Bill of Rights\" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten.\n\nBusinesses that manage their client's online reputation have responded to the European Court ruling by excercising the right to be forgotten as a means to remove unfavourable information. One technique used by reputation consulting firms is to submit multiple requests for each link, written with different angles in an attempt to get links removed. Google for example does not limit the number of requests that can be submitted on the removal of a given link. \n\nMajor criticisms stem from the idea that the right to be forgotten would restrict the right to freedom of speech. Many nations, and the United States in particular (with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution), have very strong domestic freedom of speech law, which would be challenging to reconcile with the right to be forgotten. Some academics see that only a limited form of the right to be forgotten would be reconcilable with US constitutional law; the right of an individual to delete data that he or she has personally submitted. In this limited form of the right individuals could not have material removed that has been uploaded by others, as demanding the removal of information could constitute censorship and a reduction in the freedom of expression in many countries. Sandra Coliver of the Open Society Justice Initiative argues that not all rights must be compatible and this conflict between the two rights is not detrimental to the survival of either.\n\nThe draft General Data Protection Regulation was written broadly and this has caused concern. It has attracted criticism that its enactment would require data controlling companies to go to great lengths to identify third parties with the information and remove it. The proposed regulation has also attracted criticism due to the fact that this could produce a censoring effect in that companies, such as Facebook or Google, will wish to not be fined under the act, and will therefore be likely to delete wholesale information rather than facing the fine, which could produce a \"serious chilling effect.\" In addition to this, there are concerns about the requirement to take down information that others have posted about an individual; the definition of personal data in Article 4(2) includes \"any information relating to\" the individual. This, critics have claimed, would require companies to take down any information relating to an individual, regardless of its source, which would amount to censorship, and result in the big data companies eradicating a lot of data to comply with this. Such removal can impact the accuracy and ability of businesses and individuals to carry out business intelligence, particularly due diligence to comply with antibribery, anticorruption, and know your customer laws. The right to be forgotten was invoked to remove from Google searches 120 reports about company directors published by Dato Capital, a Spanish company which compiles such reports about private company directors, consisting entirely of information they are required by law to disclose; \"Fortune\" magazine examined the 64 reports relating to UK directorships, finding that in 27 (42%) the director was the only person named, in the remaining only the director and co-directors were named, and 23 (36%) involve directorships started since 2012.\n\nOther criticism revolves around the principle of accountability.\n\nThere were concerns that the proposed General Data Protection Regulation would result in Google and other Internet search engines not producing neutral search results, but rather producing biased and patchy results, and compromising the integrity of Internet-based information. To balance out this criticism, the proposed General Data Protection Regulation included an exception \"for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the rules governing freedom of expression.\" Article 80 upheld freedom of speech, and while not lessening obligations on data providers and social media sites, nevertheless due to the wide meaning of \"journalistic purposes\" allows more autonomy and reduces the amount of information that is necessary to be removed. When Google agreed to implement the ruling, European Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding said, \"The Court also made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected.\" However, Google was criticized for taking down (under the Costeja precedent) a BBC News blog post about Stan O'Neal by economics editor Robert Peston (eventually, Peston reported that his blog post has remained findable in Google after all). Despite these criticisms and Google's action, the company's CEO, Larry Page worries that the ruling will be \"used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things\", though has since distanced himself from that position. For example, pianist Dejan Lazic cited the \"Right To Be Forgotten\" in trying to remove a negative review about his performance from \"The Washington Post\". He claimed that the critique was \"defamatory, mean-spirited, opionated, offensive and simply irrelevant for the arts\". and the St. Lawrence parish of the Roman Catholic church in Kutno, Poland asked Google to remove , without any allegations mentioned therein as of that date.\n\nIndex on Censorship claimed that the \"Costeja\" ruling \"allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history… The Court's decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider internet. It should send chills down the spine of everyone in the European Union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Gerry Hutch page on the English Wikipedia was among the first Wikipedia pages to be removed by several search engines' query results in the European Union. \"The Daily Telegraph\" said, on 6 Aug 2014, that Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales \"described the EU's Right to be Forgotten as deeply immoral, as the organisation that operates the online encyclopedia warned the ruling will result in an internet riddled with memory holes\". Other commentators have disagreed with Wales, pointing to problems such as Google including links to revenge porn sites in its search results, and have accused Google of orchestrating a publicity campaign to escape the burdensome obligation to comply with the law. Julia Powles, a law and technology researcher at the University of Cambridge, made a rebuttal to Wales' and the Wikimedia Foundation concerns in an editorial published by \"Guardian\", opining that \"There is a public sphere of memory and truth, and there is a private one...Without the freedom to be private, we have precious little freedom at all.\"\n\nIn response to the criticism, the EU has released a factsheet to address what it considers myths about the right to be forgotten.\n\nOther criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors. The California Minor Eraser Law is a law that allows California residents under the age of 18 to request to have information removed that they posted on an online server. The law \"applies to websites, social media sites, mobile apps and other online services\" and follows \"Europe's recognition of the 'right to be forgotten'\". This law was put into effect on January 1, 2015 and remains in existence today. Online \"service\" operators that have services \"directed toward minors\" must update their privacy policies to include the option to remove data if requested by a minor that is posted on a service.\n\nIn the UK, the 2017 Conservative manifesto included a pledge to allow social media platform users to remove outdated information that was posted when they were under the age of 18. \"A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content.\" The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the European Court of Justice regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law. However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life.\n\nTheresa May, the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted. May gave her stance on privacy when she said, \"'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'\". The Conservative Party, which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material.\n\nIn 2015, Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL), the data privacy watchdog of France trird to impose the right globally. CNIL asked Google to remove data from all versions available in any part of the world. Google and other entities argued that European data regulators should not be allowed to decide what Internet users around the world find when they use a search engine.\n\nSecurity researchers from CISPA, Saarland University and the University of Auckland proposed a framework, called Oblivion, to support the automation of the right to be forgotten in a scalable, provable and privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion is a program that helps to \"automate\" the process of attempting to verify someone's personal information that could be found in a Google search result.\" Google gets many take-down requests at a high volume, so Oblivion is able to help with this problem. Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that \"it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to internet size.\" Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot \"blacklist links to internet sources that do not affect them.\" For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second. The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.\n\nIn the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves – not limited to \"name, age, and nationality.\" Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an \"ownership token\" that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this \"ownership token\" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted. Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.\n\nResearchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own \"whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results.\" Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

If the women rated their wish as intense and long-standing, their wish was considered a life-longing. If they rated their wish as intense and attainable, it was simply a goal. “The pursuit of the wish for children as a life longing was positively related to well-being only when participants had high control over the experience of this life longing and when other self-regulation strategies (goal adjustment) failed.”\n\n\" is a poem by that inspired composers like and .

{"id": "1594796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1594796", "title": "Semantic gap", "text": "Semantic gap\n\nThe semantic gap characterizes the difference between two descriptions of an object by different linguistic representations, for instance languages or symbols. According to Hein, the semantic gap can be defined as \"the difference in meaning between constructs formed within different representation systems\". In computer science, the concept is relevant whenever ordinary human activities, observations, and tasks are transferred into a computational representation.\n\nMore precisely the gap means the difference between ambiguous formulation of contextual knowledge in a powerful language (e.g. natural language) and its sound, reproducible and computational representation in a formal language (e.g. programming language). Semantics of an object depends on the context it is regarded within. For practical application this means any formal representation of real world tasks requires the translation of the contextual expert knowledge of an application (high-level) into the elementary and reproducible operations of a computing machine (low-level). Since natural language allows the expression of tasks which are impossible to compute in a formal language there are no means to automatize this translation in a general way. Moreover, the examination of languages within the Chomsky hierarchy indicates that there is no formal and consequently automated way of translating from one language into another above a certain level of expressional power.\n\nThe yet unproven but commonly accepted Church-Turing thesis states that a Turing machine and all equivalent formal languages such as the lambda calculus perform and represent all formal operations respectively as applied by a computing human. However the selection of adequate operations for the correct computation itself is not formally deducible, moreover it depends on the computability of the underlying problem. Tasks, such as the halting problem, may be formulated comprehensively in natural language, but the computational representation will not terminate or does not provide a usable result, which is proven by Rice's theorem. The general expression of limitations for rule based deduction by Gödel's incompleteness theorem indicates that the semantic gap is never to be fully closed. These are general statements, considering the generalized limits of computation on the highest level of abstraction where the semantic gap manifests itself. There are however lots of subsets of problems which may be translated automatically, especially in the higher numbered levels of the Chomsky hierarchy.\n\nReal world tasks are formalized by programming languages, which are executed on computers based on the von Neumann architecture. Since programming languages are only comfortable representations of the Turing machine any program on a von Neumann computer has the same properties and limitations as the Turing machine or its equivalent representation. Consequently, every programming language such as CPU level machine code, assembler, or any high level programming language has the same expressional power as the underlying Turing machine is able to compute. There is no semantic gap between them since a program is transferred from the high level language to the machine code by a program, e.g. a compiler which itself runs on a Turing machine without any user interaction. The semantic gap actually opens between the selection of the rules and the representation of the task.\n\nSelection of rules for formal representations of real world applications, corresponds to writing a program. Writing programs is independent from the actual programming language and basically requires the translation of the domain specific knowledge of the user into the formal rules operating a turing machine. It is this transfer from contextual knowledge into formal representation which cannot be automatized with respect to the theoretical limitations of computation. Consequently, any mapping from real world applications into computer applications requires a certain amount of technical background knowledge by the user, where the semantic gap manifests itself.\n\nIt is a fundamental task of software engineering to close the gap between application specific knowledge and technically doable formalization. For this purpose domain specific (high-level) knowledge must be transferred into an algorithm and its parameters (low-level). This requires the dialogue between user and developer. Aim is always a software which allows the user to represent his knowledge as parameters of an algorithm without knowing the details of the implementation, and to interpret the outcome of the algorithm without the aid of the developer. For this purpose user interfaces play the key role in software design, while developers are supported by frameworks which help organizing the integration of contextual information.\n\nA simple example can be formulated as a series of increasingly difficult natural language queries to locate a \"target document\" that may or may not exist locally on a known computer system.\n\nExample queries:\n\nThe progressive difficulty of these queries is represented by the increasing degree of abstraction from the types and semantics defined the system architecture (directories and files on a known computer) to the types and semantics that occupy the realm of ordinary human discourse (subjects such as \"humor\" and entities such as \"my grandmother\"). Moreover, this disparity of realms is further complicated by leaky abstractions, such as is common in the case of query 4), where the \"target document\" may exist, but may not encapsulate the \"metadata\" in a manner expected by the user, nor the designer of the query processing system.\n\nImage analysis is a typical domain for which a high degree of abstraction from low-level methods is required, and where the semantic gap immediately affects the user. If image content is to be identified to understand the meaning of an image, the only available independent information is the low-level pixel data. Textual annotations always depend on the knowledge, capability of expression and specific language of the annotator and therefore is unreliable. To recognize the displayed scenes from the raw data of an image the algorithms for selection and manipulation of pixels must be combined and parameterized in an adequate manner and finally linked with the natural description. Even the simple linguistic representation of shape or color such as round or yellow requires entirely different mathematical formalization methods, which are neither intuitive nor unique and sound.\nIn many layered systems, some conflicts arise when concepts at a high level of abstraction need to be translated into lower, more concrete artifacts. This mismatch is often called semantic gap.\n\nOODBMSs (object-oriented database management system) advocates sometimes claim that these databases help to reduce the semantic gap between the application domain (miniworld) and the traditional RDBMS systems. . However Relational proponents would posit the exact opposite, because by definition object databases fix the data being recorded into a single binding abstraction.\n\n"}
{"id": "520099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=520099", "title": "Siteswap", "text": "Siteswap\n\nSiteswap is a juggling notation used to describe or represent juggling patterns. \"Siteswap\" may also be used to describe siteswap patterns, possible patterns transcribed using siteswap. It encodes the number of beats of each throw, which is related to their relative height, and the hand to which the throw is to be made: \"The idea behind siteswap is to keep track of the order that balls are thrown and caught, and only that.\" It is an invaluable tool in determining which combinations of throws yield valid juggling patterns for a given number of objects, and has led to previously unknown patterns (such as 441). However, it does not describe body movements such as behind-the-back and under-the-leg. Siteswap assumes that, \"throws happen on beats that are equally spaced in time.\"\n\nThrows are represented, \"by integers that specify the number of beats in the future when the object is thrown again.\"\n\nThe numbers are as follows:\n\nFor example, a three-ball cascade may be notated \"3\", while a shower may be notated \"5 1\". The height, and thus difficulty, of throws increases exponentially and siteswaps above 5 are rare except in numbers juggling\n\nThe notation was invented by Paul Klimek in Santa Cruz, California in 1981, and later developed by undergraduates Bruce \"Boppo\" Tiemann and the late Bengt Magnusson at the California Institute of Technology in 1985, and by Mike Day, mathematician Colin Wright, and mathematician Adam Chalcraft in Cambridge, England in 1985 (whence comes the alternative name). The numbers derive from the number of balls used in the most common juggling patterns. Siteswap has been described as, \"perhaps the most popular\".\n\nIts simplest form, sometimes called vanilla siteswap, describes only patterns whose throws alternate hands and in which one ball is thrown at a time. If we were to watch someone from above as they were juggling while walking forward, we might see something like the adjacent diagram, which is sometimes called a space-time diagram or ladder diagram. In this diagram, time progresses from the top to the bottom.\n\nWe can describe this pattern by stating how many throws later the ball is thrown again. For instance, on the first throw in the diagram, the purple ball is thrown in the air by the right hand, next the blue ball, the green ball, the green ball again, and the blue ball again and then finally the purple ball is caught and thrown by the left hand on the fifth throw, this gives the first throw a count of \"5\". We end up with a sequence of numbers which denote the height of each throw to be made. Since hands alternate, odd-numbered throws send the ball to the other hand, while even-numbered throws send the ball to the same hand. A \"3\" represents a throw to the opposite hand at the height of the basic three-cascade; a \"4\" represents a throw to the same hand at the height of the four-fountain, and so on.\n\nThere are three special throws: a \"0\" is a pause with an empty hand, a \"1\" is a quick pass straight across to the other hand, and a \"2\" is a momentary hold of an object. Throws longer than \"9\" beats are given letters starting with \"a\". The number of beats a ball is in the air usually corresponds to how high it was thrown, so many people refer to the numbers as heights, but this is not technically correct; all that matters is the number of beats in the air, not how high it is thrown. For example, bouncing a ball takes longer than a throw in the air to the same height, and so can be a higher siteswap value while being a lower throw.\n\nEach pattern repeats after a certain number of throws, called the \"period\" of the pattern. The pattern is named after the shortest repeating segment of the sequence, so the pattern diagrammed on the right is 53145305520 and has a period of 11. If the period is an odd number, like this one, then each time you repeat the sequence you're starting with the other hand, and the pattern is symmetrical because each hand is doing the same thing (although at different times). If the period is an even number then on every repeat of the pattern, each hand does the same thing it did last time and the pattern is asymmetrical.\n\nThe number of balls used for the pattern is the average of the throw numbers in the pattern. For example, \"441\" is a three-object pattern because (4+4+1)/3 is 3, and \"86\" is a seven-object pattern. All patterns must therefore have a siteswap sequence that averages to an integer. Not all such sequences describe patterns; for example \"543\" with integer average 4 but its three throws all land at the same time, colliding.\n\nSome hold to a convention in that a siteswap is written with its highest numbers first. One drawback to doing so is evident in the pattern \"51414\", a 3-ball pattern which cannot be inserted into the middle of a string of 3-throws, unlike its rotation \"45141\" which can.\n\nJust after throwing a ball (or club or other juggling object), all balls are in the air and are only under the influence of gravity. Assuming you catch the balls at a consistent level, then the timing of when the balls land is already determined. We can mark each point in time when a ball is going to land with an \"x\", and each point in time when there is not yet a ball scheduled to land with a \"-\". This describes the state that you're in and determines what you can throw next. For instance, we can look at the state just after our first throw in the diagram, it is xx--x. We can use the state to determine what can be thrown next. First we take the \"x\" off the left hand side (that's the ball that's landing next) and shift everything else to the left filling in a \"-\" on the right. This leaves us with x--x-. Since we caught a ball (the x we removed from the left) we can't \"throw\" a 0 next. We also can't throw a 1 or a 4, because there are already balls scheduled to land there. So assuming that the highest we can accurately throw a ball is to a height of 5, then we can only throw a 2, 3, or a 5. In this diagram, the juggler threw a 3, so an x goes in the third spot, replacing the -, and we have x-xx- as the new state.\nThe diagram on the left shows all possible states for someone juggling three items and a maximum height of 5. From each state you can follow the arrows and the corresponding numbers give you the siteswap. Any path which brings you back to the same state that you started with is a valid siteswap, and all siteswaps can be generated this way. The diagram becomes a lot bigger very fast when more balls or higher throws are introduced as there are more possible states and more possible throws. \n\nAnother method of representing siteswap states is having the next throw on the right and read to the left (instead of the left to right system described above), represent a ball with a 1 instead of an x, and represent a spot where there's no ball scheduled to land with a 0 instead of a -. Then the state can be represented with a binary number, such as binary 10011 for the first state in the space-time diagram above. This method makes it a lot easier to represent more objects or higher throws as it is less complicated to create.\nThe table on the right contains the same information as the diagram on the left. To generate a siteswap, first find the row of your starting state. Reading across the row will give you the possible numbers you can throw and the column will give you the resulting state. Moving like this from state to state until you end up back in your starting state will give you a valid siteswap.\n\nVanilla siteswap patterns may be viewed as certain elements of the affine Weyl group of type formula_1. One presentation of this group is as the set of bijective functions \"f\" on the integers such that, for a fixed \"n\": \"f\"(\"i\" + \"n\") = \"f\"(\"i\") + \"n\" for all integers \"i\". If the element \"f\" satisfies the further condition that \"f\"(\"i\") ≥ \"i\" for all \"i\", then \"f\" corresponds to the (infinitely repeated) siteswap pattern whose \"i\"th number is \"f\"(\"i\") − \"i\": that is, the ball thrown at time \"i\" will land at time \"f\"(\"i\").\n\nA subset of these siteswap patterns naturally label strata in the positroid stratification of the Grassmannian.\n\n\"Several jugglers who have spent time in working on site swaps describe the same gain in flexibility and conceptual power that mathematicians seem to report from the use of well-chosen abstractions.\"\n\nMulti-hand notation was developed by Ed Carstens in 1992 for use with his juggling program JugglePro. Siteswap notation in its simplest form (\"Vanilla siteswap\") assumes that only one ball is thrown at a time. It follows that any valid siteswap for two hands will also be valid for any number of hands, on the condition that the hands throw after each other. Commonly used multi-hand siteswaps are \"1-handed (diabolo) siteswap\", and \"4-handed (passing) siteswap\".\n\n1-handed (diabolo) \n\nThe siteswap is performed by a single hand, or a diabolo player throwing diabolos at different heights.\n\n4-handed \n\nValid siteswaps can be juggled by a 4-handed juggler, or for 2 jugglers coordinating 4 hands, on the condition that hands throw alternately.\n\nIn practice, this is most easily obtained if the jugglers throw by turns, one sequence being (Right hand of juggler A, right hand of juggler B, left hand of A, left hand of B).\n\nSiteswap notation can be extended to denote patterns containing synchronous throws from both hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in parentheses and separated by a comma. Only even numbers are allowed (each throw involves two hands, and thus only even numbers), so throws that move to the other hand are marked by an \"x\". Thus a synchronous three-prop shower is denoted \"(4x,2x)\", meaning one hand continually throws a low throw or 'zip' to the opposite hand, while the other continually makes a higher throw to the first. Sequences of bracketed pairs are written without delimiting markers.\n\nA further extension allows siteswap to notate patterns involving multiple throws from either or both hands at the same time in a multiplex pattern. The numbers for multiple throws from a single hand are written together inside square brackets. For example, \"[33]33\" is a normal 3-ball cascade, with a pair of balls always thrown together.\n\nSimultaneous juggling: \"<xxx|yyy>\" notation means one juggler does 'xxx' while another does 'yyy'. 'p' is used to represent a passing throw. For example, \"<3p 3|3p 3>\" is a 6 prop '2 count' passing pattern, where all left hand throws are passes and right hand throws are selves. This can also be used with synchronous patterns; a two-person 'shower' is then \"<(4xp,2x)|(4xp,2x)>\"\n\nIf the pattern contains fractions, e.g. \"<4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5>\" the juggler after the bar is supposed to be half a count later, and all fractions are passes. If both juggle the same pattern (although shifted in time), the pattern is called a social siteswap and only half of the pattern needs to be written: \"<4p 3| 3 4p>\" becomes \"4p 3\" and \"<4.5 3 3| 3 4.5 3>\" becomes \"4.5 3 3\".\n\nVarious other enhancements to the siteswap system have been proposed and enjoy some use.\n\nThere are many free computer programs available which simulate juggling patterns. \n\nThere are also some games to play with siteswap:\n\n\n"}

According to Jain Philosophy, these twelve contemplations pertain to eternal truths like nature of universe, human existence, and karma on which one must meditate.

According to the book \"\", in 1904 alone, four players were killed during hockey games from the frequent brawls and violent stickwork.\n\nMore modern examples of violence include brawls, fan involvement, physical abuse of officials and deliberately injuring opponents. Violent actions such as kicking, hitting from behind and prohibited stickwork, are penalized with suspensions or fines. Fighting, or fisticuffs, is also penalized but is considered by many hockey enthusiasts, particularly in North America, to be quite distinct from stick-swinging or other violent acts. They regard fighting as an entrenched, acceptable and integral part of the game.\n\nOn the ice, referees may impose penalties for prohibited activities. Off the ice, the National Hockey League (NHL) sometimes fines, suspends or expels players. The criminal justice system has also been known to investigate, charge and convict players. As a result, hockey has become much more regulated and the violent element much more controlled. This has been aided, in no small part, by dramatic increases in disciplinary processes and technology allowing for a high level of scrutiny of any event which occurs.\n\nEarly hockey in particular was noted for its extreme violence, to the point where two players were killed in three years during brawls. In both cases, the accused assailants were acquitted, but these and other bloody incidents led to calls for the sport to clean up its act or be banned along with the likes of cockfighting. The worst of the violence waned, particularly with the advent of regulations for quasi-legal fisticuffs, though incidents continue to occur from time to time.\n\nBilly Coutu was the first, and to date only, player banned from the NHL for life for violence in 1927; he assaulted referee Jerry Laflamme and tackled referee Billy Bell before starting a bench-clearing brawl during a Stanley Cup game between the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators, apparently on the orders of Bruins Head Coach Art Ross. The NHL's first president, Frank Calder, expelled Coutu from the NHL for life; the ban was lifted after two-and-a-half years, but Coutu never played in the NHL again.\n\nOther incidents include the December 12, 1933, event when Eddie Shore rammed Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey from behind, causing Bailey to strike his head on the ice; Bailey never played hockey again. More recently, controversy and criminal charges have resulted from violent attacks by Marty McSorley, Todd Bertuzzi and Chris Simon.\n\nPlayers who are banned in the American Hockey League (AHL) for violence are not permitted in the ECHL, and vice versa, because of their agreements with the Professional Hockey Players' Association.\n\nIn January 2012, David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada, said that violence such as headshots, high-sticking and fighting should not be part of the sport.\n\nThere have been two major Canadian reports on violence in hockey. In 1974, William McMurtry provided a report for the Government of Ontario entitled \"Investigation and Inquiry into Violence in Amateur Hockey\". In 2000, Bernie Pascall prepared a report for the Government of British Columbia entitled \"Eliminating Violence in Hockey\".\n\n\n\nAll of these incidents are in the NHL of the United States and Canada, unless noted otherwise.\n\n"}

Wall Street is the home of the country's two largest stock exchanges, and \"Wall Street\" is a metonym for the American financial sector. Major Wall Street reform bills include the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The most recent Wall Street reform bill, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, was signed by President of the United States Barack Obama on July 22, 2010, following a global financial crisis.\n\nThe Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 placed a \"wall of separation\" between banks and brokerages, which was largely repealed by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The bill was enacted during the Great Depression, which began with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 repealed the \"wall of separation,\" allowing companies to simultaneously act as commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies. Though some commentators regard the restoration of the 1933 bill as crucial, even calling it \"the most vital element of Wall Street reform\", House Democratic leaders refused to allow an amendment by Rep. Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) to restore Glass-Steagall as part of the 2009 Frank bill. Hinchey introduced his proposal as a separate bill, the Glass-Steagall Restoration Act of 2009. Nonetheless, the \"Volcker rule\" proposed by the Obama administration has been described as a \"new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century\", as it establishes stringent rules against banks using their own money to make risky investments.\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-OH), was signed into law by George W. Bush in July 2002. The bill was enacted as a reaction to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals including those affecting Enron and WorldCom.\n\nAs of May 2010, both the House and Senate bills had been passed, but the differences between the bills were to be worked out in United States congressional conference committee. Differences which must be resolved include: whether the new consumer protection agency would be independent (Senate) or part of the Federal Reserve; whether to require banks to issue credit derivatives in separately capitalized affiliates (Senate); how exactly the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will wind down or bail out large institutions which fail; the circumstances under which large institutions could be broken up; a 15 to 1 leverage limit in the House bill; the terms of a Fed audit (continuous as in the House bill or one-time as in the Senate bill); both bills include the Volcker rule which prohibits proprietary trading by bank holding companies, but both have a caveat which allow for regulators to overrule the rule; both bills propose to regulate credit rating agencies, but the Senate's bill is much stronger.\n\nH.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA), passed by the House of Representatives in December 2009, and awaiting action by the Senate as of April 2010.\n\nS.3217 was introduced by Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd (D-CT) on April 15, 2010. Dodd's bill included a $50 billion liquidation fund which drew criticism as a continuing bailout, which he was pressured to remove by Republicans and the Obama administration. The Senate bill passed on May 20, 2010.\n\nThe \"Volcker Rule\" was proposed by President Barack Obama based on advice by Paul Volcker, and a draft of the proposed legislation was prepared by the U.S. Treasury Department. It limited any one bank from holding more than 10% of FDIC-insured deposits, and prohibited any bank with a division holding such deposits from using its own capital to make speculative investments. The Volcker rule faced heavy resistance in the Senate and was introduced as part of the subsequent Dodd bill only in a limited form.\n\nChaired by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, a new multi-authority oversight body called the Financial Stability Oversight Council of regulators will be established. The council will consist of nine members including regulators from the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and many other agencies. The main purpose of the council is to identify risk in the Financial system. Also, the council will look at the interconnectivity of the highly leveraged financial firms and can ask companies to divest holdings if their structure poses a great threat to the Financial system. The council will have a solid control on the operations of the leveraged firms and also help in increasing the transparency.\n\nIn 2016, 170 Economists, Financial Experts, and Academics Back Bernie Sanders' Wall Street Reform Plan. In the letter supporting Bernie Sander's Financial Reform Plan \n\n\"\"In our view, Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for comprehensive financial reform is critical for avoiding another \"too-big-to-fail\" financial crisis. The Senator is correct that the biggest banks must be broken up and that a new 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, separating investment from commercial banking, must be enacted.\nWall Street's largest banks are now far bigger than they were before the crisis, and they still have every incentive to take excessive risks. No major Wall Street executive has been indicted for the fraudulent behavior that led up to the 2008 crash, and fines imposed on the banks have been only a fraction of the banks' potential gains. In addition, the banks and their lobbyists have succeeded in watering down the Dodd-Frank reform legislation, and the financial institutions that pose the greatest risk to our economy have still not devised sufficient \"living wills\" for winding down their operations in the event of another crisis.\nSecretary Hillary Clinton's more modest proposals do not go far enough. They call for a bit more oversight and a few new charges on shadow banking activity, but they leave intact the titanic financial conglomerates that practice most shadow banking. As a result, her plan does not adequately reduce the serious risks our financial system poses to the American economy and to individual Americans. Given the size and political power of Wall Street, her proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain Wall Street's excesses is with reforms sufficiently bold and public they can't be watered down. That's why we support Senator Sanders' plans for busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting a modernized version of Glass Steagall.\"\"\n\n"}
