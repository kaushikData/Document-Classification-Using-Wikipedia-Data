If that stimulus exceeds the threshold potential, the nerve or muscle fibre will give a complete response; otherwise, there is no response. \n\nIt was first established by the American physiologist Henry Pickering Bowditch in 1871 for the contraction of heart muscle. According to him, describing the relation of response to stimulus,““An induction shock produces a contraction or fails to do so according to its strength; if it does so at all, it produces the greatest contraction that can be produced by any strength of stimulus in the condition of the muscle at the time.”The individual fibres of both skeletal muscle and nerve respond to stimulation according to the all-or-none principle.\n\nThe magnitude of the action potential set up in any single nerve fibre is independent of the strength of the exciting stimulus, provided the latter is adequate. An electrical stimulus below threshold strength fails to elicit a propagated spike potential. If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fibre does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fibre is termed the all-or-none relationship. This relationship holds only for the unit of tissue; for nervous tissue the unit is the nerve cell, for skeletal muscle the unit is the individual muscle fiber and for the heart the unit is the entire auricles or the entire ventricles.\n\nStimuli too weak to produce a spike do, however, set up a local electrotonus, the magnitude of the electronic potential progressively increasing with the strength of the stimulus, until a spike is generated. This demonstrates the all-or-none relationship in spike production.\n\nThe above account deals with the response of a single nerve fibre. If a nerve trunk is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above a threshold, a larger number of fibres respond. The minimal effective (i.e., threshold) stimulus is adequate only for fibres of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibres. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve.\n\nHeart muscle is excitable, i.e., it responds to external stimuli by contracting. If the external stimulus is too weak, no response is obtained; if the stimulus is adequate, the heart responds to the best of its ability. Accordingly, the auricles or ventricles behave as a single unit, so that an adequate stimulus normally produces a full contraction of either the auricles or ventricles. The force of the contraction obtained depends on the state in which the muscles fibres find themselves. In the case of muscle fibres, the individual muscle fibre does not respond at all if the stimulus is too weak. However, it responds maximally when the stimulus rises to threshold. The contraction is not increased if the stimulus strength is further raised. Stronger stimuli bring more muscle fibres into action and thus the tension of a muscle increases as the strength of the stimulus applied to it rises.\n"}
{"id": "3175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3175", "title": "Antinomy", "text": "Antinomy\n\nAntinomy (Greek ἀντί, \"antí\", \"against, in opposition to\", and νόμος, \"nómos\", \"law\") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws. It is a term used in logic and epistemology, particularly in the philosophy of Kant.\n\nThere are many examples of antinomy. A self-contradictory phrase such as \"There is no absolute truth\" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. A paradox such as \"this sentence is false\" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.\n\nThe term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or experience (phenomena). Empirical reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which transcends it.\n\nFor Kant there are four antinomies, connected with:\n\nIn each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. For example: in the first antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by \"successive synthesis\"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been \"empty time\" out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason: Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.\n\nThis was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to science and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between phenomena and noumena). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.\n\nKant is not the only philosopher to employ the term, however. Another famous use of antinomy is by Karl Marx, in Capital Volume One, in the chapter entitled 'The Working Day'. On Marx's account, capitalist production sustains 'the assertion of a right to an unlimited working day, and the assertion of a right to a limited working day, both with equal justification'. Furner emphasizes that the thesis and antithesis of this antinomy are not contradictory opposites, but rather 'consist in the assertion of rights to states of affairs that are contradictory opposites'. \n\n\n"}

It is used both to discuss the experience of reality and also basic human virtue.\n\nIn his 1980 Seminary he associates this term with both absolute bodhicitta and specifically the Tibetan term kun.gzhi.ngang.lugs.kyi.dge.ba which comes from the Kadam tradition and refers to the natural virtues of the kunshi or alaya. Specifically he described three virtues: \"unborn\" meaning non-manufactured; \"nondwelling\" meaning that it cannot be pinned down, and \"free from pigeonholing\" meaning that it is beyond conceptual reference points. In his 1981 Seminary he described it as also referring to personal wholesomeness and dedication to others.\n\nMelvin McLeod explains the term with \"basic\" indicating the primordial, self-existing nature and \"goodness\" indicating a faultless aspect. John Miller associated the term with Buddha-nature.\n\nTrungpa Rinpoche's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, expressed the relationship between basic goodness and enlightened society in these words: \"In essence, the emphasis of the Buddhist path is to help us attain enlightenment, and the emphasis of the Shambhala path is to help us create and maintain a good society. When we put these two together, we have the Shambhalian Buddhist view of enlightened society. Thus the two paths work in tandem, not in competition.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "509342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509342", "title": "Boston Brahmin", "text": "Boston Brahmin\n\nThe Boston Brahmin or Boston elite are members of Boston's traditional upper class. They form an integral part of the historic core of the East Coast establishment, along with other wealthy families of Philadelphia and New York City. They are often associated with the distinctive Boston Brahmin accent, Harvard University, Anglicanism and traditional Anglo-American customs and clothing. Descendants of the earliest English colonists, such as those who came to America on the \"Mayflower\" or the \"Arbella\", are often considered to be the most representative of the Boston Brahmins.\n\nThe term was coined by the physician and writer Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., in an 1860 article in the \"Atlantic Monthly\". The term \"Brahmin\" refers to the highest ranking caste of people in the traditional Hindu caste system in India. In the United States, it has been applied to the old, wealthy New England families of British Protestant origin which were influential in the development of American institutions and culture.\n\nThe term effectively underscores the strong conviction of the New England gentry that they were a people set apart by destiny to guide the American experiment as their ancestors had played a leading role in founding it. The term also illustrates the erudite and exclusive nature of the New England gentry as perceived by outsiders, and may also refer to their interest in Eastern religions, fostered perhaps by the impact in the 19th century of the transcendentalist writings of New England literary icons such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, and the enlightened appeal of Universalist Unitarian movements of the same period.\n\nThe nature of the Brahmins is hinted at by the doggerel \"Boston Toast\" by Holy Cross alumnus John Collins Bossidy:\nWhile some 19th-century Brahmin families of large fortune were of bourgeois origin, still fewer were of a somewhat aristocratic origin. The new families were often the first to seek, in typically British fashion, suitable marriage alliances with those old aristocratic New England families that were descended from landowners in England to elevate and cement their social standing. The Winthrops, Dudleys, Saltonstalls, Winslows, and Lymans (descended from English magistrates, gentry, and aristocracy) were, by and large, happy with this arrangement. All of Boston's \"Brahmin elite\", therefore, maintained the received culture of the old English gentry, including cultivating the personal excellence that they imagined maintained the distinction between gentlemen and freemen, and between ladies and women. They saw it as their duty to maintain what they defined as high standards of excellence, duty, and restraint. Cultivated, urbane, and dignified, a Boston Brahmin was supposed to be the very essence of enlightened aristocracy. The ideal Brahmin was not only wealthy, but displayed what was considered suitable personal virtues and character traits.\n\nThe Brahmin was expected to maintain the customary English reserve in his dress, manner, and deportment, cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against avarice and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs, and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists. Politically they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans. They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution, the Boston Brahmin accent, a version of the New England accent. Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as preppy. Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy and fellows of the Royal Society of London (a leading scientific body), while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.\n\nAdams Family \n\nAmory Family\n\nAppleton Family\n\nPatrilineal line:\n\nOther notable relatives:\n\nBacon Family\n\n\nBates family\n\nOriginally from Boston and Britain:\n\nBoylston Family\n\n\nBradlee Family\n\nDirect line:\n\n\nChaffee Family\n\nOriginally of Hingham, Massachusetts:\n\nChoate Family\n\nCoffin Family\n\nOriginally of Newbury and Nantucket:\n\n\n\n\nCrowninshield Family\n\nDescendants by marriage:\n\nCushing Family\n\nOriginally of Hingham, Massachusetts:\n\nDescendant by marriage:\n\nDana Family\n\nDelano Family\n\nDudley Family\n\nDwight Family\n\nEliot Family\n\nEmerson Family\n\nEndicott Family\n\nSalem:\n\nDedham:\n\n\nOf Marblehead and Salem:\n\nForbes Family\n\nGardner Family\n\nOriginally of Essex county:\n\n\n\nHolmes Family\n\nJackson Family\n\nLawrence Family\nDescendant by marriage: Abbott Lawrence Lowell (1856–1943): president of Harvard University\n\nLodge Family\n\n\nMinot Family\n\nNorcross Family\n\nOriginal from Watertown, Massachusetts\n\nOtis Family\n\nPalfrey Family\n\nParkman Family\n\nPeabody Family\n\nPerkins Family\n\nPhillips Family\n\nOther notable relatives:\n\nPutnam Family\n\nQuincy Family\n\nRice Family\n\nOriginally of Sudbury, Massachusetts:\n\nSaltonstall Family\n\n\nSears Family\n\nTarbox Family\n\n\nThayer Family\n\nThorndike Family\n\nTudor Family\n\n\nWeld Family\n\nWigglesworth Family\n\nWinthrop Family\n\n"}

{"id": "50565308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50565308", "title": "Christmas gift", "text": "Christmas gift\n\nA Christmas gift or Christmas present is a gift given in celebration of Christmas. Christmas gifts are often exchanged on December 25.\n\nThe tradition of gift-giving is an old one, but it became associated with Christmas more recently. It is a relic of a pagan custom, namely, the winter solstice which in Europe occurs in December. This was celebrated in ancient Rome with gift-giving during the Saturnalia holiday, which took place that month. As Christianity became increasingly widespread in the Roman lands, the custom of gift-giving continued. Around the year 336 AD the date of December 25 appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth, and the tradition of gift-giving was reinterpreted and tied to the story of three Magi giving gifts to baby Jesus; together with another story, that of Santa Claus based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver, it slowly became a part of Christmas celebrations. \n\nSome early Christian rulers, however, interpreted this story as indications that it should be their subjects who should give gifts to their superiors, and insisted on tributes and tithes during that period. This changed around the turn of the millennium following the popularity of the Good King Wenceslas story based on the life of another historical person claimed to be a gift-giver, Saint Wenceslaus. Christmas gift-giving to superiors became less common, and around the time of the Protestant Reformation, customs of gift-giving to children became increasingly widespread in Europe. The custom spread to the United States around the 19th century. This also coincided with the desire of some elites to reduce the rowdiness of adult Christmas celebrations, which in some places were tied to begging, as \"bands of young men, often rowdy, would \"wassail\" from home to home and demand handouts from the gentry\". Another related aspect was the growing desire by parents to keep children at home, away from the \"corrupting\" influence of the urban streets. \n\nAnother relatively recent change concerned the time of Christmas gift-giving. For many centuries, gift-giving took place on December 6 around Saint Nicholas Day or in early January after New Year's Eve. The popularity of this custom grew after the positive reception of the 1823 poem \"The Night Before Christmas\" and the 1843 novella \"A Christmas Carol\". By the end of the 19th century, Christmas Eve replaced early December or January dates as the most common date for gift-giving in the Western culture. It is custom for one to open a single gift on the evening of Christmas Eve.\n\nThe tradition was also embraced by retailers, for whom the weeks and, eventually, the entire month before Christmas became a very profitable period. Around the turn of the 20th century retailers started directing marketing efforts at children in the hopes that they would entice the parents to buy more goods.\n\nIn the early 2000s it was estimated that shoppers in the U.S. alone spend over $4 billion each day during the Christmas shopping season, with an average individual spending over $1,000 on gifts. \n\nThere are concerns that gift-giving during Christmas is too commercial. Seventy percent of respondents to an online survey of 13,576 people in 14 European countries in 2016 said that too much attention is put on spending during the Christmas period, 42% said they felt forced to spend more at Christmas, and 10% borrowed money to be able to afford the gifts.\n\nEconomist Joel Waldfogel noted that because of the mismatch between what the giftee values the gift and the value paid for by the giver, the gifts lose between 10% to one-third of their value; he calls it the \"deadweight loss of Christmas\". This leads to gifts often being returned, sold, or re-gifted. In the 2016 European online survey, 15% of respondents were unhappy about their gifts and 10% could not remember what they had received. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they had re-gifted their presents to someone else, 14% sold the items, 10% tried to return them to the store, and 5% returned the gift to the giver. Seniors were more likely to send their unwanted presents to charity, while those aged 25 to 34 \"simply threw them away\". Gifts that are least likely to be appreciated rely on personal tastes, and include items like perfumes and cosmetics, ornaments, and clothing.\n\n\nsongs:\n"}

Scientists believed that they would be able to control the micro black holes once created but Peter Ansay, a young genius in quantum physics thought differently.

Peter's report was rejected by CERN and his credibility as a scientist was destroyed. On 23 September 2012, Peter breaks into the CERN laboratories to gain access to the Collider and sabotage it preventing any future experiments. But something goes wrong in a way that Peter couldn't have predicted, and he is transported to 2018 by a wormhole to a world destroyed by natural disasters and at war with the Unknown. He wakes up in a strangely familiar place, convinced he's somehow been there before.

{"id": "13923102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13923102", "title": "Criteria of truth", "text": "Criteria of truth\n\nIn epistemology, criteria of truth (or tests of truth) are standards and rules used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims. They are tools of verification. Understanding a philosophy's criteria of truth is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of logic have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from falsehood. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.\n\nThe criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public. Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three functional, effective tests of truth. He lists these as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic theories of truth.\n\nThe opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of proof. Their knowledge and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to expert testimony, it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.\n\nCoherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the human inability to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an omniscient mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.\n\nSome view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to \"consensus gentium\", the universal consent of all mankind, all humans holding a distinct belief proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and mathematics. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held the earth was flat and that the sun revolved about the earth.\n\nMere consistency is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a necessary condition for the truth of any argument, owing to the law of noncontradiction. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.\n\nStrict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. Formal logic and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are \"a priori\" (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system.\n\nCorrespondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid \"definition\" of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this \"definition\" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in objective reality.\n\nMost people consciously or unknowingly employ custom as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is popular. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.\n\nMany people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting emotions as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such subjective judgments when evaluating knowledge. Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence.\n\nThe existence of distinct instincts has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.\n\nIntuition is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a rational examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel \"right\". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.\n\nMajority rule is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In democratic systems, majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal morality and social behavior. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere plurality. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of \"consensus gentium\".\n\nNaïve realism posits that only that which is directly observable by the human senses is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of sounds beyond the range of human hearing and the existence of x-rays. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.\n\nIf an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its truth value upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although Pragmatism is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form William Ernest Hocking called \"Negative Pragmatism\". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.\n\nThe principal distinction between intuition and revelation is that revelation has an assumed source: God (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many religions fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.\n\nTime is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as \"the test of time\". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its validity. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. vitalism). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.\n\nTradition, closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over critical evaluation.\n"}

The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the \"hostile witness\" and the \"uncritical lover\" whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept.\n\nThis dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister Peter Kilfoyle MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister Tony Blair and he chose to resign from Government, Hansard quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a \"critical friend\" of the Government. \n\nHe was misquoted in the \"Daily Telegraph\" as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a \"candid friend\" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle \"The Guardian\" newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Coventry City Council, Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,\n"}

It can broadly be defined as \"changes introduced into a system that adversely affect its current or future performance\". Damage \"does not necessarily imply total loss of system functionality, but rather that the system is no longer operating in its optimal manner\". Damage to physical objects is \"the progressive physical process by which they break\", and includes mechanical stress that weakens a structure, even if this is not visible.\n\nAll physical damage begins on the atomic level, with the shifting or breaking of atomic bonds, and the rate at which damage to any physical thing occurs is therefore largely dependent on the elasticity of such bonds in the material being subjected to stress. Damage can occur where atomic bonds are not completely broken, but are shifted to create unstable pockets of concentration and diffusion of the material, which are more susceptible to later breakage. The effect of outside forces on a material depends on the relative elasticity or plasticity of the material; if a material tends towards elasticity, then changes to its consistency are reversible, and it can bounce back from potential damage. However, if the material tends towards plasticity, then such changes are permanent, and each such change increases the possibility of a crack or fault appearing in the material.\n\nAlthough all damage at the atomic level manifests as broken atomic bonds, the manifestation of damage at the macroscopic level depends on the material, and can include cracks and deformation, as well as structural weakening that is not visible.\n\nDamage to structures and other objects can take a number of forms, such as fire damage caused by the effects of burning, water damage done by water to materials not resistant to its effects, and radiation damage due to ionizing radiation. Some kinds of damage are specific to vehicles and mechanical or electronic systems, such as foreign object damage caused by the presence of any foreign substance, debris, or article; hydrogen damage due to interactions between metals and hydrogen; and damage mechanics, which includes damage to materials due to cyclic mechanical loads. When an object has been damaged, it may be possible to repair the object, thereby restoring it to its original condition, or to a new condition that allows it to function despite the damage.\n\nDamage to a living organism may be referred to as an injury. The kinds of damage experienced by living things range from microscopic direct DNA damage and cell damage in a biological cell, to damage to larger systems such as nerve damage, brain damage, and articular cartilage damage. Damage to the body on a larger scale is often referred to as trauma. Ageing is accompanied by a loss of ability to recover quickly from various kinds of biological damage. Damage is one of two factors proposed to influence biological ageing (the other being programmed factors follow a biological timetable). Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce cumulative damage at various levels.\n\nDamage that occurs as an unintended consequence of an effort to cause intentional damage elsewhere, such as with a military operation, is called collateral damage, while damage specifically done to public or private property is called property damage. By extension, damage is also used to describe a degradation in the value of intangible things such as relationships, self-image, reputation, and goodwill.\n\nThe propensity for damage to occur to physical objects and systems, as well as to intangible characteristics, is built into the prices of goods and services that depend on the supply of these things, particularly as a component of insurance costs. In law, damages are the award, typically of money, to be paid to a person as compensation for loss or injury (i.e., economic or physical damage).\n\nInstitutional damage is broadly defined as unintended consequences to an individual resulting from interaction with an institution which has responsibility for his or her care. The individual might be a hospital patient, a child in a school, or a prison inmate. Some forms of institutional damage, such as medical errors and hospital-acquired infection are relatively easily measured; others, such as long-term damage to development and mental health are significantly harder to measure. There is controversy as to whether such damage can be measured and if it actually occurs.\n\nIt is not a widely used term, however, but it is a legal concept of considerable importance, because it is extremely common, particularly in countries where human rights of prisoners and other people under institutional care are not respected or guaranteed by law.\n\nConstitutional law, civil law (common law) and criminal law codices have many provisions to protect individuals against injuries caused by institutions to which they are unwillingly committed. The extent and the respect to these laws vary widely among countries and communities. These controversies relate to the old government versus individual debate which has permeated philosophy and political science since Ancient Greece.\n\nThe same expression is also used in the opposite sense, i.e., as damage caused to institutions, as opposed to damage caused to individuals. For example, political exception situations, such as the suspension of political rights for a time, are said to damage democratic institutions. Other examples are vandalism of public buildings, extremely large epidemics that disrupt normal functioning of society's institutions, such as in the case of AIDS in Africa; external military intervention, such as in the invasion of Iraq by the USA and allied nations; and even (paradoxically), external aid to countries which are rich in natural resources but have a poor economy and/or corrupt government (the so-called \"resource curse\")\n\nThe two concepts, damage caused by institutions and damage caused to institutions, are related in many situations. In widespread political trials (\"witch hunting\") in democratic countries, such as in the famous House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1940s, damage was said to occur in both directions, i.e., not only the lives, families and professional activities of a number of individuals were wrecked by the public exposure, but also the political institutions of individual rights and freedom in the United States were also similarly damaged by the Committee's activities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42486408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42486408", "title": "Death and adjustment hypotheses", "text": "Death and adjustment hypotheses\n\nDeath and adjustment hypotheses (DAH) is a theory about death and dying that focuses on death anxiety (psychology) and adjustment to death. It was presented by Mohammad Samir Hossain as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death. In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.\n\nThe theory was first promoted in the book \"Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\" in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, \"Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated\", was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal \"Death Studies\" and Royal College of Psychiatrists reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry. After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the Royal College of Psychiatrists at London published the theory itself as the short article \"Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\" and the Taylor & Francis publication \"Journal of Loss and Trauma\" did the same in its article \"Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses\".\n\nHossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.\n\nFactors behind the DAH are described in \"European Psychiatry\", Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –\n\n\"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing\n1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, \n2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and \n3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. \nIntegrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral\nimplications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the \"death adjustment hypotheses,\" would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology.\"\n\nFinding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety. There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases. It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.\n\nDeath anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a \"feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’\". It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from necrophobia, which is a specific fear of dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying). DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.\n\nIt is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes, pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.\n\nHossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.\n\nAs outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:\n\n\n\n"}

(A double groupoid can also be considered as a generalization of certain higher-dimensional groups.) The geometry of squares and their compositions leads to a common representation of a \"double groupoid\" in the following diagram:\n\nwhere M is a set of 'points', H and V are, respectively, 'horizontal' and 'vertical' groupoids, and S is a set of 'squares' with two compositions. The composition laws for a double groupoid D make it also describable as a groupoid internal to the category of groupoids.\n\nGiven two groupoids H and V over a set M, there is a double groupoid formula_1 with H,V as horizontal and vertical edge groupoids, and squares given by quadruples\n\nfor which one assumes always that h, h′ are in H and v, v′ are in V, and that the initial and final points of these edges match in M as suggested by the notation; that is for example sh = sv, th = sv', ..., etc. The compositions are to be inherited from those of H,V; that is:\n\nand\n\nThis construction is the right adjoint to the forgetful functor which takes the double groupoid as above, to the pair of groupoids H,V over M.\n\nOther related constructions are that of a double groupoid with connection and homotopy double groupoids. The homotopy double groupoid of a pair of pointed spaces is a key element of the proof of a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, first proved by Brown and Higgins in 1978, and given an extensive treatment in the book.\n\nA generalisation to dimension 2 of the fundamental groupoid on a set of base was given by Brown and Higgins in 1978 as follows. Let formula_5 be a triple of spaces, i.e. formula_6. Define formula_7 to be the set of homotopy classes rel vertices of maps of a square into X which take the edges into A and the vertices into C. It is not entirely trivial to prove that the natural compositions of such squares in two directions are inherited by these homotopy classes to give a double groupoid, which also has an extra structure of so-called connections necessary to discuss the idea of commutative cube in a double groupoid. This double groupoid is used in an essential way to prove a two-dimensional Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which gives new information and computations on second relative homotopy groups as part of a crossed module. For more information, see Part I of the book by Brown, Higgins, Sivera listed below.\n\nA \"convolution C*-algebra\" of a double groupoid can also be constructed by employing the square diagram D of a double groupoid.\n\nThe category whose objects are double groupoids and whose morphisms are double groupoid homomorphisms that are double groupoid diagram (D) functors is called the double groupoid category, or the category of double groupoids.\n\n"}
{"id": "40494939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40494939", "title": "Ecofeminism", "text": "Ecofeminism\n\nThe term Ecofeminism is used to describe a feminist approach to understanding ecology. Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of gender to theorize on the relationship between humans and the natural world. The term was coined by the French writer Françoise d'Eaubonne in her book \"Le Féminisme ou la Mort\" (1974). Today, there are many interpretations of ecofeminism and how it might be applied to social thought, including: ecofeminist art, ecofeminist theory, social justice and political philosophy, religion, contemporary feminism and poetry. As there are several different types of feminism and different beliefs held by feminists, there are different versions of ecofeminism.\n\nEcofeminism is widely referred to as the third wave of feminism, it adds to the former feminist theory that an environmental perspective is a necessary part of feminism. Ecofeminism uses the parallels between the oppression of nature and the oppression of women as a way to highlight the idea that both must be understood in order to properly recognize how they are connected. These parallels include but are not limited to seeing women and nature as property, seeing men as the curators of culture and women as the curators of nature, and how men dominate women and humans dominate nature.\n\nCharlene Spretnak has offered one way of categorizing ecofeminist work: 1) through the study of political theory as well as history; 2) through the belief and study of nature-based religions; 3) through environmentalism.\n\nAccording to Françoise d'Eaubonne in her book \"Le Féminisme ou la Mort\" (1974, Ecofeminism relates the oppression and domination of all subordinate groups (women, people of color, children, the poor) to the oppression and domination of nature (animals, land, water, air, etc.). In the book, the author argues that oppression, domination, exploitation, and colonization from the Western patriarchal society has directly caused irreversible environmental damage. Françoise d'Eaubonne was an activist and organizer, and her writing encouraged the eradication of all social injustice, not just injustice against women and the environment.\n\nThis tradition includes a number of influential texts including: \"Women and Nature\" (Susan Griffin 1978), \"The Death of Nature\" (Carolyn Merchant 1980) and \"Gyn/Ecology\" (Mary Daly 1978). These texts helped to propel the association between domination by man on women and the domination of culture on nature. From these texts feminist activism of the 1980s linked ideas of ecology and the environment. For example, conferences for women devoted to living on the earth and protests against nuclear testing and other militarism that oppresses femininity. Writing in this circle discussed ecofeminism drawing from Green Party politics, peace movements, and direct action movements.\n\nModern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.\n\nOne ecofeminist theory is that capitalist values reflect paternalistic and gendered values. In this interpretation effects of capitalism has led to a harmful split between nature and culture. In the 1970s, early ecofeminists discussed that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for nurture and holistic knowledge of nature's processes.\n\nSeveral feminists make the distinction that it is not \"because\" women are female or \"feminine\" that they relate to nature, but because of their similar states of oppression by the same male-dominant forces. The marginalization is evident in the gendered language used to describe nature and the animalized language used to describe women. Some discourses link women specifically to the environment because of their traditional social role as a nurturer and caregiver. Ecofeminists following in this line of thought believe that these connections are illustrated through the coherence of socially-labeled values associated with 'femininity' such as nurturing, which are present both among women and in nature.\n\nVandana Shiva says that women have a special connection to the environment through their daily interactions and this connection has been ignored. She says that women in subsistence economies who produce \"wealth in partnership with nature, have been experts in their own right of holistic and ecological knowledge of nature's processes\". She makes the point that \"these alternative modes of knowing, which are oriented to the social benefits and sustenance needs are not recognized by the capitalist reductionist paradigm, because it fails to perceive the interconnectedness of nature, or the connection of women's lives, work and knowledge with the creation of wealth (23)\".  Shiva blames this failure on the West's patriarchy, and the patriarchal idea of what development is. According to Shiva, patriarchy has labeled women, nature, and other groups not growing the economy as \"unproductive\".\n\nIn the 1993 essay entitled \"Ecofeminism: Toward Global Justice and Planetary Health\" authors Greta Gaard and Lori Gruen outline what they call the \"ecofeminist framework\". The essay provides a wealth of data and statistics in addition to laying out the theoretical aspects of the ecofeminist critique. The framework described is intended to establish ways of viewing and understanding our current global situations so that we are better able to understand how we arrived at this point and what may be done to ameliorate the ills.\n\nGaard and Gruen argue that there are four sides to this framework:\n\n\nThey hold that these four factors have brought us to what ecofeminists see as a \"separation between nature and culture\" that is the root source of our planetary ills.\n\nIn \"Ecofeminism\" (1993) authors Vandana Shiva, Maria Mies and Evan Bondi ponder modern science and its acceptance as a universal and value-free system. Instead, they view the dominant stream of modern science as a projection of Western men's values. The privilege of determining what is considered scientific knowledge has been controlled by men, and for the most part of history restricted to men. Bondi and Miles list examples including the medicalization of childbirth and the industrialization of plant reproduction.\n\nBondi argues that the medicalization of childbirth has marginalized midwife knowledge and changed the natural process of childbirth into a procedure dependent on specialized technologies and appropriated expertise.\nA common claim within ecofeminist literature is that patriarchal structures justify their dominance through binary opposition, these include but are not limited to: heaven/earth, mind/body, male/female, human/animal, spirit/matter, culture/nature and white/non-white. Oppression is reinforced by assuming truth in these binaries and instilling them as 'marvelous to behold' through religious and scientific constructs.\n\nThe application of ecofeminism to animal rights has established vegetarian ecofeminism, which asserts that \"omitting the oppression of animals from feminist and ecofeminist analyses […] is inconsistent with the activist and philosophical foundations of both feminism (as a \"movement to end all forms of oppression\") and ecofeminism.\" It puts into practice \"the personal is political\" for it believes that \"meat-eating is a form of patriarchal domination…that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet.\" Vegetarian ecofeminism combines sympathy with the analysis of culture and politics to refine a system of ethics and action.\n\nEcofeminism as materialist is another common theme in ecofeminism. A materialist view connects some institutions such as labor, power and property as the source of domination over women and nature. There are connections made between these subjects because similarly there are varying values in production and reproduction.\n\nSpiritual ecofeminism is another branch of ecofeminism, and is popular among ecofeminist authors such as Starhawk, Riane Eisler, Carol J. Adams, and more. Starhawk calls this an earth-based spirituality, which recognizes that the Earth is alive, that we are interconnected, as well as a community. Spiritual ecofeminism is not linked to one specific religion, but is centered around values of caring, compassion, and non-violence. Often, ecofeminists refer to more ancient traditions, such as the worship of Gaia, the Goddess of nature and spirituality (also known as Mother Earth).\n\nBuddhism\n\nBuddhism and feminism simultaneously gained momentum in America during the 1960s. Some of the parallels between these movements include their experiential epistemology, the intersection of the constrained mind, intersectionality and connection, using emotional energy as a coping mechanism, relational ethics, and a communal mindset and lifestyle. Both Buddhist and ecofeminist practitioners viewed nature as a pathway to enlightenment and as a source of many jumping off points for introspection and deeper thought about the relationship of nature and humans.\n\nJudaism\n\nJewish ideology emphasizes leaving the earth as it was found (or in better condition than it was found in). This concept is also promoted through ecofeminist theories and movements. Both Judaism and ecofeminism do not always present as social justice movements, but they often contribute ideals and motivations for social change. Social justice is an important part of Judaism, and many practitioners see social justice as a form of spirituality, and some feel this form of spirituality through environmental and feminist movements.\n\nHinduism\n\nIn Hinduism, the Ganges River is personified by the Goddess Ganga. She is a paradoxical deity, as she is supposed to be independent yet guarded, pure yet polluted. Ganga is referred to as a deity to be both subjugated and protected. The underlying tone of the passages is patriarchal despite being reverent. The pollution or purity of the Ganges river is a reflection on Ganga, which represents the relationship between spirituality and nature. Hinduism emphasizes that all lives are connected and indistinguishable. In this context, every life, be it human or animal, is important.\n\nWomen participated in the environmental movements, specifically preservation and conservation beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing into the early twentieth century.\n\nIn northern India in 1973, women took part in the Chipko movement to protect forests from deforestation. Non-violent protest tactics were used to occupy trees so that loggers could not cut them down.\n\nIn Kenya in 1977, the Green Belt Movement was initiated by Professor Wangari Maathai, environmental and political activist, and is ongoing today. It is rural tree planting program led by women, which Maathai designed to help prevent desertification in the area. The program created a 'green belt' of at least 1,000 trees around villages, and gives participants the ability to take charge in their communities. In later years, the Green Belt Movement was an advocate for informing and empowering citizens through seminars for civic and environmental education, as well as holding national leaders accountable for their actions and instilling agency in citizens.\n\nIn 1978 in New York, mother and environmentalist Lois Gibbs led her community in protest after discovering that their entire neighborhood, Love Canal, was built on top of a toxic dump site. The toxins in the ground were causing illness among children and reproductive issues among women, as well as birth defects in babies born to pregnant women exposed to the toxins. The Love Canal movement eventually led to the evacuation and relocation of nearly 800 families by the federal government.\n\nIn 1980 and 1981, members of such a conference organized a peaceful protest at the Pentagon. Women stood, hand in hand, demanding equal rights (including social, economic, and reproductive rights) as well as an end to militaristic actions taken by the government and exploitation of the community (people and the environment). This movement is known as the Women's Pentagon Actions.\n\nIn 1985, the Akwesasne Mother's Milk Project was launched by Katsi Cook. This study was funded by the government, and investigated how the higher level of contaminants in water near the Mohawk reservation impacted babies. It revealed that through breast milk, Mohawk children were being exposed to 200% more toxins than children not on the reservation. Toxins contaminate water all over the world, but to due environmental racism, certain subversive groups are exposed to a much higher amount.\n\nThe Greening of Harlem Coalition is another example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is responsible for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities to be in touch with nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.\n\nThe development of vegetarian ecofeminism can be traced to the mid-80s and 90s, where it first appeared in writing. However, the roots of a vegetarian ecofeminist view can be traced back further by looking at sympathy for non-humans and counterculture movements of the 1960s and 1970s. At the culmination of the decade ecofeminism had spread to both coasts and articulated an intersectional analysis of women and the environment. Eventually, challenging ideas of environmental classism and racism, resisting toxic dumping and other threats to the impoverished.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s some began to see the advancing theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This dichotomy is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism is trying to break. Out of this critique rose the anti-essentialist argument. Ecofeminist and author Noel Sturgeon says in an interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing is a strategy used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.\n\nComing out of the 90s, ecofeminism met a lot of criticism from anti-essentialist feminism, which heavily critiqued what they viewed as essentialism. The essentialist view saw ecofeminism as reinforcing and growing patriarchal dominance and norms. Feminist thoughts surrounding ecofeminism grew in some areas as it was criticized; vegetarian ecofeminism contributed intersectional analysis; and ecofeminisms that analyzed animal rights, labor rights and activisms as they could draw lines among oppressed groups. To some, the inclusion of non-human animals also became to be viewed as essentialist. According to ecofeminist and author Charlene Spretnak, modern ecofeminism is concerned about a variety of issues, including reproductive technology, equal pay and equal rights, toxic poisoning, Third World development, and more.\n\nEcofeminism as it propelled into the 21st century became aware of the criticisms, and in response ecofeminists with a materialist lens began doing research and renaming the topic, i.e. queer ecologies, global feminist environmental justice, and gender and the environment.\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, women worked in efforts to protect wildlife, food, air and water. These efforts depended largely on new developments in the environmental movement from influential writers, such as Henry David Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, and Rachel Carson. Fundamental examples of women's efforts in the 20th century are the books \"Silent Spring\" by Rachel Carson and \"Refuge\" by Terry Tempest Williams. These works truly opened American's eyes to the environmental harm they were perpetuating, and created a platform for change.\n\nEcofeminist author Karren Warren lists Aldo Leopold's essay \"Land Ethic\" (1949) as a fundamental work to the ecofeminist conception, as Leopold was the first to pen an ethic for the land which understands all non-human parts of that community (animals, plants, land, air, water) as equal to and in a relationship with humans. This inclusive understanding of the environment launched the modern preservation movement and illustrated how issues can be viewed through a framework of caring.\n\nSusan A. Mann an eco-feminist and professor of sociological and feminist theory considers the roles women played in these activisms to be the starter for ecofeminism in later centuries. Mann associates the beginning of ecofeminism not with feminists but with women of different race and class backgrounds who made connections among gender, race, class and environmental issues. This ideal is upheld through the notion that in activist and theory circles marginalized groups must be included in the discussion. In early environmental and women's movements, issues of varying races and classes were often separated.\n\nThe major criticism of ecofeminism is that it is essentialist. The ascribed essentialism appears in two main areas:\n\n\nSocial ecologist and feminist Janet Biehl has criticized ecofeminism for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature and not enough on the actual conditions of women. She has also stated that rather than being a forward-moving theory, ecofeminism is an anti-progressive movement for women.\n\nRosemary Radford Ruether also critiques this focus on mysticism over work that focuses on helping women, but argues that spirituality and activism can be combined effectively in ecofeminism.\n\nA.E. Kings has criticized ecofeminism for limiting itself to focusing only on gender and the environment, and neglecting to take an intersectional approach.

Since the collapse of the East German political regime in 1989/90 he has participated prominently on committees and as an author seeking to understand and evaluate it.\n\nNeubert was born into the family of a Protestant minister in 1940 in Herschdorf, a hillside village near Erfurt in central southern Germany. He grew up in nearby . Between 1958 and 1963 he studied Theology at Jena. After 1964 he worked at initially as a vicar and later as the minister in charge for the parish. From 1973 he was combining his parish duties with work as a at nearby Weimar. In 1976, probably on the advice of Robert Havemann, he joined the CDU, in western Germany a political party of the moderate right, but in the politically and by this time physically separated eastern German state, one of the so-called \"block parties\" controlled by the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\"/SED) party through an organisation known as the National Front (\"Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik\"/NF). In 1984 Neubert resigned from the CDU. In 1984 he became community sociology secretary in the Theology Studies department with the Berlin-based .\n\nFrom 1967 Ehrhart Neubert was also taking part in various informal discussion groups, focusing on theology, sociology and the interface between them. He was sympathetic to the civil right demands of Robert Havemann, who was seen by the regime as a high-profile political dissident. By 1979 Neubert was participating actively in Peace Groups of the and, during then 1980s, in other peace circles. He found himself increasingly in conflict both with the state authorities and with the inherently collaborationist leaderships of the official evangelical churches which were keen to retain a level of recognition and toleration from the party leadership. Neubert also produced a number of quasi-political sociological and theological studies: some of his work appeared in West Germany under the pseudonym \"Christian Joachim\".\n\nDuring East Germany's Peaceful Revolution, Neubert was a co-founder of the Democratic Awakening movement, founded in 1989 in his apartment. He contributed to the new party's programme and served as its first vice-chairman. He represented Democratic Awakening at several of the East German Round Table sessions and served on various related investigatory commissions. A (relatively) young fellow activist in Democratic Awakening was Angela Merkel who later became Chancellor of Germany. Finding himself out of sympathy with what he saw at the time a shift towards the political right, in January 1990 Neubert resigned from Democratic Awakening. The crunch issue appears to have been the issue of its developing political alliances, notably with the CDU (party): Merkel stayed. After reunification, which formally took place in the late summer of 1990, in 1992 he became a member of the Brandenburg branch of the Alliance 90 (political party).\n\nIn 1976 the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) had attempted, without success, to recruit Neubert: sixteen years later, as a member of the \"Law and reconciliation\" initiative Neubert stood up for the rights of Stasi victims and for fair and consistent treatment of those involved in the endlessly complex interactions of the Stasi and the Protestant churches in former East Germany. In 1992 the Alliance 90 group in the Brandenburg Landtag (\"regional parliament\") nominated him as a member of the Stolpe inquiry committee. The committee concluded its work in 1994 (although many of the matters it investigated would not be so quickly laid to rest). In 1996 Ehrhart Neubart (re)joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (\"Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands\"/CDU party). That same year, at the age of 46, he received his doctorate from the Free University of Berlin for a dissertation on the history of political opposition in the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1989. In 1998 the work was published, repackaged into a volume of approximately 1000 pages.\n\nIn 1997 Neubert took a post with the Stasi Records Agency (\"Bundesbeauftragten für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik\"/BStU), taking charge of the agency's research and education department. Together with the agency's commissioner of the time, Joachim Gauck, Neubert compiled the German contribution to the German-language version of The Black Book of Communism, writing the chapter entitled \"Politische Verbrechen in der DDR\" (\"Political Crimes in East Germany\"). Elsewhere he has made numerous further written contributions on resistance and opposition, and the position of religious people and institutions, in former East Germany. In 1998 he was co-opted as a board member of the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship (\"Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur\"). By this time he had already become, in 1996, a founding member of the \"Bürgerbüro (Verein)Bürgerbüro - Verein zur Aufarbeitung von Folgeschäden der SED-Diktatur\", a Berlin-based organisation established to provide practical and psychological advice and support for victims of East Germany's Socialist Unity Party version of socialism, subsequently becoming the organisation's president on the death of Bärbel Bohley.\n\nErhart Neubert retired in 2005, but still fills in as a Lutheran minister in the area. He married in 1987: she shares his background as an East German opposition activist with evangelical church connections, also sharing his commitment since 1990 to researching and recording the dictatorship. More recently she served for ten years as a regional commissioner for Stasi documents in Thuringia.\n"}

It is the totality of things relevant to some subject matter. Without expressed or implied limits, it may refer to anything. The Universe is everything that exists theoretically, though a multiverse may exist according to theoretical cosmology predictions. It may refer to an anthropocentric worldview, or the sum of human experience, history, and the human condition in general. Every object and entity is a part of everything, including all physical bodies and in some cases all abstract objects.\n\nIn ordinary conversation, \"everything\" usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter. When there is no expressed limitation, \"everything\" may refer to the universe, the world.\n\nThe \"Universe\" is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term \"universe\" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the \"cosmos\", the \"world\" or \"Nature\". According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the multiverse. In the bubble universe theory, there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different physical constants. In the many-worlds hypothesis, new universes are spawned with every quantum measurement. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if they exist, they would still be part of everything.\n\nEspecially in a metaphysical context, \"World\" may refer to everything that constitutes reality and the Universe: see World (philosophy). However, world may \"only\" refer to \"Earth\" envisioned from an anthropocentric or human worldview, as a place by human beings.\n\nIn theoretical physics, a \"theory of everything\" (TOE) is a hypothetical theory that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of Ijon Tichy—a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem's science fiction stories of 1960s—was known to work on the \"General Theory of Everything\". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of quantum physics to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions of nature.\n\nThere have been many theories of everything proposed by theoretical physicists over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity are hard to combine. Whereas theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine. \n\nBased on theoretical holographic principle arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional M-theory, which is described in many sectors by matrix string theory, and in many other sectors by perturbative string theory, is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.\n\nIn philosophy, a \"theory of everything\" or \"TOE\" is an ultimate, all-encompassing explanation of nature or reality. Adopting the term from physics, where the search for a theory of everything is ongoing, philosophers have discussed the viability of the concept and analyzed its properties and implications. Among the questions to be addressed by a philosophical theory of everything are: \"Why is reality understandable?\" \"Why are the laws of nature as they are?\" \"Why is there anything at all?\"\n\n"}
{"id": "12780889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12780889", "title": "Fabel", "text": "Fabel\n\nFabel is a critical term and a dramaturgical technique pioneered by the twentieth-century German theatre practitioner Bertolt Brecht.\n\n\"Fabel\" should not be confused with 'fable', which is a form of short narrative (hence the retention of the original German spelling in its adoption into English usage). Elizabeth Wright argues that it is \"a term of art which cannot be adequately translated\".\n\nAs a critical term, \"fabel\" refers to an analysis of the plot of a play. This includes three interrelated but distinct aspects: firstly, an analysis of the events portrayed in the story. In an epic production, this analysis would focus on the social interactions between the characters and the causality of their behaviour from a historical materialist perspective; the \"fabel\" summarizes \"the moral of the story not in a merely ethical sense, but also in a socio-political one\". For example, in relation to Brecht's play \"Man Equals Man\" (1926), Wright argues that \"[t]he \"fabel\" of this play centres on the transformation of an individual through his insertion into a collective.\"\n\nSecondly, a \"fabel\" analyzes the plot from a formal and semiotic perspective. This includes the play's dramatic structure and its formal shaping of the events portrayed. It also includes an analysis of the semiotic fabric of the play, recognizing that it \"does not simply correspond to actual events in the collective life of human beings, but consists of invented happenings [and that t]he stage figures are not simple representations of living persons, but invented and shaped in response to ideas.\"\n\nThirdly, a \"fabel\" analyzes the attitudes that the play appears to embody and articulate (in the sense of the author's, the characters' and, eventually, the company's). Brecht refers to this aspect of a play as its \"Gestus\". Analyzing a play in this way presupposes Brecht's recognition that \"every\" play encodes such attitudes; \"for art to be 'unpolitical'\", he argued in his \"Short Organum for the Theatre\" (1949), \"means only to ally itself with the 'ruling' group\".\n\nAs a practical tool, \"fabels\" form part of the process of engaging with a play-text undertaken by a company when mounting a production of a play. A \"fabel\" is a piece of creative writing, usually made by a dramaturg or the director, that summarizes the plot of a play in such a way as to emphasize the production’s interpretation of that play-text. It is produced in order to make clear the company's \"particular way\" of understanding and rendering the story. In this respect, it is related to the concept of Gestus (insofar as this renders an action and an attitude towards that action simultaneously); a \"fabel\" indicates the sequence of gestic episodes that constitute the dramatic or theatrical narrative.\n\nCarl Weber, who worked as a director with Brecht at his Berliner Ensemble, explains that:\n\"[w]hat he [Brecht] called \"fabel\" was the plot of the play told as a sequence of interactions, describing each event in the dialectic fashion developed by Hegel, Marx and, in Brecht’s last years, also by Mao. This may sound quite theoretical, but in Brecht’s practice the \"fabel\" was something utterly concrete and practical. Acting, music, the visual elements of the staging, in short, everything an audience perceived, had to contribute to the storytelling and make it lucid, convincing, entertaining and ‘elegant’--as Brecht liked to put it. One result was that the Ensemble’s productions were quite well understood by international audiences who could not follow the German text. Brecht insisted that the configuration and movement of actors and objects on stage should clearly ‘tell the \"fabel\"’. If they were to watch a play through a glass wall blocking all sound, the audience should still be able to follow the essential story. He also insisted that each of the performance elements: acting, design, music and so forth, should remain a recognisable separate entity while it contributed to the \"fabel\"’s presentation. Brecht liked to speak of a 'storytelling arrangement', which meant the specific blocking of actors and all props employed in a scene. He regarded this arrangement as the most important means to achieve a clear presentation of the \"fabel\", and the term 'scenic writing' may best convey what he was aiming for. [. . .] The thorough and extremely detailed preparation included countless discussions in which a text was dissected to determine which \"fabel\" it might yield.\"\n\nAs Weber's reference here to 'scenic writing' suggests, a director or other company member may produce multiple \"fabels\" during the course of a production, each detailing and clarifying a different aspect of the process: a dramatic analysis; an interpretive proposal; an initial springboard position from which to initiate a process of exploration and experiment in rehearsals; a description of individual production aspects (the lighting \"fabel\", the sound \"Fabel\", the visual or scenic design \"fabel\", etc.); an account of progress made at different stages of the rehearsal process; individual actor performance and character behaviour \"fabels\". Virtually any aspect of the theatrical process of production may be explored through the use of a specific \"fabel\".\n\nJohn Willett, Brecht's English translator, suggests that:\n\"[t]he primary principle which [Brecht] taught his collaborators was that of the \"fabel\" or story. The chain of events must be clearly and strongly established not just in the production, but beforehand in the actual play. Where it was not clear it was up to the ‘Dramaturg’ to alter the text, in order to cut unnecessary entanglements and come to the point. The play itself might be by Farquhar or Gerhart Hauptmann, Lenz or Molière, but ‘the writer’s words are only sacred insofar as they are true’. This went for Brecht’s own words as well, and his plays were subject to continual small changes even in the course of a single run. Atmosphere and ‘psychology’ did not matter as such; everything would emerge given a clear and credible sequence of concrete events. ‘Each scene,’ says a writer in \"Theaterarbeit\",\nThe chain of events had become his substitute for the tidy, comprehensive ‘plot’. Thus the \"Short Organum\":\n‘Playing according to the sense’, the Ensemble calls it; and the sense is what Brecht tried to get clear in any play, first for himself and his collaborators, then for the audience too.Hence, for example, his emphasis on that side of Shakespeare’s work which is so often neglected: the actual story. ‘It is a long time,’ he found, ‘since our theatre played these scenes for the events contained in them; they are played only for the outbursts of temperament which the events allow.’ [. . . ]\nIn such conferences Brecht would get his colleagues to make a written or verbal précis of the play, and later they would have to write descriptions of an actual performance. Both were practice in distilling the incidents that count.\n\nA \"fabel\" specifies, narrativizes, and objectifies the attitudes and activities involved in the process of producing a play. In doing so, it enables company members to dialecticize that process—in the sense that a particular \"fabel\" provides a fixed 'snapshot' of a transitory and constantly developing process in a form that enables comparisons to be made. These comparisons may be between the description in the \"Fabel\" and the reality of the production as it stands or between different \"fabels\" (which have been generated by the production either at different stages of the process or in relation to different aspects—lighting, sound, blocking, etc.---of it); for example, having produced a \"Fabel\" at the beginning of the rehearsal process, the director may return to it near the end of rehearsals to check that the production is 'telling the story' intended (or, alternatively, to clarify the ways in which that story has changed as a result of rehearsal exploration and development).\n\nThe use of \"fabels\" does not predetermine the style of production nor does it necessarily require an epic dramaturgy or aesthetic (the elimination of suspense and mystery, defamiliarization effects, etc.), despite having originated in Brechtian practice. The creation of \"Fabels\" is an attempt to achieve clarity for the \"producers\" (actors, director, designers) rather than the \"audience\" (which would characterize an epic production). One may create psychological (in a Stanislavskian approach) or metaphysical (in an Artaudian approach) \"fabels\" as well as the social ones that Brecht explored.\n\n"}

{"id": "14703837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14703837", "title": "Great White Brotherhood", "text": "Great White Brotherhood\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and New Age, are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (Theosophy), after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included Helena Roerich, Aleister Crowley, Alice A. Bailey, Guy Ballard, Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), Elizabeth Clare Prophet and Benjamin Creme.\n\nThe idea of a secret organization of enlightened mystics, guiding the spiritual development of the human race, was pioneered in the late eighteenth century by Karl von Eckartshausen (1752-1803) in his book \"The Cloud upon the Sanctuary\"; Eckartshausen called this body of mystics, who remained active after their physical deaths on earth, the \"Council of Light\". Eckartshausen's proposed communion of living and dead mystics, in turn, drew partially on Christian ideas such as the Communion of the Saints, and partially on previously circulating European ideas about secret societies of enlightened, mystical, or magic adepts typified by the Rosicrucians and the Illuminati.\n\nThe \"Mahatma Letters\" began publication in 1881 with information purportedly revealed by \"Koot Hoomi\" to Alfred Percy Sinnett, and were also influential on the early development of the tradition. Koot Hoomi, through Sinnett, revealed that high-ranking members of mystic organizations in India and Tibet were able to maintain regular telepathic contact with one another, and thus were able to communicate to each other, and also to Sinnett, without the need for either written or oral communications, and in a manner similar to the way that spirit mediums claimed to communicate with the spirits of the dead. The letters published by Sinnett, which proposed the controversial doctrine of reincarnation, were said to have been revealed through this means.\n\nEckartshausen's idea was expanded in the teachings of Helena P. Blavatsky as developed by Charles W. Leadbeater, Alice Bailey and Helena Roerich. Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, attributed her teachings to just such a body of adepts; in her 1877 book \"Isis Unveiled\", she called the revealers of her teachings the \"Masters of the Hidden Brotherhood\" or the \"Mahatmas\". Blavatsky claimed that she had made physical contact with these adepts' earthly representatives in Tibet; but also, that she continued to receive teachings from them through psychic channels, through her abilities of spirit mediumship.\n\nIdeas about this secret council of sages, under several names, were a widely shared feature of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century esotericism. Arthur Edward Waite, in his 1898 \"Book of Black Magic and of Pacts\", hinted at the existence of a secret group of initiates who dispense truth and wisdom to the worthy. A young Aleister Crowley, reading this, wrote Waite and was directed to read von Eckartshausen's book. Crowley's search for this secret wisdom eventually led him to become a neophyte in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which represented itself to be the visible and earthly outer order of the Great White Brotherhood. Within the Golden Dawn itself, its teachings claimed to be derived from a similar body of initiates which in that tradition were called the Secret Chiefs.\n\nThe actual phrase \"Great White Brotherhood\" was used extensively in Leadbeater's 1925 book \"The Masters and the Path\". Alice A. Bailey also claimed to have received numerous revelations from the Great White Brotherhood between 1920 and 1949, which are compiled in her books known collectively by her followers as the \"Alice A. Bailey Material.\" Since the introduction of the phrase, the term \"Great White Brotherhood\" is in some circles used generically to refer to any concept of an enlightened community of adepts, on earth or in the hereafter, with benevolent aims toward the spiritual development of the human race, and without strict regard to the names used within the tradition. Dion Fortune adopts the name to refer to the community of living and dead adepts.\n\nThe ritual magicians of the Western mystery tradition sometimes refer to the Great White Brotherhood as the \"Great White Lodge\", a name that appears to indicate that they imagine it constitutes an initiatory hierarchy similar to Freemasonry. Gareth Knight describes its members as the \"Masters\" or \"Inner Plane Adepti\", who have \"gained all the experience, and all the wisdom resulting from experience, necessary for their spiritual evolution in the worlds of form.\" While some go on to \"higher evolution in other spheres\", others become teaching Masters who stay behind to help younger initiates in their \"cyclic evolution on this planet\". Only a few of this community are known to the human race; these initiates are the \"teaching Masters.\" The AMORC Rosicrucian order maintains a difference between the \"Great White Brotherhood\" and the \"Great White Lodge\", saying that the Great White Brotherhood is the \"school or fraternity\" of the Great White Lodge, and that \"every true student on the Path\" aspires to membership in this Brotherhood. Some of Aleister Crowley's remarks appear to indicate that Crowley identified the Great White Brotherhood with the A∴A∴, his magical secret society.\n\nBulgarian Gnostic master Peter Deunov referred to his organization of followers as the Universal White Brotherhood, and it is clear that he too was referring to the Western esoteric community-at-large. When ex-communicated as a heretic on 7 July 1922, he defended the Brotherhood as follows:\nSimilarly, Bulgarian teacher Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov (Deunov's principal disciple) formally established Fraternité Blanche Universelle as an \"exoteric\" esoteric organization still operating today in Switzerland, Canada, the USA, the UK and parts of Scandinavia.\n\nThe term \"Great White Brotherhood\" was further developed and popularized in 1934 with the publication of \"Unveiled Mysteries\" by Guy Ballard's \"I AM\" Activity. This Brotherhood of \"Immortal Saints and Sages\" who have gone through the Initiations of the Transfiguration, Resurrection, and the Ascension was further popularized by Ascended Master Teachings developed by The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse and the Church Universal and Triumphant, and The Temple of The Presence.\n\nBenjamin Creme has published books—he claims the information within them has been telepathically transmitted to him from the Great White Brotherhood.\n\nIn 1952, Geraldine Innocente, messenger for \"The Bridge to Freedom\", delivered this address purported to be from Sanat Kumara describing the founding of the \"Great White Brotherhood\":\n\nMembers of The Bridge to Freedom believe that on July 4, 1954 Sanat Kumara stated through Geraldine Innocente:\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood, also known as Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, is perceived as a spiritual organization composed of those Ascended Masters who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but still maintain an active watch over the world. C.W. Leadbeater said \"The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the Spiritual Hierarchy directly concerned with the evolution of our world), Beneficent Members from other planets that are interested in our welfare, as well as certain unascended chelas\".\n\nThe Masters of the Ancient Wisdom are believed by Theosophists to be joined together in service to the Earth under the name of the Great White Brotherhood. The use of the term \"white\" refers to their use of white magic, as opposed to black, and is unrelated to race. The later versions of Blavatsky described the masters as ethnically Tibetan or Indian (Hindu), not European. Recent skeptical research indicates, however, that this description was used by Blavatsky to hide the real identity of her teachers, some of whom are said to have really been well known Indian rulers or personalities of her time.\n\nMost occult groups assign a high level of importance to the Great White Brotherhood, but some make interaction with the Ascended Masters of the Brotherhood a major focus of their existence. Of these several, the most prominent are the \"I Am\" Activity, founded in the 1930s, The Bridge to Freedom, the Church Universal and Triumphant, and The Temple of The Presence. Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the syncretistic teachings of various organizations that have continued and expanded the Theosophical philosophical concepts. Information given by the Summit Lighthouse and the I AM movement is suspect, since none of the writers of these groups are Masters of any Brotherhood. Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters would be, according to different unconfirmed sources are the Master Jesus, Confucius, Gautama Buddha, Mary the Mother of Jesus, Hilarion, Enoch, Paul the Venetian, Kwan Yin, Saint Germain, and Kuthumi. These sources say that all these peoples put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.\n\nThe Great White Brotherhood is the name given in some metaphysical/occult circles to adepts of wisdom in or out of earthly incarnation who have assumed responsibility for the cosmic destiny of the human race, both individually and collectively. Nicholas Roerich and his wife, Helena Roerich, inspired by the Theosophical writings of H.P. Blavatsky, published the \"Agni Yoga\" series of books. Their contents, claimed to be inspired by the Master Morya, described the work of the White Brotherhood and the Spiritual Hierarchy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26651584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26651584", "title": "History of ideas", "text": "History of ideas\n\nThe history of ideas is a field of research in history that deals with the expression, preservation, and change of human ideas over time. The history of ideas is a sister-discipline to, or a particular approach within, intellectual history. Work in the history of ideas may involve interdisciplinary research in the history of philosophy, the history of science, or the history of literature. In Sweden, the history of ideas and science or \"Idé- och lärdomshistoria\" has been a distinct university subject since 6 November 1932, when Johan Nordström, a scholar of literature, was appointed professor of the new discipline in a ceremony at Uppsala University (coinciding with that commemorating the 300-year anniversary of the Battle of Lützen). Today, several universities across the world provide courses in this field, usually as part of a graduate programme.\n\nThe historian Arthur O. Lovejoy (1873–1962) coined the phrase \"history of ideas\" and initiated its systematic study in the early decades of the 20th century. Johns Hopkins University was a \"fertile cradle\" to Lovejoy's history of ideas; he worked there as a professor of history, from 1910 to 1939, and for decades he presided over the regular meetings of the \"History of Ideas Club\". Another outgrowth of his work is the \"Journal of the History of Ideas\".\n\nAside from his students and colleagues engaged in related projects (such as René Wellek and Leo Spitzer, with whom Lovejoy engaged in extended debates), scholars such as Isaiah Berlin, Michel Foucault, Christopher Hill, J. G. A. Pocock, and others have continued to work in a spirit close to that with which Lovejoy pursued the history of ideas. The first chapter of Lovejoy's book \"The Great Chain of Being\" (1936) lays out a general overview of what he intended to be the programme and scope of the study of the history of ideas.\n\nLovejoy's history of ideas takes as its basic unit of analysis the unit-idea, or the individual concept. These unit-ideas work as the building-blocks of the history of ideas: though they are relatively unchanged in themselves over the course of time, unit-ideas recombine in new patterns and gain expression in new forms in different historical eras. As Lovejoy saw it, the historian of ideas had the task of identifying such unit-ideas and of describing their historical emergence and recession in new forms and combinations.\n\nThe unit-idea methodology, intended to extract the basic idea within any philosophical work and movement, also has certain defining principles: 1) assumptions, 2) dialectical motives, 3) metaphysical pathos, and 4) philosophical semantics. These different principles define the overarching philosophical movement within which, Lovejoy argues, one can find the unit-idea, which can then be studied throughout the history of that idea.\n\nQuentin Skinner criticizes Lovejoy's \"unit-idea\" methodology, and he argues that such a \"reification of doctrines\" has negative consequences. He emphasizes sensitivity to the cultural context of the texts and ideas being analysed. Skinner's own historical methodology is based on J.L. Austin's theory of speech acts. Andreas Dorschel criticizes Skinner's restrictive approach to ideas through verbal language, and points out how ideas can materialize in non-linguistic media or genres such as music and architecture.\n\nAnother important development within the study of ideas has been within the academic discipline of Intellectual History. The Harvard historian Peter Gordon explains that intellectual history, as opposed to the history of ideas practiced by Lovejoy, studies and deals with ideas within a broader context. Gordon further emphasises that intellectual historians, as opposed to historians of ideas and philosophers (History of Philosophy), \"tend to be more relaxed about crossing the boundary between philosophical texts and non-philosophical contexts...[they regard] the distinction between \"philosophy\" and \"non-philosophy\" as something that is itself historically conditioned rather than eternally fixed.\" Therefore, intellectual history, as a means of reproducing a historically valid interpretation of a philosophical argument, tends to implement a contextualist approach when studying ideas and broader philosophical movements.\n\nMichel Foucault rejects the idea of the traditional way historians go about writing, which is a narrative. He believed that most historians preferred to write about long periods of time instead of digging deeper into a more specific history. Foucault argues that historians should reveal historical descriptions through different perspectives. This is where he comes up with the term “archaeology” for his method of historical writing. His historical method differs from the traditional sense of historical writing and is divided up into four different ideas.\n\nThe first is that \"archaeology\" seeks to define the history through philosophical means, which is to say the discourse between thought, representation, and themes. The second is that, in \"archaeology,\" the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines. The third idea is that \"archaeology\" does not seek to grasp the moment in history at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another. And finally the fourth point is that \"archaeology\" does not seek the truth of history, rather it seeks the discourse in it.\n\n\n"}

He also taught at U.S. universities (1963–67), before becoming Chairman of the Experimental Geology Department at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zürich), in 1967, where he was Emeritus Professor of Geology until 1994. Hsu started his business career after his retirement from teaching.\n\nProfessorships & lectureships\n\nHsu was a lecturer, guest or honorary professor in geology, climatology or oceanography at numerous renowned universities of the world, including Beijing, California (San Diego), Cambridge, Columbia, Florence, Harvard, London, Milan, M.I.T., Moscow, Nanjing, Naples, Ohio, Oxford, Paris, Princeton, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Washington, Woods Hole, Yale etc.\n\nAfter retirement in 1994, he was Guest Professor at the National Taiwan University (1994–95), Guest Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Senior Fellow at the Berlin Institute of Advanced Studies (1995-56), Keck Professor at Colorado School of Mines, University Professor at Nanjing University, and University Professor at Beijing University of Geosciences.\n\nScientific work\n\nHsu served in numerous scientific organizations:\n\n\nEditorships\n\nHsu was Editor and or Associate Editor of numerous journals including:\n\n\nInstitutional work\n\nHsu was elected a Member of the U. S. National Academy of Science in 1986. He later became a Foreign Associate. He was also an Associate of the Third-World Academy of Sciences, a Member of Academia Sinica (1988), the Mediterranean Academy of Sciences and several other academies of science. He was a founder of the European Geophysical Society and a founder of the science of paleooceanography. He convened the First International Conference of Paleoceanography and founded the journal Paleoceanography. Hsu also assisted in the founding of the Asian Association of Marine Geology. He also served for 11 years as President of the International Association of Sedimentologists. Hsu was the convener of the Third Workshop on Marine Geology of IUGS; the First Earth Science Colloquium of the European Science Foundation; several Dahlem Conferences of the Dahlem Foundation; and numerous symposia and workshops for IGP, ILP, IGCP, SCOR and JOIDE.\n\nAdvisory work\n\nHsu was a convener of numerous scientific conferences, founder of several scientific societies, and advisor to the governments of developing countries:\n\n\nScientific exploration\n\nHsu participated and led 5 deep-sea drilling cruises to the South Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Black Sea. He also led several international expeditions to Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, South China, California Coast Ranges and the Swiss Alps, travelling to 80 countries for Earth Science.\n\nAcademic work\n\nHsu joined ETH Zürich in 1967 as an associate professor and built up 5 leading international laboratories in the fields of rock mechanics (geophysics), mass-spectrometry (isotope geochemistry), Quaternary research (paleoclimatology), sedimentology and tectonics. During Hsu's 28-year tenure, 4 of the Geological Institute's staff received the Wollaston Medal.\n\nPolitical work\n\nHis co-organized a consortium of 15 European member states to join the International Ocean Drilling Program.\n\nChina work\n\nHsu successfully lobbied for the admission of the Chinese Geological Union to replace the Chinese Geological Society in Tapieh as a member of the International Union of Geological Sciences and was a member of the first IUGS delegation to China. He served the Chinese Ministry of Geology and Mining in giving training programs for Sedimentology (1979), Field Geology of Tibet (1980) and Plate Tectonics (1992). From 1983-1995, he assisted the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the completion of a project on plate tectonics and to publish a new Geological Atlas of China.\n\nAppreciation\n\nTwo Festschrift symposia books, \"Controversies in Geology\", and \"Paradoxes in Geology\", were published by Hsu's colleagues on his 60th and 70th birthdays. In September 2009, his contributions to China and to science were acknowledged at a conference in Beijing, attended by dignitaries from government, industry and academia. He participated in the Earth Science Revolution of the 1960s, and is active in the field of evolutionary biology (symbiogenesis) with Lynn Margulis, and in the reform of geological education and physics.\n\nAffiliations\n\n\nAwards\n\nFor his contributions to geology, Hsu received several medals and awards.\n\n\nIn geology, his work included sedimentation in isostatically driven tectonic basins, the active margins of continental plates, physical chemistry of evaporite and pelagic diagenesis, documentation of granulite formation, catastrophic consequences of meteorite impacts, extinction of life forms and the limnology of Lake Zurich.\n\nEnterprise\n\nAfter his retirement, Hsu made several inventions in mining, oil, water and energy technology, and founded various companies including Tarim Resource Recycling Limited (UK, 2003); Kenneth Hsu IHC Technology & Development Limited (China, 2005) and Lazarus Energy International Limited (UK, 2007).\n\nInventions\n\nHsu was awarded 16 patents in mining, petroleum, water, carbon, energy and environment management, including the Hydro-Transistor and Integrated Hydrologic Circuit (IHC).\n\nHsu's technologies applied in China included:\n\nEndorsements\n\nAfter extensive research and development, Hsu's water technologies were unanamiously endorsed by an expert panel called by the Chinese State Counsellors' Office (Civilian Chief of Staff) of the Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao; and by Nobel Laureate Samuel Ting, and University of California Chancellor, Henry Yang, who both served on the Chinese Premiere's KHC Advisory Board.\n\nIn 2000, Hsu combined the newly developed enhanced oil recovery techniques of hydro-fracturing and horizontal drilling, with water flooding, to invent a totally new process of residual oil recovery (ROR), called 3-dimensional fluid injection, to exploit residual oil. The method utilized water rather than carbon dioxide, although carbon dioxide can also be used in the process. Hsu suggested the technique could increase the recoverable petroleum reserve of the world by a factor of 50% or more. \n\nWith the full support of the Chinese Prime Minister, Wen Jiabao, in February 2006, an Expert Panel called by former Petroleum Minister Dr Wang Tao, unanimously agreed Hsu's ROR invention was innovative, and should be tested and applied in China. In April 2006, PetroChina reported a successful test at the Changqing Oil Field (Northwest China), first discovered in 1907. Prior to the test, its annual production was about 10,000 tons. In 2006, this rose to 10 million tons, and in 2007, to 20 million tons.\n\nVentures\n\nHsu is active with institutions, organizations and corporations to apply the new technologies in China and internationally.\n\nConsultancy\n\nHsu is President of the IHC Technology & Development Corporation (China), Senior Advisor and Chief Engineer to the Kenneth Hsu Institute for IHC Development (National Institute Of Earth Sciences, Beijing) and Director of the Center for Environmental & Health Engineering (Henan University, Kaifeng). His work on the link between nitrite in drinking water and cancer was documented in The Ecologist journal.\n\n\nHsu authored or edited over 20 books, many in multiple languages, and was elected an International Writer of the Year by the International Book Club (Cambridge, UK) in 2003.\n\nThe Mediterranean Was A Desert, 1982\n\nThe book concerned Hsu's work deciphering the Messinian Salinity Crisis and provided a first-hand account of one of the most significant deep-sea drilling cruises ever launched. The voyage, Leg 13 of the D/V Glomar Challenger, was undertaken in 1970 and led to the hypothesis that 5.5 million years ago, the Mediterranean was a desert. It documented the adventures of the oceanographic expedition and offered portraits of 'big' science and 'big' scientists at work, with human touches, as a memoir for historians of science. The book was selected by Philip Morrison of Scientific American as one of the 100 most significant and influential books of science in the 20th century. A film was also made by PBS, based on the book.\n\nChallenger At Sea, 1983\n\nThe book was an overview of the then current state of marine geology and a source book for the history of that science, and was used as a geology textbook for non-majors.\n\nThe Great Dying, 1986\n\nThe book described the circumstances leading to the discovery that the dinosaur extinction was triggered by a cometary impact. An inquiry into the nature of survival and extinction, it was published in 6 languages, selling over 170,000 copies worldwide, selling 28,000 copies in the United States between 1986 and 1988; 100,000 copies in Mainland China in 1989 and 40,000 copies in Taiwan. A popular newspaper in Taipei \"United Post\" featured \"The Great Dying\" in its weekly list of best-selling books list for more than a year, and it was chosen as a top non-fiction book of the year in August 1992. Originally intended to teach the public, the book was used as a textbook in the United States for its scientific method. A film was also made based on the book by ZDF.\n\nIn the book, Hsu marshalled \"some of the most gripping and controversial geological discoveries of our time to blast Darwin’s claim and to shake the foundations of his evolutionary theory,\" showing evidence indicating a meteor collided with the Earth, 66 million years ago, leaving much of it uninhabitable, and warning that a similar event may threaten humanity in the future.\n\nHsu criticized Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. According to Hsu \"If most extinctions are caused by catastrophes... then chance, not superiority, presides over who shall live and who shall die. Indeed, the whole course of evolution may be governed by chance, and not reflect at all the slow march from inferior to superior forms so beloved by Victorians, and so deeply embedded in Western thought.\" The book endorses catastrophism and non-Darwinian evolution.\n\nKlima Macht Geschichte, 2000\n\n\"\" presented a theory of climate and history, looking at future climate changes based on historical, archaeological and helio-biological evidence. It made the prediction of global cooling of the planet in the last decades of the 21st century, and the coming of a little ice age before 2500. The claim forecast was corroborated by scientists Khabibullo Abdusamatov, Yuk Yung, John Cassey, Nigel Calder, Henrik Svensmark, Alexander Chizhevsky and John D. Hamaker . Orell Fussli Verlag published the book after an article about Hsu appeared in Bilanz Magazine in 1998. Earlier, in 1992, Hsu wrote in \"Geographical Magazine\", \"Perhaps our species was created by Gaia to prevent a catastrophic chill\" in reference to his published paper \"'Is Gaia Endothermic?\", on which the book is also based.\n\nAmadeus & Magdalena, 2002\n\nPublished in Chinese, English and German, with a Chinese translation titled \"莫扎特的愛與死\"., the book presented Hsu's musicological theory about the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nA complete list of books by Kenneth Hsu is available at the Kenneth J. Hsu Official Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHsu is the author or co-author of more than 400 scientific articles on Archaeology, Cancer, Chronon Physics, Climatology, Cosmology, Cytology, Epistemology, Evolution, Fractal Geometry, Gaia, Geology, Heliobiology, History, Hydro-Physics, Languages, Marine Biology, Mathematics, Marine Biology, Music, Oceanography, Palaeontology, Paleoclimatology, Philosophy, Politics, Religion and Symbiogenesis.

Individuals using a computer with appropriate software can represent concepts and the relationships between concepts in a node-relationship-node formalism. The process of thinking about the concepts and making associations between them has been called \"off-loading\" by McAleese.\n\nThe concept map is a form of a semantic network or semantic graph. It is formally based on graph theory. In the concept map, concepts are represented by nodes. The relationship between nodes are represented by \"typed links\" or \"edges\". (See Graph theory.) In creating a map or graphic representation of what is known an individual intentionally interacts with the graphical interface or map and through a reflective process adds nodes (concepts) and /or adds relationships (edges or typed links) or modifies existing node-relationship-node instances. It is likely that the process of engaging with concepts and relationships between concepts brings about the creation of understandings as well as making the understandings explicit.\n\nMany different claims have been made for the utility of the concept map. The interactive and reflective nature of map creation is highlighted by the use of the description Knowledge Arena. Although maps may represent what an individual knows at a point in time; it is likely that by interacting with the concepts and relationships in the knowledge arena individual continues to create and modify what that individual \"knows\".\n\nSee also \n"}

{"id": "14893056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14893056", "title": "Los Horcones", "text": "Los Horcones\n\nLos Horcones is an intentional community located about 40 miles from Hermosillo, Mexico. It has described itself \"as the only true \"Walden Two\" community in existence\". The members of Los Horcones use techniques based on behavioral science to shape their own and each other's behaviors. They use those behavior-shaping techniques in politically coordinated ways and they do so in order to \"continuously improve\" themselves and their culture. They are striving to build a culture \"based on cooperation, sharing, non-violence, equality and ecological sustainability\".\n\n\"Experimentalism\" and \"continuous improvement\" are two of the most important doctrines of a Walden Two community. Burrhus Frederic Skinner, author of the novel \"Walden Two\", expressed this in the following way. He wrote:\n\nThe members of Los Horcones refer to their community as a cultural laboratory and they regard themselves as cultural engineers. They will readily adopt new cultural behaviors when experimental evidence indicates that doing so will improve their lives. As a result of their cultural engineering efforts, they are unlikely to suffer from cultural lag.\n\nLos Horcones is listed in the \"Communities Directory\" of the Fellowship for Intentional Community.\n\nLos Horcones can also be regarded as an \"experimental community\". When the members of Los Horcones encounter problems they design and conduct experiments to test possible solutions to their problems. Depending on the result of an experiment, they may collectively resolve to make an experimental behavior into a community-approved component of their behavioral culture. In this way, the Los Horconans try to exercise control over the evolution of their culture.\n\nDespite being sometimes referred to as an \"utopian vision\", a Walden Two community does not claim to be perfect. An experimental community attempts to thrive on its problems because its problems are seen as opportunities for experimentation. According to its proponents, an experimental community can be thought of as a \"eutopia\" (a good place) in which there is always room for experimentation and improvement.\n\n\"The Behavior of Organisms\", B. F. Skinner's first book, was published in 1938. The research strategy that Dr. Skinner presented in that book was widely adopted and grew into a school of psychology named the experimental analysis of behavior. That school is today known as Behavior Analysis.\n\nAs Behavior Analysis grew larger, a growing number of scholars began to believe that Behavior Analysis had outgrown its place in Psychology and that it was time to establish a separate discipline. Makram Khalil Samaan gave expression to this belief in 1973 when he wrote, \"It is time now for the scientific analysis of behavior to call for its own scientific discipline. It is contradictory to its function, objective, methods and content to stay within the realm of psychology.\" Mr. Samaan suggested that the scientific analysis of behavior become a separate scientific discipline named \"behaviorology\".\n\nIn 1974 the Los Horconans began using the term \"behaviorology\" to refer to \"the natural science of behavior\". Their summary of behaviorology reads as follows: \"Behaviorology encompasses basic research, applied research and philosophy. Basic research includes (a) descriptive analysis of behavior (behaviography), (b) experimental analysis of behavior (experimental behaviorology), and (c) a theoretical or conceptual analysis of behavior (theoretical behaviorology). Applied research refers to behavior-analytic applications of the experimental analysis of behavior to the prevention and solution of social problems. As such, it includes (a) applied research in the form of experimental analysis oriented towards finding solutions to social problems and (b) behavioral technology, in the form of behavior-analytic procedures alone. The philosophy of behaviorology is that of behaviorism, which includes both, philosophical (or metatheoretical) assumptions and the philosophical implications of data obtained by the experimental analysis of behavior and its applications.\"\n\nThe International Behaviorology Association (TIBA) was founded in 1987. TIBA's purpose statement reads, in part, \"TIBA is a professional organization dedicated to representing and developing the philosophical, analytical, experimental, and technological components of the discipline of behaviorology, the comprehensive natural science of the functional relations of behavior including determinants from the environment, both socio-cultural and non-cultural, as well as determinants from the biological history of the species\".\n\nIn August 1988 three Los Horconans attended the first TIBA convention, which was held at Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York.\nThe second TIBA convention was held at Los Horcones in January 1990. To accommodate that convention, the Los Horconans built a convention hall and several residential buildings.\n\nTIBA subsequently changed its name and is today known as the International Society for Behaviorology (ISB). The ISB describes itself as \"an organization of behavioral materialists who hold that: (a) evolution from nonhuman to human behavior is a continuous physical, biological, and behaviorological process; (b) contingencies evoke, shape, and maintain behavior and its processes with no implied or inferred agency playing a causal role\". The ISB's twenty-first annual convention was held in Newport Beach, California. That convention opened on March 18, 2009 and closed 2 days later on March 20, after a \"Memorial Dinner\" that celebrated the birth of B. F. Skinner on March 20, 1904.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, Los Horcones is a corporation. The corporation's full name is Comunidad de los Horcones. It was organized in 1973 and it operates under the laws of the State of Sonora, one of the thirty-one states that together make up the United Mexican States. Los Horcones is a particular type of corporation: it is a producer cooperative.\n\nThe corporation owns a parcel of land that contains approximately 260 acres (105 hectares). That parcel is approximately 1,312 feet (400 meters) above sea level. The members of Los Horcones live in buildings which are located on that parcel. Most of those buildings are grouped together on the southern half of the parcel (see aerial photograph). The parcel is bounded on its northern border by Mexican Federal Highway 16 (Carretera Federal 16). The drive from Hermosillo, capital of the State of Sonora, takes about 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215250", "title": "MacGyver (1985 TV series)", "text": "MacGyver (1985 TV series)\n\nMacGyver is an American action-adventure television series created by Lee David Zlotoff and starring Richard Dean Anderson as the title character. Henry Winkler and John Rich were the executive producers. The show ran for seven seasons on ABC in the United States and various other networks abroad from 1985 to 1992. The series was filmed in Los Angeles during seasons one, two, and seven, and in Vancouver during seasons three through six. The show's final episode aired on April 25, 1992 on ABC (the network aired a previously unseen episode for the first time on May 21, 1992, but it was originally intended to air before the series finale).\n\nThe series was a moderate ratings success and gained a loyal following. It was popular in the United States and around the world. Two television movies, \"MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis\" and \"MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday\", aired on ABC in 1994. A spin-off series, \"Young MacGyver,\" was planned in 2003, but only the pilot was made. Merchandise for \"MacGyver\" includes games, toys, print media and an original audio series.\n\nA reboot series of the same name premiered on September 23, 2016 on CBS, which today owns the rights to the series through its acquisition of the original Paramount Television.\n\nThe show follows secret agent Angus MacGyver, played by Richard Dean Anderson, who works as a troubleshooter for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles and as an agent for a fictional United States government agency, the \"Department of External Services\" (DXS). Educated as a scientist in Physics at Western Tech (\"Hell Week\"), MacGyver served in the U.S. Army Special Forces as a Bomb Team Technician/EOD during the Vietnam War (\"Countdown\"). Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the physical sciences, he solves complex problems by making things out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife, duct tape, and occasionally matches. He favors non-violent resolutions and prefers not to handle a gun due to a gun death of one of his friends in his teenage years.\n\nHis main asset is his practical application of scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problemsoften in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices in a matter of minuteswere a major attraction of the show, which was praised for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering, and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged, in real life one would have to be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix up poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.\n\nThe show often dealt with social issues, though more so in seasons 4–7 than 1–3, which were mostly about MacGyver's adventures working for the United States government and later for the Phoenix Foundation.\n\n\nWhile creating the series \"MacGyver\", John Rich was working on the sitcom \"Mr. Sunshine\" for ABC, which was short-lived and cancelled quickly. Henry Winkler had just finished off his eleven-year run on \"Happy Days\" and was looking for another project. Lee David Zlotoff was working as a producer for \"Remington Steele\", which was airing on NBC. The three got together to form the basis for \"MacGyver\" and sold the idea to Paramount, and ABC became interested in the series.\n\nThe series was filmed in Southern California for its first two seasons and again in its final season. From seasons 3-6, it was filmed in various locations around Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. Los Angeles remained as the setting of the show for the entire duration. The move to Vancouver was due to the threat of the series being cancelled due to the high production cost. In seasons 1 and 2, MacGyver was portrayed living in a waterfront apartment in Venice Beach. In season 3, he moved onto a houseboat at an unspecified location, though implied still to be in Los Angeles (the actual shooting took place at Coal Harbour, near downtown Vancouver). Filming returned to Los Angeles for the final season.\n\nWhen the series was in pre-production, Winkler and Rich were looking for a suitable actor for the lead. After Richard Dean Anderson's appearance in the American television series \"The Love Boat\", Winkler got Anderson to audition for the part. According to Rich, every auditioning actor \"hulked\" his way through his audition. When Anderson eventually auditioned for the role, Winkler and Rich felt that he gave the character a human touch which the other actors could not. Both believed that Anderson would become one of the new \"breakout\" stars on American television.\n\nAnderson is known for having done many of the stunts in the series, though in later seasons he reduced his participation because of accumulating injuries. He injured his back and required foot surgery because of accidents working as a stuntman.\n\nSeveral episodes, including the pilot, begin with a cold open, finding MacGyver already on a mission. MacGyver often narrates a story from his childhood relating to his current situation. He resolves this situation quickly, and the main story commences after the opening credits. The credits refer to such an opening sequence as the \"Opening Gambit\"it occurs far more commonly in earlier episodes than in later ones. This segment is often written and directed by a different team than the main story of the episode. After the credits, the main story plays out in standard three-act structure. In many episodes, the opening sequence occurs after the opening credits and often does not involve MacGyver on a mission but rather in a situation used for character development. In the same manner as the \"Opening Gambit\" sequences, these opening segments often do not directly relate to the main story.\n\nAfter a slow start in its first season, \"MacGyver\" became a sleeper hit for ABC in its second season, during which it began a six-year run as the lead-in to ABC's \"Monday Night Football\" (the longest such run in history). During the show's fourth season, Richard Dean Anderson complained that ABC was not marketing the series enough. Saying that the series is \"just another action show\" for ABC, he further stated that ABC didn't give the series enough promotion.\n\n\"MacGyver's\" seventh season was abbreviated. After the twelfth episode of the season aired on December 30, 1991, \"MacGyver\" disappeared from the ABC schedule and did not return until April 25, 1992 by which point the series had been cancelled. The finale aired that night, with a previously unaired episode following on May 21, 1992. When asked why the series was cancelled, Anderson replied: \"The only reason it went off the air was that everybody was ready to move on. I was physically exhausted and had no life.\"\n\nIn 1994, the series was released in over 70 different worldwide markets. Because of popular demand, two TV-movies were created, both released in 1994. The first movie \"MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis\" premiered in the United States in May. The film was shot in England and Greece. The second movie was entitled \"MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday\". Anderson served as executive producer for both films, which were filmed in Europe.\n\nRe-runs of the series still air in North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Ethiopia. Alongside local syndication, reruns aired on the USA Network from 1990 to 1997, on WGN America from 1998 to 2002, on TV Land from January 2003 to 2006, on Spike for a brief time in 2005. It is formerly aired on Cloo (2011–2017) with marathon blocks shown on the weekends and on May 13, 2015, Esquire Network started airing reruns of the series. MeTV Network has acquired some rights to air the series as of December 2, 2015.\n\nParamount Home Entertainment has released all seven seasons of \"MacGyver\" on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. On October 16, 2007, CBS DVD released \"MacGyver: The Complete Series\", a special collectors' edition box set that features all 139 episodes of the series as well as the two TV movies that followed.\n\nOn June 15, 2010, Paramount released the two TV movies on DVD in Region1 in a separate single-disc release entitled \"MacGyver – The TV Movies.\"\n\nOn January 13, 2015, CBS Home Entertainment announced they would release a repackaged version of the complete series set on DVD in Region1, at a lower price, on April 7.\n\nThis series aired weekday afternoons & weeknights on MeTV from 12/19/16-5/26/17.\n\nIn June 2018, CBS announced that the original camera negatives, thought to be lost, had been relocated and a high definition remaster of the series was underway. The June 21 press release confirmed that the first three seasons had been completed, with the remaining four to be remastered before the end of 2018. The press release also included a teaser showcasing the notable improvement in quality.\n\nThe first season was eventually released on October 30, 2018.\n\nThe character's ability to use everyday objects to perform extraordinary feats (sometimes called \"MacGyvering\") has been widely referenced and parodied. There have been a few comedic spin-offs of the show, such as \"Saturday Night Live's\" \"MacGruber,\" which later was made into a full feature film named \"MacGruber\", and a parody of the song \"Hey There Delilah\", which was given the name \"Hey There MacGyver.\"\n\nThe series is referenced in episodes of \"The Simpsons\", primarily detailing the obsession Marge Simpson's sisters (Patty and Selma) have with the show and their crush on the MacGyver character. The sisters' regular viewing of the show is an unalterable element of their daily schedule to the point of death as demonstrated in the episode \"Black Widower\". The episode featured a fictional scene of MacGyver where he downplays his role in saving a village. (\"Don't thank me. Thank the moon's gravitational pull.\") In another episode, \"A Star is Burns\", Homer tricks Jay Sherman into insulting MacGyver in front of Patty and Selma; Sherman ends up being hung from the rain gutter by his underpants, and Bart asks \"You badmouthed MacGyver, didn't you?\" Anderson himself is an avid fan of \"The Simpsons\", and even provided his voice for an episode of the show titled \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\", which first aired April 9, 2006, where Patty and Selma kidnap Richard Dean Anderson after he admits that he never liked doing \"MacGyver\" and only did the show for the money, but eventually gets a thrill out of escaping and annoys them by wanting to do it again and again.\n\nIn the first episode of Anderson's later show, \"Stargate SG-1\", Amanda Tapping mentions that the Air Force had to \"MacGyver\" a Dial Home Device for the Stargate, and a split-second shot following this shows Anderson twitching an eyebrow. (However, this line was removed when this episode was re-released in 2009. ) There is a blooper reel where Tapping's character, who is trapped with Anderson's character on a glacier, begins ranting about how \"we got belt buckles, shoelaces and a piece of gum. Build a nuclear reactor, for cryin' out loud! You used to be MacGyver, MacGadget, MacGimmick... now you're Mr. MacUseless... Dear God, I'm stuck on a glacier with MacGyver!\" Later, various episodes establish that Jack O'Neill (Anderson's character) has an immense love of the cartoon series \"The Simpsons\".\n\nIn 2001, the band They Might Be Giants released a song titled \"All MacGyver on It\" on the Japanese version of their album \"Mink Car\".\n\nIn 2006, Anderson appeared in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, ballpoint pen, rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.\n\nIn an August 2007 survey commissioned by the McCormick Tribune Foundation, Americans polled voted MacGyver as the favorite fictional hero they would want to have if they were ever caught in an emergency.\n\nIn 2007, the NBC sketch series \"Saturday Night Live\" featured a parody of \"MacGyver\" called \"MacGruber\" with Will Forte as the title character. The intros for these skits featured scenes from the \"MacGyver\" series. MacGruber and cohorts are always locked in a control room of some type with a bomb set to go off in 15–20 seconds. MacGruber has his co-stars hand him components to defuse the device, but something inevitably gets in the way (either situational, because MacGruber himself interferes, or because no one wants to touch what he has asked for) and the bomb detonates. In the March 7, 2009 installment of the \"MacGruber\" sketches, it was revealed that MacGyver is MacGruber's long-lost father. In 2010 the character was featured in its own R-rated spinoff movie, entitled \"MacGruber\"; the film was released by Rogue Pictures.\n\nIn February 2008, the science series \"MythBusters\" featured a \"MacGyver\" special which tested several of MacGyver's tactics. Of the seven tested only one (an ultralight plane can make a safe landing while gliding) was confirmed. In the final season's \"Explosion Special\" they busted filling a mail truck containing a bomb with wet concrete to contain the blast.\n\nIn 2008, the phrase \"What would MacGyver do?\" was used in a New Zealand television commercial for Gregg's \"freestyle cooking\" range of herbs and spices. The commercial featured the word MacGyver unfolding like a puzzle with a potato peeler and chopping knife opening out like the blades of a Swiss Army knife.\n\nIn 2016, the \"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" episode \"Emancipation\" has Daisy Johnson telling Lincoln Campbell (twice) that he has to \"MacGyver\" the door of his holding room to escape.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic has twice referenced the series in his songs – \"Couch Potato\" and \"Handy\" both mention MacGyver.\n\nMacGyver employs his resourcefulness and his knowledge of chemistry, physics, technology, and sportsmanship to resolve what are often life-or-death crises. He creates inventions from simple items to solve these problems. These inventions became synonymous with the character and were called MacGyverisms by fans. MacGyver was unlike secret agents in other television series and films because, instead of relying on high-tech weapons and tools, he carried only a Swiss Army knife and duct tape but never a gun.\n\nThis also led to the verb, \"to MacGyver\". \"MacGyverism\" was first used by Joanne Remmings (played by Pamela Bowen) in the third episode of Season 2. When MacGyver introduces himself to her, she uses the term in a manner that suggests other people had used it before:\n\nIn a 1989 interview with Richard Dean Anderson, Arsenio Hall said that he had heard the word \"MacGyver\" used as a verb meaning \"to do the impossible.\" Anderson then used it as an adjective meaning \"impossible.\" Anderson stated that his show's producers had just missed out on getting the word \"MacGyverism\" entered into the Webster's Dictionary and that \"we\" intended to try to get it in the next update. The word \"MacGyver\" however entered the Oxford Dictionaries in 2015 as a verb meaning \"make or repair (an object) in an improvised or inventive way, making use of whatever items are at hand\".\n\nThe show's writers based MacGyver's inventions on items they found on location, concepts from scientific advisers John Koivula and Jim Green, and real events. The show offered a monetary prize to people who sent good ideas for the show. A young fan suggested that MacGyver could patch up a vehicle's radiator by cracking an egg into it. The episode \"Bushmaster\" was constructed around this trick, and the fan was rewarded (producer Henry Winkler said in a 2005 NPR interview that this was his favorite \"MacGyverism\"). Although staff read every letter, few usable ideas were obtained in this way.\n\nIn October 2015, the original series' executive producer, Henry Winkler, signed on to produce a reboot series with James Wan and R. Scott Gemmill for CBS.\n\nIn March 2016, Lucas Till was announced as the new MacGyver, Joshua Boone as Gunner, MacGyver's best friend from high school, former \"\" star George Eads as Lincoln (later renamed as Jack Dalton), a man who could easily be written off as an eccentric conspiracy theorist but is a legitimate government employee with great capability for compassion, Addison Timlin as Mickey, an app developer who is aggressively progressive in her political views, with a soft spot for MacGyver, and Michelle Krusiec as Agent Croix, Lincoln’s sister who works for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn May 2016, the network picked up the series, with co-creator/exec producer Peter Lenkov to serve as showrunner. On May 18, 2016, CBS indicated that the new series would air in late 2016. In June 2016, however, the network scrapped the pilot and set Wan to direct the new pilot episode with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. Justin Hires was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver's roommate. In July 2016, \"Variety\" reported that Sandrine Holt is cast as Patricia Thornton, an ex-field agent who is now director of operations for the Department of External Services. Also that Tristin Mays was cast as Riley Davis, a highly unpredictable computer hacker with a chip on her shoulder. James Wan thinks they were lucky to find Lead actor Lucas Till who is one of the biggest discoveries with the show.\n\nAnderson reprised his role as MacGyver in September 2012 in a new series of short films, created by Mercedes-Benz for the launch of their new MPV Citan in Europe. The episodes were shot in Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 2012.\n\nIn the short film series, MacGyver now runs a mobile repair service with his daughter Caitlin. They go to a high-rise building to fix a faulty air conditioning system when terrorists incapacitate all of the occupants with knockout gas and take over the building. Despite his age, MacGyver uses his skills to overcome the knockout gas and follow the terrorists, discovering a military bunker below the basement. After the terrorists load a large crate into a van, MacGyver follows them in his Citan work van to a shipping yard, where the terrorists begin an exchange deal with another party. Inside the crate is a robot soldier, which goes haywire and kills everyone in sight. MacGyver then runs over the robot with his Citan and deactivates it to save the day.\n\nIn 2012, Tony Lee joined with MacGyver creator Lee David Zlotoff and technical advisor John Potter to write a 5-part comic book series of MacGyver titled \"MacGyver: Fugitive Gauntlets\". The story has a contemporary setting but retains all the major elements of the old show, including well known character Pete Thornton and the Phoenix Foundation as well as the much loved narration by the eponymous protagonist and MacGyverisms. The first issue was released October 10, 2012 with a new issue released each month ending with issue 5 on February 27, 2013.\n\nThe comic book was very well received around the world with the first issue selling out within the first two weeks and received mostly favorable reviews through major comic book sites. However, the series' lead author, Tony Lee, confirmed in September 2014 that the series in total did not sell well enough to warrant a second series.\n\n\n"}

It is used to explain variations in the effects in the consequences of behavior. Most importantly, a MO affects how strongly the person is reinforced or punished by the consequences of their behavior. For example, food deprivation is a motivating operation; if a person is hungry, food is strongly reinforcing, but if a person is satiated, food is less reinforcing. In 2003 Laraway suggested subdividing MOs into those that increase the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed establishing operations, and MOs that decrease the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed abolishing operations.\n\nThe concept of motivating operation deals with the observation that behavior depends not only on the stimuli present in the current situation and the organism's past experience with those stimuli, but also on the organism's recent past history of deprivation, satiation, pain, or other such influences. Such a past history can have two effects: it can change the value of a consequence by making it more or less reinforcing, and/or it can change the probability of behaviors that have produced that consequence. For example, food deprivation changes the value of food, making it more reinforcing, and it also evokes learned behaviors that have obtained food. Likewise, food satiation reduces the both the reinforcing effect of food and the probability of food-getting behaviors.\n\nNote that a motivating operation differs from a discriminative stimulus (Sd). A discriminative stimulus signals the availability of reinforcement, while a motivating operation changes the effectiveness of a reinforcer.\n\nNine main unconditioned (i.e. not learned) motivating operations, have been identified in humans. Deprivation of food, water, sleep, activity, or oxygen; becoming too warm or too cold; and increase of a painful stimulus all function as establishing operations for related behaviors, and increase the effect of positive or negative reinforcement related to them. Conversely, being satiated with food, water, sleep, activity, oxygen and sex; getting cooler after being too warm or warmer after too cold; and decrease of a painful stimulus all function as abolishing operations for related behavior and reinforcement.\n\nThere are also conditioned motivating operations that result from the learning history of the organism. Three kinds of conditioned operations have been identified: a surrogate, reflexive, and transitive. A surrogate MO has the same effect as the MO it was paired with when it was learned; a reflexive MO acts as a reinforcement when it is removed; a transitive MO make something else effective as reinforcement. It should be noted that there is some debate as to whether an organism can be deprived or satiated from conditioned reinforcers.\n\nThe concept of motivational operations has been applied to Maslow's hierarchy of needs by describing the lower two levels as involving unconditioned MOs and the upper three levels as involving conditioned MOs.\n"}

After serving as an educator and cultural activist for many years, she went to work in the government. She is currently a supranational delegate in the Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia.\n\nAdalberta Mónica Rey Gutiérrez was born on 23 April 1964 in Comunidad Marca, of the Nor Yungas Province, La Paz Department, Bolivia. She was raised in the Comunidad Santa Ana, near Coroico by her mother, Florentina Gutiérrez Barra, and step-father, Simeón Rey Barra. Rey moved to La Paz when she was eleven and continued her schooling at the boarding school Hogar y Colegio Ave María. She was the first Afro-Bolivian to graduate with a high school diploma from the school. Rey continued her education at the Higher University of San Andrés ()and earned a bachelor’s degree in social communications in 1997. Her thesis, \"La Saya como medio de comunicación y expresión cultural en la comunidad Afroboliviana\" (Saya as Mode of Communication and Cultural Expression in the Afro-Bolivian Community) was the first substantial work which had been extensively researched which analyzed the Afro-Bolivian segment of the population. In interviews with community elders, Rey discovered that members of the Yungas communities still had songs and ceremonies performed in African languages. The thesis evaluated the importance of \"saya\", a unique song and dance tradition to the identity of Afro-Bolivians, confirming that it was not a musical performance, but an integral part of their cultural expression. It became an important reference for both researchers who followed, and journalists.\n\nWhile still in college, Rey emerged as one of the leaders of the identity movement of Afro-Bolivians, which at that time was made up mostly of young people who had moved from the countryside to the capital for education or work. They began performing \"saya\" at public events and gained official recognition of their organization, the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement (), which was created in 1989 to revive and assert the cultural traditions of Afro-Bolivians. One of their first successes was to replace the vernacular way of referencing the people of African descent in Bolivia from being called \"negritos\" (dear/cute little blacks) or \"morenos\" (dark-colored people) to \"Afroboliviano\", recognizing that blacks were a distinct ethnic group but also Bolivian. In 1994, she led a march on the presidential palace to gain recognition for Afro-Bolivians. Rey, one of the founders of the organization, served as president of MCSA from 1996 to 2001. \n\nAlmost immediately after her graduation, Rey began working with a group of team members on a project sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank to conduct research and survey conditions throughout the country effecting the Afro-Bolivian population. Their findings reported as, \"Diagnóstico de la situación del pueblo negro en Bolivia\" (Diagnostic of the Situation of the Black Community in Bolivia), estimated for the first time the size of that segment of the population to be around 20,000. Another booklet, \"El tambor mayor\" (The main drum), written in conjunction with the Fundación Simón y Patiño, was produced in 1998 by Rey, who coordinated a group effort written on the culture and history of Afro-Bolivians. That same year, Rey took a position in the General Directorate of Archaeology and Anthropology, leaving after one year to teach at the (UniFranz). After five years, she left UniFranz and in 2004 began teaching at her alma mater, UMSA.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2009, Rey participated in and led workshops at many international events related to the African diaspora traveling to Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru, the United States, Uruguay and Venezuela. She also served as the Bolivian representative at numerous meetings of African American organizations throughout the continent. In 2009, Rey accepted a post in the Ministry of Culture became the Director General of the Fight Against Racism within the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization. The following year, she became an advisor to the Office of the Ministry of Productive Development and Plural Economy and at the same time, Afro-Bolivians were allowed to participate in the government and as part of the Departmental Council. They formed the National Council of Afro-Bolivians () on which Rey served as secretary of communication and international relations. In 2012, for the first time Bolivians of African descent were enumerated on the national population census as a specific ethnic group. Census data, which counted citizens over age fifteen, showed that the Afro-Bolivian sector represented 16,329 people compared to the 10 million people in the entire population.\n\nIn 2014 Rey became Director General of Consumer Protection in the Ministry of Productive Development and was elected as supranational deputy in the Chamber of Deputies of the administration of President Evo Morales. She introduced legislation in 2016 to protect the human and civil rights of the African community in Bolivia including anti-discrimination provisions.\n\nRey has published articles both nationally and internationally in journals as well as having been the subject of interview for other researchers and journalists on Afro-Bolivian themes. She is one of the few authors who have created major reference works on Afro-Bolivian people.\n\n"}

{"id": "773546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=773546", "title": "No taxation without representation", "text": "No taxation without representation\n\n\"No taxation without representation\" is a slogan originating during the 1700s that summarized a primary grievance of the American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies, which was one of the major causes of the American Revolution. In short, many in those colonies believed that, as they were not directly represented in the distant British Parliament, any laws it passed affecting the colonists (such as the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act) were illegal under the Bill of Rights 1689, and were a denial of their rights as Englishmen.\n\nJonathan Mayhew, Old West Church's second Congregational pastor, used the phrase, \"no taxation without representation\" in a sermon in 1750. The phrase revives a sentiment central to the cause of the English Civil War following the refusal of parliamentarian John Hampden to pay ship money tax. \"No taxation without representation,\" in the context of British American Colonial taxation, appeared for the first time in the February 1768 \"London Magazine\" headline, on page 89, in the printing of Lord Camden’s \"Speech on the Declaratory Bill of the Sovereignty of Great Britain over the Colonies.\"\n\nThe English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660. By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right. The English Bill of Rights 1689 had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament. Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. Parliament initially contended that the colonists had virtual representation, but the idea \"found little support on either side of the Atlantic\". John Dunmore Lang wrote in 1852, \"The person who first suggested the idea [of Parliamentary representation for the colonies] appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I. It was afterwards put forward with approbation by the celebrated Dr. Adam Smith, and advocated for a time, but afterwards rejected and strongly opposed, by Dr. Benjamin Franklin.\"\n\nThe eloquent 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance objecting to taxation, written by the Virginia House of Burgesses and endorsed by every other Colony, was sent to the British Government, which seems to have ignored it.\n\nThe phrase had been used for more than a generation in Ireland. By 1765, the term was in use in Boston, and local politician James Otis was most famously associated with the phrase, \"taxation without representation is tyranny.\" In the course of the Revolutionary era (1750–1783), many arguments were pursued that sought to resolve the dispute surrounding Parliamentary sovereignty, taxation, self-governance and representation.\n\nIn the course of the 1760s and 1770s, William Pitt the Elder, Sir William Pulteney, and George Grenville, amongst other prominent Britons and colonial Americans, such as Joseph Galloway, James Otis Jr., Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, the London Quaker Thomas Crowley, Royal Governors such as Thomas Pownall M.P., William Franklin, Sir Francis Bernard, and the Attorney-General of Quebec, Francis Maseres, debated and circulated plans for the creation of colonial seats in London, imperial union with Great Britain, or a federally representative British Parliament with powers of taxation that was to consist of American, West Indian, Irish and British Members of Parliament. Despite the fact that these ideas were considered and discussed seriously on both sides of the Atlantic, it appears that neither the American Congress, nor the colonial Assemblies, nor the British Government in Westminster, at least prior to the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, officially proposed such constitutional developments. It must be noted, however, that Governor Thomas Hutchinson apparently referred to a colonial representational proposal when he wrote that, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay...was the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764...And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons...an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet...it was renounced...by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable.\n\nJared Ingersoll Snr., colonial agent for Connecticut, wrote to his American colleague, the Royal Governor of Connecticut Thomas Fitch, that following Isaac Barre's famous Parliamentary speech against the Stamp Act in 1764, Richard Jackson, M.P., supported Barre and other pro-American M.P.s by producing before the House copies of earlier Acts of Parliament that had admitted Durham and Chester seats upon their petitions for representation. The argument was put forward in Parliament that America ought to have representatives on these grounds too. Richard Jackson supposed that Parliament had a right to tax America, but he much doubted the expediency of the Stamp act. He said if it was necessary, as ministers claimed, to tax the colonies, the latter should be permitted to elect some part of the Parliament, \"otherwise the liberties of America, I do not say will be lost, but will be in danger.\"\n\nWilliam Knox, an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament. He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, \"The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed\", Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation. Knox submitted that, whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed...The truth...is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament...and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament's] legislative acts...are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes...The colony advocates...tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they...mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.\n\nEdmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up \"The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed\" as well as \"The Present State of the Nation\" (1768) under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract \"Observations on a Late State of the Nation\" (1769), NOW comes [Knox's] American representation...Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.\n\nWhile Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.\n\nBurke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain. Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled \"On American Taxation\", Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking, What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote? You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful...My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.\n\nHowever, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that, The Parliament of Great Britain...is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary]...superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in waar,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, \"Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you.\" This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.\n\nThe views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy \"internal\" taxes \"for the purposes of raising a revenue\" without the consent of actual representatives of the \"Commons of America\". \"It is my opinion,\" Pitt said, \"that this kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies.\"\n\nIn 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that, \n\nOtis, Jr., attended the Continental Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates. The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had \"a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists\" and that \"the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature.\" Furthermore, it was declared that, \"it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists.\"\n\nDaniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in 1765 that, \"the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons.\" Dulany, Jr., denied that Parliament had a right \"to impose an internal Tax upon the Colonies, without their consent for the single Purpose of Revenue.\"\n\nIn 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, \"an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\nFor those sympathetic to republicanism, such as James Burgh, Catherine Macauley, and Richard Price, any tax revenue measures that were voted into effect without the direct representation of Americans were \"unconstitutional\" and \"pernicious\". Burgh felt that virtual representation was \"subversive of liberty\" and \"unjust in its principles\" and that the House of Commons must include colonial representatives when it voted on colonial matters, or operate by using the consent of the colonial Assemblies.\n\nThe Americans rejected the Stamp Act of 1765 brought in by British Prime Minister George Grenville, and violently rejected the remaining tax on tea imports, under the Tea Act passed in May 1773, at the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773. The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the Crown-in-Parliament. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming militias and seized political control of each colony, ousting the royal governors – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.\n\nThe complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though ubiquitous), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in London, i.e. without representation for the colonists in British Parliament.\n\nPatrick Henry's resolution in the Virginia legislature implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the British Constitution, and that Virginia alone had the right to tax Virginians.\n\nThis offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication \"A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans\". In February 1775, Britain passed the Conciliatory Resolution which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.\n\nJames Macpherson, a colonial secretary of British West Florida, defended the North administration in an officially sponsored polemic in 1776 named \"The Rights of Great Britain Asserted\". This work replied to the Continental Congress' July 6, 1775 \"Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms\" by proposing that, Had the Americans, instead of flying to arms, submitted the same supposed grievance [as the taxed though unrepresented Palatine counties in England had], in a peaceable and dutiful manner, to the Legislature, I can perceive no reason why their request should be refused. Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that \"for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;\" this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects...The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation [sic], can meet no compromise.\" The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication \"Wealth of Nations\" when he recommended the Americans \"to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament\" on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.\n\nWriting in October 1776 to Lord North in \"Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress\" of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet \"Rights of the British Colonies\" and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable.\" Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that \"local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament\". The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778. In that year \"the commissioners of the king of Great Britain,\" known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of \"a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain\".\n\nIn Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry. This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life. Therefore the British government tried to argue that the colonists had virtual representation in their interests. In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, invented the doctrine of 'virtual representation' in an attempt extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimise the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act. In English history, \"no taxation without representation\" was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the \"representation\" was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a \"virtual representation.\" \"We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection,\" declared Samuel Johnson in his political pamphlet \"Taxation No Tyranny\". He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. \"They are represented,\" he said, \"by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England.\" However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was \"sophistry\" and \"a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [\"sic\"] the weak.\" The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have \"usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history.\"\n\nVirtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also who said the \"virtual\" was a cover for political corruption and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. In 1765, the American lawyer and politician James Otis, Jr., responded to Soame Jenyns' \"The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies, by the Legislature of Great Britain, Briefly Considered\". Otis' own publication was entitled \"Considerations on Behalf of the Colonists, in a Letter to a Noble Lord\". He wrote in it, \"To what purpose is it to ring everlasting changes to the colonists on the cases of Manchester, Birmingham and Sheffield, who return no members? If those now so considerable places are not represented, they ought to be.\" Writing in his 1763 publication \"The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved\", Otis declared that,\nEvery British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights...which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away...[are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them...[that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly ’till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others...Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both...[Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.\n\nOtis simultaneously refuted, in \"The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved\", a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the colonial agents' alleged influence on British policy. \"As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents,\" he wrote,\nI know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.\n\nColonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even \"If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold,\" said Daniel Dulany, \"not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain.\" The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.\n\nThe argument between the colonies and Parliament sought to resolve how the British 'commoners' of the various part of the Empire were represented most constitutionally – as Daniel Dulaney, an American Loyalist and lawyer, put it \"[the] constitutional authority [of Parliament's rights to bind American subjects] depends upon the single question, Whether the Commons of Great-Britain are virtually the representatives of the Commons of America, or not.\n\nThe theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, and his ally William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the '\"Commons of America\" without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, \"even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated.\" He then said, I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent.\"\n\nIn his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of \"no taxation without representation\" Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, Chief Justice James Mansfield, Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington, and others. He responded:[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. … My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. … [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. … I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, ‘What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?’\"In an appearance before Parliament in January, 1766, former Prime Minister William Pitt stated:\nThe idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.\n\nGrenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America \"border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution.\" External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.\n\nIn the 1860s, suffragette Sarah E. Wall of Worcester, Massachusetts invoked the principle of \"no taxation without representation\", initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were granted the right to vote. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863. In \"Wheeler v. Wall,\" the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes. In 1884, Susan B. Anthony cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, \"for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes.\"\n\nThe phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes (sales, income, property) but lack the ability to vote, such as felons (who are, in many states, barred from voting), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don't live in), or people under 18.\n\nTo become citizens of the United States, immigrants most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually 5 years). Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot vote. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship. Throughout U.S. history, non-citizens have been allowed to vote in 40 U.S. states and territories. As of 2005, non-citizens are allowed to vote in seven jurisdictions in the United States: Chicago and six towns in Montgomery County, Maryland.\n\nIn 2009, the phrase \"taxation without representation\" was also used in the Tea Party protests, where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.\n\nA modified version of the phrase, \"no tuition without representation\", is sometimes used in disputes over governance in higher education in the United States to emphasize student's rights to a voice in institutional decisions. The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at Union County College in New Jersey. It has been used more recently in disputes at Dartmouth College, UC Berkeley School of Law, and elsewhere.\nIn the United States, the phrase is used in Washington, D.C. as part of the campaign for a vote in Congress, to publicize the fact that Washington residents pay Federal taxes, but do not have representation in Congress. In November 2000, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles began issuing license plates bearing the slogan \"Taxation without representation\". In a show of support for the city, President Bill Clinton used the \"Taxation Without Representation\" plates on the presidential limousine; however, President George W. Bush had the tags replaced to those without the motto shortly after taking office. President Barack Obama announced his intention to use the plates with the motto beginning at his second inauguration. President Donald Trump continued usage of the plates with the protest motto after he was elected, though he has stated he has \"no position\" on the issue of granting D.C. statehood.\n\nIn 2002, the Council of the District of Columbia authorized adding the slogan to the D.C. flag, but no new flag design was approved. In 2007, the District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters program was created based on the successful 50 State Quarters program. DC submitted designs containing the slogan, but they were rejected by the U.S. Mint.\n\nBritish Prime Minister John Major used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the United Nations's 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, \"It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation,\" in order to criticize the billion-dollar arrears of the United States' payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.\n\nIn Canada, Québec politician Gilles Duceppe, former leader of the Bloc Québécois, has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in Ottawa. The Bloc is a Québec sovereigntist party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec. Duceppe's evocation of the phrase implies that the proponents of Quebec's sovereigntist movement have the right to be represented in the body (which they are), the Canadian Parliament, which levies taxes upon them. He will usually cite the sentence in its original English.\n\nThe first government of South Australia was by a legislative council, whose members were chosen by the Crown and from which office-bearers \"Official Members\" were selected by the Governor. John Stephens and his \"South Australian Register\" were among those who campaigned for democratic reform. Partial reform took place in 1851, when a majority of Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1851–1855 were elected.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5801344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5801344", "title": "Normalization (sociology)", "text": "Normalization (sociology)\n\nNormalization refers to social processes through which ideas and actions come to be seen as 'normal' and become taken-for-granted or 'natural' in everyday life. In sociological theory, normalization appears in two forms.\nFirst, the concept of normalization is found in the work of Michel Foucault, especially \"Discipline and Punish\", in the context of his account of disciplinary power. As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct – for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail – and then rewarding or punishing individuals for respectively conforming to or deviating from this ideal. In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum social control with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls \"disciplinary power\". Disciplinary power emerged over the course of the 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of social structure in modern societies.\n\nSecond, normalization process theory is a middle-range theory used mainly in medical sociology and science and technology studies to provide a framework for understanding the social processes by which new ways of thinking, working and organizing become routinely incorporated in everyday work. Normalization process theory has its roots in empirical studies of technological innovation in healthcare, and especially in the evaluation of complex interventions.\n\nThere are different behavioral attitudes humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in cannibalism.\n\nThe world is constantly changing and many things can change the situation an individual is in. Many influences such as past experiences, environment, mental strength, physical strength, people, and the media can affect a person's behavior. A person can decide to let certain things influence them. This will determine if the person is able to make a decision rationally or not. Some people fail to see the effects of their actions after letting influences affect their actions.\n\nPeople can greatly be affected by their mood. One's judgement and emotional well-being is influenced by one's mood. A negative mood can cause someone to be unproductive and it will show in the person's performance. Positive moods can make a person be more active and productive. If the person is well emotion-wise, they are full of energy and are able to stay positive.\n\nChildren are known for developing behaviors based on family, friends and media influences. A child may not know what they were doing is right or wrong. They must be able to learn from experiences if their actions are right or wrong. It is the parent's job to teach the child whether it is socially accepted or not. As the child develops from a child to a young adult, most of their influence will come from their friends. It will become harder for parents to tell how the child behaves as the child grows older.\n\nYoung adults and teenagers are heavily affected by looking up to role models. Young adults are influenced to act, talk, dress and behave similarly to their role models. This can either be a positive or negative for the individual. Looking up to a role model can have positive effects, as may influence young adults to strive for success and it brings the best out of the person to do well. Positive role models are people able to overcome obstacles, inspire others, and achievements of success. However, negative role models may model bad behaviors like bullying, drug usage, and cheating, which may lead to failure rather than success. Young adults may learn to avoid problems rather than solve them. The problems with blindly copying a role model is that people start to lose a sense of identity.\n\nGrief is the deep sorrow usually caused by someone's death. It has now become a normal human reaction to a loss of a loved one. It is not uncommon for someone to be in sadness. Many have to deal with coping with grief.\n\nBody markings such as tattoos and piercings were once considered unaccepted, many people today use body markings as a form of expression. It is not uncommon to see doctors, lawyers, soldiers, police officers, and other professionals to have them.\n\nDuring the 1900s homosexuality was not accepted as a normal behavior and people attracted to the same gender were considered different and were heavily discriminated against. Over the years, it has now been accepted in places such as the United States, Canada and other places around the world.\n\nLaughter signals acceptance and trust in a group. This is often why laughter is contagious, and explains why people are unlikely to laugh alone.\n\nAbnormal behavior is broken up to two types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical behavior is not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could potentially be harmful.\n"}

{"id": "649382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649382", "title": "Pareidolia", "text": "Pareidolia\n\nPareidolia ( ) is a psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus, usually an image or a sound, by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists.\n\nCommon examples are perceived images of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, the Man in the Moon, the Moon rabbit, hidden messages in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing indistinct voices in random noise such as that produced by air conditioners or fans.\n\nThe word derives from the Greek words \"para\" (παρά, \"beside, alongside, instead [of]\" — in this context meaning something faulty or wrong) and the noun \"eidōlon\" (εἴδωλον \"image, form, shape\" — the diminutive of \"eidos\").\n\nPareidolia can cause people to interpret random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area at a time and location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.\n\nThese studies help to explain why people identify a few circles and a line as a \"face\" so quickly and without hesitation. Cognitive processes are activated by the \"face-like\" object, which alert the observer to both the emotional state and identity of the subject, even before the conscious mind begins to process or even receive the information. A \"stick figure face\", despite its simplicity, can convey mood information, and be drawn to indicate emotions such as happiness or anger. This robust and subtle capability is hypothesized to be the result of eons of natural selection favoring people most able to quickly identify the mental state, for example, of threatening people, thus providing the individual an opportunity to flee or attack pre-emptively. In other words, processing this information subcortically — therefore subconsciously — before it is passed on to the rest of the brain for detailed processing accelerates judgment and decision making when a fast reaction is needed. This ability, though highly specialized for the processing and recognition of \"human\" emotions, also functions to determine the demeanor of wildlife.\n\nPareidolia can be considered a subcategory of Apophenia.\n\nRocks may come to mimic recognizable forms through the random processes of formation, weathering and erosion. Most often, the size scale of the rock is larger than the object it resembles, such as a cliff profile resembling a human face. Well-meaning people with a new interest in fossils can pick up chert nodules, concretions or pebbles resembling bones, skulls, turtle shells, dinosaur eggs, etc., in both size and shape.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese researcher Chonosuke Okamura self-published a series of reports titled \"Original Report of the Okamura Fossil Laboratory\", in which he described tiny inclusions in polished limestone from the Silurian period (425 mya) as being preserved fossil remains of tiny humans, gorillas, dogs, dragons, dinosaurs and other organisms, all of them only millimeters long, leading him to claim, \"There have been no changes in the bodies of mankind since the Silurian period... except for a growth in stature from 3.5 mm to 1,700 mm.\" Okamura's research earned him an Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prizes) in biodiversity in 1996.\n\nThe Rorschach inkblot test uses pareidolia in an attempt to gain insight into a person's mental state. The Rorschach is a projective test, as it intentionally elicits the thoughts or feelings of respondents that are \"projected\" onto the ambiguous inkblot images.\n\nIn his notebooks, Leonardo da Vinci wrote of pareidolia as a device for painters, writing, \"If you look at any walls spotted with various stains or with a mixture of different kinds of stones, if you are about to invent some scene you will be able to see in it a resemblance to various different landscapes adorned with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys, and various groups of hills. You will also be able to see divers combats and figures in quick movement, and strange expressions of faces, and outlandish costumes, and an infinite number of things which you can then reduce into separate and well conceived forms.\"\n\nTwo 13th century edifices in Turkey display architectural use of shadows of stone carvings at the entrance. Outright pictures are avoided in Islam but tessellations and calligraphic pictures were allowed, so \"accidental\" silhouettes became a creative escape. \n\nThere have been many instances of perceptions of religious imagery and themes, especially the faces of religious figures, in ordinary phenomena. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, the word Allah, or other religious phenomena: in September 2007 in Singapore, for example, a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers to pay homage to the \"Monkey god\" (either Sun Wukong or Hanuman) in the monkey tree phenomenon.\n\nPublicity surrounding sightings of religious figures and other surprising images in ordinary objects has spawned a market for such items on online auctions like eBay. One famous instance was a grilled cheese sandwich with the face of the Virgin Mary.\n\nPareidolia also arises in computer vision, specifically in image recognition programs, which can spuriously detect features. In the case of an artificial neural network, higher-level features correspond to more recognizable features, and enhancing these features brings out what the computer sees. These reflect the training set of images that the network has \"seen\" previously.\n\nStriking visuals can be produced in this way, notably in the DeepDream software, which falsely detects and then exaggerates features such as eyes and faces in any image.\n\nIn 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote \"Breakthrough\", detailing what he believed was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP has been described as auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect what is on the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.\n\nVarious European ancient divination practices involved the interpretation of shadows cast by objects. For example, in molybdomancy, a random shape produced by pouring molten tin into cold water is interpreted by the shadow it casts in candlelight.\n\nA shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is often attributed to pareidolia. It is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity. \n\nPareidolia is also what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have seen ghosts. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "25005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25005", "title": "Peano axioms", "text": "Peano axioms\n\nIn mathematical logic, the Peano axioms, also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of metamathematical investigations, including research into fundamental questions of whether number theory is consistent and complete.\n\nThe need to formalize arithmetic was not well appreciated until the work of Hermann Grassmann, who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction. In 1881, Charles Sanders Peirce provided an axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic. In 1888, Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural-number arithmetic, and in 1889, Peano published a simplified version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, \"The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method\" ().\n\nThe Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set of natural numbers. The next four are general statements about equality; in modern treatments these are often not taken as part of the Peano axioms, but rather as axioms of the \"underlying logic\". The next three axioms are first-order statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a second order statement of the principle of mathematical induction over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called Peano arithmetic is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the second-order induction axiom with a first-order axiom schema.\n\nWhen Peano formulated his axioms, the language of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the \"Begriffsschrift\" by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of Boole and Schröder.\n\nThe Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of \"natural numbers\", usually represented as a set N or formula_1 The non-logical symbols for the axioms consist of a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol \"S\".\n\nThe first axiom states that the constant 0 is a natural number:\n\nThe next four axioms describe the equality relation. Since they are logically valid in first-order logic with equality, they are not considered to be part of \"the Peano axioms\" in modern treatments.\n\nThe remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued \"successor\" function \"S\".\n\nPeano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the \"first\" natural number. This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the additive identity in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 define a unary representation of the intuitive notion of natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as \"S\"(0), 2 as \"S\"(\"S\"(0)), etc. However, considering the notion of natural numbers as being defined by these axioms, axioms 1, 6, 7, 8 do not imply that the successor function generates all the natural numbers different from 0. Put differently, they do not guarantee that every natural number other than zero must succeed some other natural number.\n\nThe intuitive notion that each natural number can be obtained by applying \"successor\" sufficiently often to zero requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the \"axiom of induction\".\n\nThe induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:\nIn Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a second-order axiom. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker first-order induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section below.\n\nThe Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of addition and multiplication and the usual total (linear) ordering on N. The respective functions and relations are constructed in set theory or second-order logic, and can be shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.\n\nAddition is a function that maps two natural numbers (two elements of N) to another one. It is defined recursively as:\n\nFor example:\n\nThe structure is a commutative monoid with identity element 0. is also a cancellative magma, and thus embeddable in a group. The smallest group embedding N is the integers.\n\nSimilarly, multiplication is a function mapping two natural numbers to another one. Given addition, it is defined recursively as:\n\nIt is easy to see that \"S\"(0) (or \"1\", in the familiar language of decimal representation) is the multiplicative right identity:\n\nTo show that \"S\"(0) is also the multiplicative left identity requires the induction axiom due to the way multiplication is defined:\n\n\nTherefore by the induction axiom \"S\"(0) is the multiplicative left identity of all natural numbers. Moreover, it can be shown that multiplication distributes over addition:\n\nThus, is a commutative semiring.\n\nThe usual total order relation ≤ on natural numbers can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:\n\nThis relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for formula_5, if , then:\n\n\nThus, the structure is an ordered semiring; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring.\n\nThe axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following form that uses a stronger hypothesis, making use of the order relation \"≤\":\n\nThis form of the induction axiom, called \"strong induction\", is a consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are well-ordered—every nonempty subset of N has a least element—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty be given and assume \"X\" has no least element.\n\n\nThus, by the strong induction principle, for every , . Thus, , which contradicts \"X\" being a nonempty subset of N. Thus \"X\" has a least element.\n\nAll of the Peano axioms except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), but it can be transformed into a first-order \"axiom schema\" of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.\n\nFirst-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.\n\nThe following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality), which contains six of the seven axioms of Robinson arithmetic, is sufficient for this purpose:\n\n\nIn addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a countably infinite set of axioms. For each formula in the language of Peano arithmetic, the first-order induction axiom for \"φ\" is the sentence\n\nwhere formula_13 is an abbreviation for \"y\"...,\"y\". The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula \"φ\".\n\nThere are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.\n\nThe theory defined by these axioms is known as PA; the theory PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema. An important property of PA is that any structure formula_29 satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by formula_30) isomorphic to formula_31. Elements in that segment are called standard elements, while other elements are called nonstandard elements.\n\nA model of the Peano axioms is a triple , where N is a (necessarily infinite) set, and satisfies the axioms above. Dedekind proved in his 1888 book, \"The Nature and Meaning of Numbers\" (, i.e., “What are the numbers and what are they good for?”) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are isomorphic. In particular, given two models and of the Peano axioms, there is a unique homomorphism satisfying\n\nand it is a bijection. This means that the second-order Peano axioms are categorical. This is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.\n\nThe Peano axioms can be derived from set theoretic constructions of the natural numbers and axioms of set theory such as ZF. The standard construction of the naturals, due to John von Neumann, starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator \"s\" on sets defined as:\n\nThe set of natural numbers N is defined as the intersection of all sets closed under \"s\" that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:\n\nand so on. The set N together with 0 and the successor function satisfies the Peano axioms.\n\nPeano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.\n\nThe Peano axioms can also be understood using category theory. Let \"C\" be a category with terminal object 1, and define the category of pointed unary systems, US(\"C\") as follows:\n\n\nThen \"C\" is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US(\"C\") has an initial object; this initial object is known as a natural number object in \"C\". If is this initial object, and is any other object, then the unique map is such that\n\nThis is precisely the recursive definition of 0 and \"S\".\n\nAlthough the usual natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other models as well (called \"non-standard models\"); the compactness theorem implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.\n\nWhen interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.\n\nIt is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. The answer is affirmative as Skolem in 1933 provided an explicit construction of such a nonstandard model. On the other hand, Tennenbaum's theorem, proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is computable. This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible order type of a countable nonstandard model. Letting \"ω\" be the order type of the natural numbers, \"ζ\" be the order type of the integers, and \"η\" be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is , which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.\n\nA cut in a nonstandard model \"M\" is a nonempty subset \"I\" of \"M\" so that \"I\" is downward closed ( \"x\"<\"y\" and \"y\"∈\"I\" implies \"x\"∈\"I\") and \"I\" is closed under successor. A proper cut is a cut that is a proper subset of \"M\". Each nonstandard model has many proper cuts, including one that corresponds to the standard natural numbers. However, the induction scheme in Peano arithmetic prevents any proper cut from being definable. The overspill lemma, first proved by Abraham Robinson, formalizes this fact. \n\nWhen the Peano axioms were first proposed, Bertrand Russell and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a \"natural number\". Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were \"consistent\"; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their consistency using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.\n\nAlthough it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958, Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using type theory. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using transfinite induction up to an ordinal called ε. Gentzen explained: \"The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles\". Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a Turing machine describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.\n\nThe vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as Gentzen's proof. A small number of philosophers and mathematicians, some of whom also advocate ultrafinitism, reject Peano's axioms because accepting the axioms amounts to accepting the infinite collection of natural numbers. In particular, addition (including the successor function) and multiplication are assumed to be total. Curiously, there are self-verifying theories that are similar to PA but have subtraction and division instead of addition and multiplication, which are axiomatized in such a way to avoid proving sentences that correspond to the totality of addition and multiplication, but which are still able to prove all true formula_40 theorems of PA, and yet can be extended to a consistent theory that proves its own consistency (stated as the non-existence of a Hilbert-style proof of \"0=1\").\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191101", "title": "Phase space", "text": "Phase space\n\nIn dynamical system theory, a phase space is a space in which all possible states of a system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. For mechanical systems, the phase space usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum variables. The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri Poincaré, and Willard Gibbs.\n\nIn a phase space, every degree of freedom or parameter of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is called a phase line, while a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane. For every possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the system's parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The system's evolving state over time traces a path (a phase space trajectory for the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular initial condition, located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from \"any\" initial condition. As a whole, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle's \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation - e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a robotic arm or determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.\n\nIn classical mechanics, any choice of generalized coordinates \"q\" for the position (i.e. coordinates on configuration space) defines conjugate generalized momenta \"p\" which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the cotangent bundle of configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local Darboux coordinates for the standard symplectic structure on a cotangent space.\n\nThe motion of an ensemble of systems in this space is studied by classical statistical mechanics. The local density of points in such systems obeys Liouville's Theorem, and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a model system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamic variables. Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or Lagrange's equations of motion.\n\nFor simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom occurs when one has an autonomous ordinary differential equation in a single variable, formula_1 with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a phase line, and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the exponential growth model/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the logistic growth model (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).\n\nThe phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a phase plane, which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension, and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch of the phase portrait may give qualitative information about the dynamics of the system, such as the limit cycle of the Van der Pol oscillator shown in the diagram.\n\nHere, the horizontal axis gives the position and vertical axis the velocity. As the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the phase diagram.\nClassic examples of phase diagrams from chaos theory are :\n\nA plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a phase plot or a phase diagram. Phase diagram, however, is more usually reserved in the physical sciences for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of pressure, temperature, and composition.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the coordinates \"p\" and \"q\" of phase space normally become hermitian operators in a Hilbert space.\n\nBut they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through Groenewold's 1946 star product), consistent with the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. \nEvery quantum mechanical observable corresponds to a unique function or distribution on phase space, and vice versa, as specified by Hermann Weyl (1927) and supplemented by John von Neumann (1931); Eugene Wigner (1932); and, in a grand synthesis, by H J Groenewold (1946). \nWith J E Moyal (1949), these completed the foundations of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics. (Its modern abstractions include deformation quantization and geometric quantization.)\nExpectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the Wigner quasi-probability distribution effectively serving as a measure.\n\nThus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the Weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a deformation (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter \"ħ/S\", where \"S\" is the action of the relevant process. (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics, with deformation parameter \"v\"/\"c\"; or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into General Relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild radius/characteristic-dimension.)\n\nClassical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by ħ-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.\n\nIn thermodynamics and statistical mechanics contexts, the term phase space has two meanings: It is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a thermodynamic system consists of \"N\" particles, then a point in the 6\"N\"-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system, as each particle is associated with three position variables and three momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are distinguishable, a point in phase space is said to be a microstate of the system. (For indistinguishable particles a microstate will consist of a set of \"N\"<nowiki>!</nowiki> points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the \"N\" particles.) \"N\" is typically on the order of Avogadro's number, thus describing the system at a microscopic level is often impractical. This leads to the use of phase space in a different sense.\n\nThe phase space can also refer to the space that is parametrized by the \"macroscopic\" states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For instance, one may view the pressure-volume diagram or entropy-temperature diagrams as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in, for example, the liquid phase, or solid phase, etc.\n\nSince there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the first sense is usually a manifold of much larger dimensions than in the second sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say, the temperature or the pressure of the system.\n\nPhase space is extensively used in nonimaging optics, the branch of optics devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in Hamiltonian optics.\n\nIn classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the partition function (sum over states) known as the phase integral. Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined by\nappropriate integer quantum numbers for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space. Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space). Once the phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of quantum energy states per unit phase space. This normalization constant is simply the inverse of Planck's constant raised to a power equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the system.\n\n\n"}

The website sought to call attention to what it alleged to be systemic societal corruption in the CNMI. It was in existence between 2001 and September 2014, and was reported on in a variety of ways in local, regional, and international newsprint and magazine outlets, on ABC Radio Australia, and Internet forums and blogs. The website was the subject of intense debate and scrutiny by the CNMI government, which threatened to sue the website's author.\nIn contrast, the site's author is celebrated in the 2012 novel \"The Master Blaster\" by writer and former Saipan Peace Corps Volunteer P. F. Kluge.\n\n\"Saipan Sucks\" seeks to call attention to what it alleges to be systemic societal problems in the CNMI that are supported by misuse of United States taxpayer money. Press outlets have quoted the following excerpt from the website:\nNepotism rules on the islands. Fueled by money paid by American taxpayers and diverted to the far-off territory, politicians run for office primarily for the sake of being in a position to appoint their relatives to high-paying sinecures.\n\nThe website presents allegations of corruption, racism, nepotism, jury-rigging, worker exploitation, employment discrimination, and mismanagement of the CNMI tourism industry by local CNMI officials, and seeks to warn U.S. mainlanders about moving to the islands to accept employment offers.\n\nSince July 2001, shortly after \"Saipan Sucks\" was created, CNMI government officials criticized the website's anonymity and characterized it as a \"smear campaign\". Stemming from its reported investigations, the CNMI government has threatened to sue the website's author for libel or defamation. The website author's response to the CNMI government was to state that they have \"apparently never heard of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution … Is it possible the investigators don't recognize political and social commentary when they see it?\"\n\nIn November 2006, a local environmental group, Beautify CNMI!, decried the website's high PageRank in search engines such as Google, and the fact that anyone who searches with the keyword \"Saipan\" could find the website in the top-ten search result positions. The group published a plan to counter the website's ranking through a campaign of linkspamming via Google bombing and text anchoring.\n\nAll along, counter-critics who are either Chamorros (indigenous people of Saipan) or those otherwise knowledgeable about the CNMI have maintained that, although \"Saipan Sucks\" uses hyperbole as a literary device, much or most of what it states is true and should be heeded.\n\n\"Saipan Sucks\" was written by a person or persons going by the pseudonym \"Forgetabilia\". Reported investigations carried out by the CNMI government in July 2001 led to an alleged belief about a real identity behind this persona. Later, on November 16, 2006, a CNMI daily alleged that \"Saipan Sucks\" was written by a former CNMI Assistant Attorney General, who the daily reported as having \"disliked his position\" in the CNMI. The same day, a regional publication denied the claim, reiterating that the author or authors remain anonymous. \"Saipan Sucks\" closes by stating, \"As for the authors of this essay, our days in Micronesia have ended … In all likelihood we shall remain happily for the rest of our days ensconced in anonymous Longnesia, suffering, with a little luck, from a selective am-nesia. Hence our name – Forgetabilia.\"\n\nAs of September 10, 2014, the website was no longer available. However, it has been reposted under the URL saipansucks.weebly.com\n\n\n"}

The widths of the bands are directly proportional to energy production, utilization and losses. The primary energy sources are gas, electricity and coal/oil and represent energy inputs at the left hand side of the Sankey diagram. They can also visualize the energy accounts, material flow accounts on a regional or national level, and also the breakdown of cost of item or services.\n\nSankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on the major transfers or flows within a system. They are helpful in locating dominant contributions to an overall flow. Often, Sankey diagrams show conserved quantities within defined system boundaries.\n\nSankey diagrams are named after Irish Captain Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey, who used this type of diagram in 1898 in a classic figure (see panel on the right) showing the energy efficiency of a steam engine. While the first charts in black and white were merely used to display one type of flow (e.g. steam), using colors for different types of flows has added more degrees of freedom to Sankey diagrams.\n\nOne of the most famous Sankey diagrams is Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a flow map, overlaying a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's 'first' Sankey diagram of 1898.\n\nSankey diagrams are often used in fields of science, especially physics. They are used to represent energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output.\n\nThe United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) produces numerous Sankey diagrams annually in its \"Annual Energy Review\" which illustrate the production and consumption of various forms of energy. \n\nEurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, has developed an interactive Sankey web tool to visualise energy data by means of flow diagrams. The tool allows the building and customisation of diagrams by playing with different options (country, year, fuel, level of detail).\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) created an interactive Sankey web application] that details the flow of energy for the entire planet. Users can select specific countries, points of time back to 1973, and modify the arrangement of various flows within the Sankey diagram.\n\nThe US Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory maintains a site of Sankey diagrams, including US energy flow and carbon flow.\n\nBen Schmidt, an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University, created a Sankey diagram relating majors in college to eventual careers.\n\nSoftware tools to draw Sankey diagrams are available on the web and for a variety of computing platforms.\n\nNotably Microsoft Visio - a common business infographics application - does not have \"Sankey Diagrams templates that ship with Visio\" \n\n\n"}

In the Abhidhamma and Pali commentaries, the bojjhangas tend to refer to supramundane factors \"concurrent with\" enlightenment.\n\nAccording to one discourse in the Samyutta Nikaya entitled \"Bhikkhu Sutta\" (SN 46.5):\n\nDuring meditation, one may contemplate the seven Factors of Enlightenment as well as on their antithesis, the Five Hindrances (sensual pleasure, ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, doubt). In addition, one Samyutta Nikaya sutta identifies developing each of the enlightenment factors accompanied by each of the four brahma viharas (lovingkindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity).\n\nIn the Samyutta Nikaya's \"Fire Discourse,\" the Buddha identifies that mindfulness is \"always useful\" (\"sabbatthika\"); while, when one's mind is sluggish, one should develop the enlightenment factors of investigation, energy and joy; and, when one's mind is excited, one should develop the enlightenment factors of tranquility, concentration and equanimity.\n\nAgain according to the Samyutta Nikaya, once when the Buddha was gravely ill he asked Venerable Mahacunda to recite the seven Factors of Enlightenment to him. In such a way the Buddha was cured of his illness.\n\nIn the Visuddhimagga, in a section discussing skills needed for the attainment and maintenance of absorption (\"jhana\"), Buddhaghosa identifies the bojjhangas in the following fashion:\n\nThe seven factors of awakening are closely related to the practice of \"dhyana\", resembling the various factors that are part of the four dhyanas.\n\nIn meditation everyone most likely experiences two of the five hindrances (Pāli: pañca nīvaraṇāni). They are sloth and torpor (Pāli: thīna-middha), which is half-hearted action with little or no collectedness, and restlessness and worry (uddhacca-kukkucca), which is the inability to calm the mind.\n\nAs indicated above, in the \"Fire Discourse\" (SN 46.53), it is recommended that joy or rapture, investigation, and energy are to be developed when experiencing sloth and torpor. Relaxation, concentration, and equanimity are to be developed when experiencing restlessness or worry. Mindfulness should be constantly present to remain aware of physical change as well as mental change in either skillful or unskillful direction.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56784437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56784437", "title": "Sexual harassment in the military", "text": "Sexual harassment in the military\n\nSexual harassment in the military is unwanted sexual behaviour, which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a military setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in civilian life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience sexual harassment in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military detainees.\n\nSexual harassment is unwanted sexual behaviour which is threatening or otherwise upsetting to others. Some example definitions in use by state armed forces are:\n\nSexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of pornographic material, may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and sexual assault. Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault.\n\nIn the British army, a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006:‘A friend was out on an exercise when a group of men ducked her head in a bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I could see she was upset.’In the Canadian armed forces, demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the \"Deschamps Review\" of 2015:'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, or to become a man”.'A woman in the French army, pseudonymised by the \"Independent\" newspaper as Captain Carole, was raped by her commanding officer:'It was months before I could pronounce the word \"rape\"... I blamed myself. I said: \"We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?\" But when that happens you are terrorised.'\n\nStudies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in military than civilian settings. Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions. Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on conformity, obedience, and hierarchical power relations, combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them. The traditionally masculine values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role.\n\nCanadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on military operations.\n\nWhile some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected. Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research.\n\nCadet forces are military youth organisations for younger teenagers based in communities and schools, and are common around the world. There is some evidence from the UK, where hundreds of complaints of the sexual abuse of cadets have been recorded since 2012, and from Canada, where one in ten complaints of sexual assault in the military are from cadets, that these institutions are susceptible to a culture of sexual harassment.\n\nIndividuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the Iraq War, for example, personnel of the US army and US Central Intelligence Agency committed a number of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison, including rape, sodomy, and other forms of sexual abuse. Another example is the detention of two Iraqi men on a British warship at the start of the Iraq War, when they were made to strip naked and were then sexually humiliated.\n\nAlthough the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents. For example:\n\nSince the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military, armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys.\n\nWomen affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer stress-related mental illness afterwards. Research in the US found that when sexual abuse of female military personnel is psychiatrically traumatic, the odds of suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.\n\nResearch in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue.\n\nThe military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example:\n\nWidespread reports of sexual harassment in the Australian armed forces led to the establishment of the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible.\n\nA Royal Commission into institutional child sexual abuse was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy. The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal gang rape, and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other. The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission.\n\nAccording to official statistics gathered by \"Maclean's\" magazine, the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases.\n\nIn 2014, the ombudsman of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'.\n\nIn 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the \"External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces\" (the \"Deschamps Review\"), was published. It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety. The \"Deschamps Review\" also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness. One male interview told the Review, for example: \"Girls that come to the Army know what to expect.\" It stated that senior NCOs are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint.\n\nThe following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 Canadian armed forces personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year).\n\nThe extent of sexual harassment in the French armed forces first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in \"La Guerre Invisible\", a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual. According to the \"Independent\" newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed.\n\nFollowing concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the Equality and Human Rights Commission) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces, a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence. Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all lesbians or sluts.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.' The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group. A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same.\n\nIn 2017, a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police. The Ministry of Defence paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets, and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016, of whom 6,172 made an official complaint. According to an article published in \"Medscape\", up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault.\n\n\n\n"}

The system of \"sosloviyes\" was a peculiar system of social groups in the history of the Russian Empire. In Russian language the terms \"сословие\" and \"состояние\" (in the meaning of the civil/legal estate) were used interchangeably.\n\nThe Code of the Law of the Russian Empire of 1832, vol. 9, \"Laws about Estates\" (Законы о состояниях) defined four major estates: dvoryans (nobility), clergy, urban dwellers and rural dwellers (peasants). Within these, more detailed categories were recognized:\n\nSee \"Russian nobility: Categories\" for dvoryans. \n\nClergy was subdivided into \"white\" (priests) and \"black\" (monks). \n\nUrban dwellers (Городские обыватели) were categorized into потомственные почетные граждане (hereditary distinguished citizens), личные почетные граждане(personal distinguished citizens), merchantry (), urban commoners (), and guilded craftspeople (цеховые ремесленники). \n\nThere also existed the military estate, which included lower military ranks (higher ranks were associated with the estate of dvoryans), and discharged and indefinite-leave. Dependent families were usually included into the estate of the head of the household.\n\nUrban commoners included people who had some real estate in a town, were engaged in some trade, craft, or service, and paid taxes. Subject to these conditions, a person could assign himself into this category, which was hereditary, and one may be excluded from it in the court of law or by the urban commoner's self-government (мещанская управа). \n\nThe category of rural dwellers (сельские обыватели) had permanent residence in towns, and they were correspondingly classified as \"urban peasants\" (городовые крестьяне). The rural dwellers category also included the \"inorodtsy\" (инородцы) estate, that included non-Russian and non-Orthodox native peoples of Siberia, Central Asia or Caucasus. An inorodets who converted into Orthodox Christianity was excluded from this estate and included into one of the other ones, most often peasantry.\n\nA separate category, not assigned to any of the above estates were \"raznochintsy\" (literally \"persons of miscellaneous ranks\", but in fact having no rank at all).\n\nA separate stratification existed for governmental bureaucracy, who were classified according to the Table of Ranks. The higher ranks belonged to the \"sosloviye\" of dvoryanstvo, while the indication of a lower rank of a person was comparable to that of the indication of a \"soslovie\" for various formal purposes (e.g., for the Russian Empire Census).\nFinally, in Siberia, the estate of \"exiled\" was officially recognized, with the subcategory of \"exiled nobility\". \n\nThe institution of distinguished citizenship (or two categories) was introduced by the manifesto of Nicholas I of Russia of April 10, 1832. The distinguished citizens ranked above merchantry and below nobility. They were freed of personal taxes, military service obligation (рекрутская повинность), corporal punishments, etc. Distinguished citizenship was available for persons with a scientific or scholar degree, graduates of certain schools, people of arts and destinguished merchants and industrialists subject to certain conditions.\n\nThe estates were classified into two major groups: taxable estates (податные сословия), i.e., which had to pay the personal tax, and non-taxable ones.\n\nWith the development of capitalism and the abolishment of the serfdom in Russia in the second half of the 19th century the estate paradigm no longer corresponded to the actual socio-economical stratification of the population, but the terminology was in use until the Russian Revolution of 1917. At the same time the legal and governmental system gradually became estate-independent, with the property grade (имущественный ценз) of a person playing the decisive role.\n\n"}
{"id": "7866648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7866648", "title": "Socio-analysis", "text": "Socio-analysis\n\nSocio-analysis is the activity of exploration, consultancy, and action research which combines and synthesises methodologies and theories derived from psychoanalysis, group relations, social systems thinking, organisational behaviour, and social dreaming.\n\nSocio-analysis offers a conception of individuals, groups, organisations, and global systems that takes into account conscious and unconscious aspects and potentialities. From this conception are born methods of exploration which can increase capacities through making conscious what was unconscious for individuals, groups, and organisations, and through releasing energy and ideas that help create individual and organizational direction, and meaning.\n\nSocio-analysis has at its heart a query as to what is the psychological truth for an individual, group, organisation, or other social system, and how may this best be brought to light as a means for creative transformation and growth?\n\nAnxiety, its exploration, and understanding are of central concern to psychoanalysis, which was founded to explore the mental problems of medical patients. While socio-analytic exploration frequently uncovers systemic pain, (of which anxiety is a part), the “pain” is a guide to transformation of the system as a whole with all its potentialities for growth. Joshua Bain has suggested that the emphasis on anxiety is limiting, and that a more appropriate paradigm for socio-analysis is wonder. Wonder was regarded by Plato as the beginning of philosophy, and its link to exploration, creativity, and the growth of capacities of human beings, would seem to make it the appropriate starting point for socio-analysis as well.\n\n“Wonder is the special affection of a philosopher; for philosophy has no other starting point than this; and it is a happy genealogy which makes Iris the daughter of Thaumas”. Theaetetus, 155D\n\nThe saying “When wonder ceases, knowledge begins”, which is attributed to\nSir Francis Bacon, is especially apt for socio-analysis with its emphasis on always explore, rather than sit tight on what is supposedly known.\n\nSocio-analysis has its roots in the first Northfield Experiment carried out by Wilfred Bion and John Rickman, and reported in the Lancet in 1943, and later by Bion in the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic in 1946. Bion is generally regarded as the father of socio-analysis (although the word was not used in those days).\n\nWilfred Bion was born in India in 1897 and educated at Bishop Stortford College in England. During the First World War he commanded a tank on the Western Front and was decorated for bravery: Distinguished Service Order, and the Legion of Honour. After studying History at Oxford University, and a stint teaching History at his old school, he began Medical training at University College Hospital in 1924 and qualified in 1930. He worked at the Tavistock Clinic in London before the Second World War, and started a personal psychoanalysis with John Rickman. After the Second World War he contributed to the formation of the Tavistock Institute. He had a second psycho-analysis with Melanie Klein, and trained and qualified as a psychoanalyst. Bion was, and is, regarded by many people as a genius who made fundamental contributions to psychoanalysis, and to the understanding of groups. His stance of always pointing to the unknown, whether with a patient or with a group or in himself, was the realization of his genius.\n\nNorthfield Hospital was a military hospital, situated in Birmingham, in the English Midlands, with the task of treating soldiers who had developed psychiatric problems, in order to get them back into the war. Together with John Rickman, Wilfred Bion introduced group meetings as the principal method of change for these patients. This Experiment, together with the Second Northfield Experiment associated with the innovations of S. H. Foulkes, Tom Main and Harold Bridger, contributed the following elements to the emerging discipline of socio-analysis:\n\nThe Northfield Experiments heralded a socio-analytic consultant role: one of exploration of individual, group, and organisational phenomena which are linked dynamically. The socio-analyst, as exemplified by the role Bion took at Northfield, and after the War in his group explorations at the Tavistock Clinic, works from a stance of “not knowing” with the courage, and fortitude, to pursue psychological truth.\n\nThe socio-analyst, like the psychoanalyst, uses concepts such as the unconscious, defences, splitting, projection, projective identification, introjection, and transference, but the field for exploration, while including the individual, is wider than the psychoanalytic dyad – e.g. a group, an organisation, a society, global systems.\n\nThus, for example, the socio-analyst uses concepts of group and organisational transference, and pays particular attention to the way he/she is made to feel through client engagements, as a possible indication of unconscious dynamics within the client system.\n\nBion’s exploration of group dynamics at the Tavistock Clinic in London after the war culminated in a seminal publication “Experiences in Groups”, which describes and analyses three basic assumptions that can be observed in group behaviour at different times: basic assumption dependency, basic assumption fight / flight, and basic assumption pairing. Basic assumptions operate unconsciously within groups at the same time a group may be engaged in a conscious work task – that Bion called a W group.\n\nThese insights of Bion together with theories of Kurt Lewin led to the first Group Relations Conference in 1957 that was sponsored by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations and Leicester University, and directed by Eric Trist.\nGroup Relations Conferences typically explore the effects of group and organisational dynamics on how individuals take up authority and leadership in this temporary institution, and in their work. The “Leicester” Conference as it came to be known under the leadership of A.K.Rice and colleagues such as Pierre Turquet, Eric Miller, Robert Gosling, and Bruce Reed stimulated similar explorations and enterprises in numerous countries: United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, France, Éire, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Bulgaria, Finland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Israel, India, and Australia.\n\nOther influences on the nascent discipline of socio-analysis that emerged from the work of social scientists at the Tavistock Institute in the 1950s were action research; the discovery of socio-technical systems by Eric Trist and Ken Bamforth, its development by Trist and Emery, Rice and Miller; and Elliott Jaques and Isabel Menzies's concept of social systems being structured as a defence against anxiety.\n\nA recent methodology for the exploration of social phenomena has been the discovery of social dreaming by Gordon Lawrence at the Tavistock Institute in 1982.\nSocial Dreaming is the activity of sharing dreams (night dreams), associations to the dreams, and connections between dreams, with others in a Matrix setting. The focus of social dreaming (unlike in psychoanalysis or dreaming groups) is not on the meaning of the dream for the individual dreamer, but regarding the dreams and associations as a way of exploring and making social meaning. Conferences to explore social dreaming have been held in Israel, the United States, Australia, India, and most European countries.\n\nUp until 1996 the work that has been described in this article went under different labels. There was no one word that described the activities and the role. Alastair Bain suggested that the discipline should be called “Socio-Analysis” in 1996.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis pioneered a three-year professional training program in socio-analysis in 1999, and began publishing a Journal “Socio-Analysis” in 1999. While the Australian Institute of Socio-Analysis no longer exists the work of socio-analysis continues to be developed by the Centre for Socio-Analysis in Melbourne . Other organisations which do socio-analytic or closely related work include the William Alanson White Institute in New York, the A.K. Rice Institute in the United States, the Tavistock Institute and Tavistock Clinic in London, the Grubb Institute and OPUS , both in London, the Centre for Applied Research in Philadelphia, the International Society for the Psychoanalytic Study of Organisations , the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the University of Wuppertal , and practitioners from many countries who work in the tradition of Wilfred Bion. The Journal “Socio-Analysis” is now published by Group Relations Australia.\n\nCurrent developments in socio-analysis include Bain’s discovery of Organisational Dreaming,\nwhich is based on the observation that dreams are “container sensitive”, and that the dreams shared by people within an organisation during a project will reflect organisational realities that are the “unexpressed known” within the organisation.\n\nThe work of the Centre for Socio-Analysis has also led to a formulation of “authority” that is based in wonder and the sangha (Buddhist notion of “people on the path”) in contrast to usual understandings that are based on the individual, anxiety, and hierarchy.\n\n\n"}

It is often considered to supersede the Weber–Fechner law, based on a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and sensation, because the power law describes a wider range of sensory comparisons.\n\nThe theory is named after psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens (1906–1973). Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th-century researchers, Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957.\n\nThe general form of the law is\nwhere \"I\" is the intensity or strength of the stimulus in physical units (energy, weight, pressure, mixture proportions, etc.), ψ(\"I\") is the magnitude of the sensation evoked by the stimulus, \"a\" is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation or sensory modality, and \"k\" is a proportionality constant that depends on the units used.\n\nA distinction has been made between local psychophysics, where stimuli can only be discriminated with a probability around 50%, and global psychophysics, where the stimuli can be discriminated correctly with near certainty (Luce & Krumhansl, 1988). The Weber–Fechner law and methods described by L. L. Thurstone are generally applied in local psychophysics, whereas Stevens's methods are usually applied in global psychophysics.\n\nThe table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens.\n\nThe principal methods used by Stevens to measure the perceived intensity of a stimulus were \"magnitude estimation\" and \"magnitude production\". In magnitude estimation with a standard, the experimenter presents a stimulus called a \"standard\" and assigns it a number called the \"modulus\". For subsequent stimuli, subjects report numerically their perceived intensity relative to the standard so as to preserve the ratio between the sensations and the numerical estimates (e.g., a sound perceived twice as loud as the standard should be given a number twice the modulus). In magnitude estimation without a standard (usually just \"magnitude estimation\"), subjects are free to choose their own standard, assigning any number to the first stimulus and all subsequent ones with the only requirement being that the ratio between sensations and numbers is preserved. In magnitude production a number and a reference stimulus is given and subjects produce a stimulus that is perceived as that number times the reference. Also used is \"cross-modality matching\", which generally involves subjects altering the magnitude of one physical quantity, such as the brightness of a light, so that its perceived intensity is equal to the perceived intensity of another type of quantity, such as warmth or pressure.\n\nStevens generally collected magnitude estimation data from multiple observers, averaged the data across subjects, and then fitted a power function to the data. Because the fit was generally reasonable, he concluded the power law was correct.\n\nA principal criticism has been that Stevens's approach provides neither a direct test of the power law itself nor the underlying assumptions of the magnitude estimation/production method: it simply fits curves to data points. In addition, the power law can be deduced mathematically from the Weber-Fechner logarithmic function (Mackay, 1963), and the relation makes predictions consistent with data (Staddon, 1978). As with all psychometric studies, Stevens's approach ignores individual differences in the stimulus-sensation relationship, and there are generally large individual differences in this relationship that averaging the data will obscure .\n\nStevens's main assertion was that using magnitude estimations/productions respondents were able to make judgements on a ratio scale (i.e., if \"x\" and \"y\" are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant \"k\" such that \"x\" = \"ky\"). In the context of axiomatic psychophysics, formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions \"p\" and \"q\", and three stimuli, \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", if \"y\" is judged \"p\" times \"x\", \"z\" is judged \"q\" times \"y\", then \"t\" = \"pq\" times \"x\" should be equal to \"z\". This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected (, ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if \"y\" is judged \"p\" times \"x\", \"z\" is judged \"q\" times \"y\", and if \"y\" is judged \"q\" times \"x\", \"z\" is judged \"p\" times \"y\", then \"z\" should equal \"z\". This property has been sustained in a variety of situations (, ).\n\nCritics of the power law also point out that the validity of the law is contingent on the measurement of perceived stimulus intensity that is employed in the relevant experiments. , under the condition that respondents' numerical distortion function and the psychophysical functions could be separated, formulated a behavioral condition equivalent to the psychophysical function being a power function. This condition was confirmed for just over half the respondents, and the power form was found to be a reasonable approximation for the rest .\n\nIt has also been questioned, particularly in terms of signal detection theory, whether any given stimulus is actually associated with a particular and \"absolute\" perceived intensity; i.e. one that is independent of contextual factors and conditions. Consistent with this, Luce (1990, p. 73) observed that \"by introducing contexts such as background noise in loudness judgements, the shape of the magnitude estimation functions certainly deviates sharply from a power function\". Indeed, nearly all sensory judgments can be changed by the context in which a stimulus is perceived.\n\n\n"}

Adhyāya means \"a lesson, lecture, chapter; reading\". Svā means \"own, one's own, self, the human soul\". Therefore, Svādhyāya literally means \"one's own reading, lesson\".\n\nSvādhyāya is also a compound Sanskrit word composed of svā (स्वा) + dhyāya (ध्याय). Dhyāya means \"meditating on\". The root of Adhyāya and Dhyāya is “Dhyai” (ध्यै) which means “meditate, contemplate, think of”. The term Svādhyāya therefore, also connotes “contemplation, meditation, reflection of one self”, or simply “to study one’s own self”.\n\nThe term \"Svadhyaya\" has other meanings. In the \"Smritis\", it refers to the historical practice of self-reciting Vedas to ensure it is memorized and faithfully transmitted, without writing, by the word of mouth, to the next generation. In various schools of Hinduism, particularly \"Yoga\", \"Svadhyaya\" is also a \"niyama\", a virtuous behavior. As a virtue, it means \"study of self\", \"self-reflection\", \"introspection, observation of self\".\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad’s hymn 1.9.1 emphasizes the central importance of \"Svadhyaya\" in one’s pursuit of Reality (Ṛta), Truth (Satya), Self-restraint (Damah), Perseverance (Tapas), Tranquility and Inner Peace (Samas), Relationships with others, family, guests (Praja, Prajana, Manush, Atithi) and all Rituals (Agnaya, Agnihotram).\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad, however, adds in verse 1.9.1, that along with the virtue of ' process of learning, one must teach and share (\"pravacana\") what one learns. This is expressed by the phrase \"'\", translated as \"and learning and teaching\" by Gambhīrānanda\n\nIn verse 1.11.1, the final chapter in the education of a student, the Taittiriya Upanishad reminds,\nOne of the earliest mention of Svādhyāya is found in Taittiriya Aranyaka 2.15: \"\" (\"svādhyāya must be practiced\"). Śatpath Brāhmana also repeats it. Chandogya Upanishad verse 4.16.1-2 recommends both silent (\"mānas\") and vocal (\"vāchika\") types of svādhyāya.\n\nPatanjali's \"Yogasutra\", in verse II.44, recommends \"Svadhyaya\" as follows\n\nVishnu Smriti's verse 22.92, states that \"human body is cleansed by water, the mind is cleansed by truth, the soul by self-study and meditation, while understanding is cleansed by knowledge\".\n\nVasistha Dharmasastra verses 27.1 through 27.7 states that \"Svadhyaya\" helps an individual understand and overcome his past. Apastamba Dharmasutra 1.4.12.1 states \"Svadhyaya\" is a form of \"Tapas\". This view is shared by Baudhayana Dharmasastra in verses 4.1.29 to 4.1.30, which adds that ‘‘svadhyaya is a means of getting past one’s past mistakes and any guilt”. Baudhayana Dharmasastra describes ‘‘Svadhyaya’’, in verse 2.6.11, as the path to Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Spirit, Eternal Self).\n\nAs a tool for memorization, ' had a unique meaning for Vedic scholars as the principal tool for the oral preservation of the Vedas in their original form for millennia. When used as a formal part of scriptural study, ' involves repeated recitations of scripture for purposes of mastering the mantras with their accurate pronunciation.\n\nThe Vedas had not been committed to writing in ancient times. Almost all printed editions depend on the late manuscripts that are hardly older than 500 years, not on the still-extant and superior oral tradition. Monier Monier-Williams defines \"śruti\" as \"sacred knowledge orally transmitted by the from generation to generations, the Veda\". Michael Witzel explains this oral tradition as follows:\nThe Vedic texts were orally composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from teacher to student that was formalized early on. This ensured an impeccable textual transmission superior to the classical texts of other cultures; it is, in fact, something like a \"tape-recording\"... Not just the actual words, but even the long-lost musical (tonal) accent (as in old Greek or in Japanese) has been preserved up to the present.\"\nThe commentator Sāyana discusses this term in the introduction of his commentary on the ', in which he says that ' enables Vedic rituals (yājnika karmakānda) to take place.\n\nMadhva, the dualistic Vaishnava philosopher, defined philosophy as the three-stage process of understanding ('), reflection ('), and application ('), expressing itself in two forms: study (') and teaching (\"). Of these two, Madhva considered teaching to be the highest aspect of discipline leading to . Mādhavāchārya's views on svādhyāya are to be found in chapter 15 of Sarva-Darśana-Sangraha (cf. references).\n\nThe \"Taittirīya Upanishad\", which belongs to the \"Yajur Veda\", is still popular among those who learn Vedic chanting. Recitation of mantras (Japa) is an integral part of Bhakti Yoga, and in this tradition of Hinduism, it is sometimes called \"Japa Yoga\".\n\nThere are certain days on which ' were prohibited, these were called ', after which \"\" must be resumed on the following day ; therefore the day of resumption is also called .\n\nSvādhyāya is one of the three key elements in the practice of yoga as defined in the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\", appearing in the opening verse of Book two on spiritual practice and elaborated upon in two other verses. Patanjali mentions a second time as one of the five recommended observances (\"niyamas\"), along with purity, contentment, austerity, and self-surrender. The five \"niyamas\", together with the five abstentions (\"yamas\"), have been described as \"'the ten commandments' of the .\"\n\nThe practice of Svadhyaya as a Niyama is perfected in many forms. One form of Svadhyaya is mantra meditation, where certain sound constructs pregnant with meaning are recited, anchoring the mind to one thought. This practice helps draw the mind away from outward-going tendencies, silencing the crowding of thoughts, and ultimately towards inward feeling of resonance. It can alternately be any music, sermon, chant, inspirational book that absorbs the person to a state of absorption, trance, unifying oneness.\n\nSvadhyaya is practiced as a self-reflection process, where one silently meditates, in Asana, on one’s own behaviors, motivations and plans. Svadhyaya is, in a sense, for one’s spirit and mind a process equivalent to watching one’s body in a non-distorting mirror. This self-study, in Yoga, is not merely contemplation of one’s own motives and behaviors, but also of one’s circumstances and the environment one is in, assessing where one is in one’s life, what is one’s life direction, if and how desirable changes may lead to a more fulfilling Self.\n\n"}
