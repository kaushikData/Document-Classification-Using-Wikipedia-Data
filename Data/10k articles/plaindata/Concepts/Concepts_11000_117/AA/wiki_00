The present-day division established for the German-speaking world (less Switzerland) was compiled by the German, Austrian and South Tyrol Alpine Clubs and published in 1984 and is also used for the basic numbering of Alpine Club maps for mountaineering.\n\nThe Eastern Alps are divided into four main areas: the Northern Limestone Alps, the Central Eastern Alps, the Southern Limestone Alps, and the Western Limestone Alps. These four main ranges are further divided into 75 sub-groups. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each, while the Southern Limestone Alps have 15. The six groups of the Western Limestone Alps are also classed with the Central Eastern Alps.\n\nThe classification is based principally on orographic considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The amendments of 1984 address a number of geological problems and have dropped many of the 1924 Morrigl groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. The Western Limestone Alps were added, an area which is not covered by the three Alpine Clubs and actually is a continuation of the Southern and Swiss Alps. Unlike the previous scheme, the Salzburg Slate Alps were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps as they are part of the greywacke zone that forms the basement of the Limestone Alps. The Ortler Alps and the Sobretta-Gavia range were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, though geologically, they are north of the Periadriatic Seam and ranked part of the Austroalpine nappes.\n\nThe Eastern Alps extend across six European countries: Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group.\n\nThe only four-thousander and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the Piz Bernina at . Thus the Bernina Range is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the Ortler Alps, whose highest peak, Mt. Ortler at , is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the Glockner Group with the highest mountain in Austria: the Grossglockner at . Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the Lechtal Alps, whose highest summit is the Parseierspitze at . 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres—except for the Vienna Woods, whose highest mountain, the Schöpfl, just reaches an altitude of .\n\nSee List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps\n\nUp to today, there is no internationally accepted classification of the Alps. Beside the common AVE arrangement, the Swiss Alpine Club subdivides the Swiss Alps (including the East Alpine parts) along cantonal boundaries, while Austrian hydrography uses a slightly different orographic system. In Italy and France the segmentation is usually based on the 1926 \"Partizione delle Alpi\". In 2005, a new proposal was made by the Italian Alpinist, Sergio Marazzi, to merge the competing systems of the Alpine states into the \"Suddivisione Orografica Internazionale Unificata del Sistema Alpino\" (SOIUSA), but this has not gained acceptance.\n\n"}

{"id": "2022070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2022070", "title": "Ayyavazhi", "text": "Ayyavazhi\n\nAyyavazhi (, \"Ayyāvaḻi\" , \"Path of the Master\") is a universalizing henotheistic belief that originated in South India. It is cited as an independent monistic religion by several newspapers, government reports, journals, and academic researchers. In Indian censuses, however, the majority of its followers declare themselves as Hindus. Therefore, Ayyavazhi is also considered a Hindu denomination.\n\nAyyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of Ayya Vaikundar; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts \"Akilathirattu Ammanai\" and \"Arul Nool\". Accordingly, Vaikundar was the Purna avatar of Narayana. Ayyavazhi shares many ideas with Hinduism in its beliefs and practice, but differs considerably in its concepts of good and evil and dharma. Ayyavazhi is classified as a dharmic belief because of its central focus on dharma.\n\nAyyavazhi first came to public attention in the 19th century as a Hindu sect. Vaikundar's activities and the growing number of followers caused a reformation and revolution in 19th century Travancorean and Tamil society, surprising the feudal social system of South India. It also triggered a number of reform movements including those of Narayana Guru and Ramalinga Swamigal etc.\n\nThough Ayyavazhi followers are spread across India, they are primarily present in South India, especially concentrated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The number of practitioners is estimated to be between 8,000,000 and 10,000,000 although the exact number is unknown, since Ayyavazhis are reported as Hindus during censuses.\n\n\"Ayya\" in Tamil means 'Master' and \"vazhi\", 'way'; the simple translation is \"Master's way\" or 'Father's way' Due to the diverse synonymous versions for the phrase in Tamil, it also leads to various other theories.\n\nAyyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar (known historically as \"Mudisoodum Perumal\") (c. 1809 – c. 1851 CE) at Poovandanthoppe. The Thuvayal thavasu (washing penance) of 1840 is the origin of Ayyavazhi as an alternative religio-cultural phenomena. The majority of its participants were from marginalised and poor sections of society. They began to function as a distinct and autonomous society, and gradually, they identified their path with the phrase 'Ayya vazhi'. Although the majority of these followers were from the Nadar caste, a large number of people from other castes also follow it. Ayyavazhi's rapid growth throughout its first century of existence was noted by Christian missionary reports from the mid-19th century.\n\nBy the middle of 19th century, Ayyavazhi had come to be a recognisable religious phenomenon with deep roots in the regions of South Travancore and South Tirunelveli. The numbers of faithful increased significantly from the 1840s. By the close of the 19th century, Swamithope was considered the religio-cultural epi-center of Ayyavazhi. After the time of Vaikundar, Ayyavazhi was spread through his teachings. The five Seedars, disciples of Vaikundar and their descendants, traveled to several parts of the country bearing the mission of Ayyavazhi. Meanwhile, the Payyan dynasty started administrating the Swamithoppe pathi, while other Pathis came under the administration of the followers of Ayya. Following the instructions of Akilattirattu Ammanai (Akilam), the Nizhal Thangals (small pagodas) have been established across the country for worship and the study of scripture.\n\nArul Nool, the first Ayyavazhi work in print was released in 1927, followed by the Akilam in 1933, almost a century after it had been written down. As a result, Ayyavazhi abandoned active oral traditions in favor of literary scriptures. Ayyavazhi headquarter reports that Ayyavazhi spread more rapidly after Indian Independence (1940s) and still more rapidly through the 1990s. Many Ayyavazhi-based social welfare organisations were established in the late 20th century. Several alternative versions of Akilam, including some controversial versions, were released during the same period. The Anbukkodimakkal Thirucchabai, a democratic bureau, was established by the religious headquarters in the early 1990s to organize and govern the religion. Organisational conferences are held in various cities in South India including Mumbai, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nConsidering the growth of Ayyavazhi, Ayya Vaikunda Avataram, the day of Vaikundar's incarnation, was declared a holiday by the state administration for the district of Kanyakumari in 1994, followed by the districts of Tirunelveli and Tuticorin in 2006. From 2012 C.E Vaikunda Avataram was declared a restricted holiday for the entire Tamil Nadu state. and for the Kerala State from 2015. Currently, Bala Prajapathi Adikalar, heir to the Payyan dynasty, is considered the leader of Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe holy books of Ayyavazhi are the Akilattirattu Ammanai (commonly referred to as \"<nowiki>Akilam</nowiki>\") and the Arul Nool, and they are the source of the religion's mythology. The \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\" was written by Hari Gopalan Seedar in 1841, as if hearing the contents of Akilam told by Narayana to his consort Lakshmi. In addition to the mythological events Akilam also provides an extensive quantity of historical facts, especially that of mid and late 2nd millennium CE. While the original text is damaged, the daughter versions such as the \"Swamithope\" version, the \"Kottangadu\" version as well as the \"Panchalankurichi\" versions, are the earliest existing palm-leaf versions of Akilam. Other released versions includes the Sentrathisai Ventraperumal, the Vivekanandan, the highly criticised VTV and the earliest and commonly accepted Palaramachandran version. Akilam contains more than 15,000 verses in seventeen sections. It is written in poetic Tamil in a ballad form, and is composed with a unique literal-style with two subgenres, \"Viruttam\" and \"Natai\" throughout.\n\nThe secondary scripture, Arul Nool, includes various books that are believed to be written by Arulalarkal (one possessed by divine power). It contains prayers, hymns and instructions for the way of worship in Ayyavazhi, as well as rituals prophesy and many acts. It also contains many events found in the Akilam pertaining to the life of Vaikundar. Unlike Akilam, there is no definitive history for Arul Nool. All these texts are compiled in Tamil language.\n\nTo the Ayyavazhi devotees, there are seven holy places, called Pathis, with the Pancha pathis being the most important. The temple of the Swamithope pathi is the headquarters of the Ayyavazhi.\n\nThe five Pancha pathi are:\n1. the Swamithope Pathi, the venue of the great Tavam and the religion's headquarters.\n2. Ambala Pathi, where Vaikundar joined six of the Seven Deities unto himself.\n3. Mutta Pathi, the venue of the Second and Third Vinchais.\n4. Thamaraikulam Pathi, where the Akilattirattu Ammanai was written down.\n5. Poo Pathi, where Ayya unified the Earth goddess Poomadanthai to himself by symbolic marriage.\n\nVakaippathi, though not included in the Pancha pathis by the headquarters, is still considered as a Pathi but with lesser importance. There is disagreement among followers of Ayyavazhi regarding the holiness of some other Pathis, such as Vaikunda Pathi and Avathara Pathi. The list of Pathis announced by the headquarters of Ayyavazhi does not include these Pathis.\n\nThe symbol of Ayyavazhi is a lotus carrying a flame-shaped white \"Namam\". The lotus represents the 1,008-petalled \"Sahasrara\" (in Tamil, \"Ladam\"), while the Namam represents the \"Aanma Jyothi\" or \"atman\". Both of the Ayyavazhi scriptures refer to Thirunamam (the \"flame shaped symbol\" present in the top of the Lotus in the Ayyavazhi symbol), but not to the lotus directly. The symbol is the ideological summary of Akilam-based philosophy. This symbol has been in use since the mid-20th century.\n\nThe mythical narration in akilam about the eight yugas is often viewed philosophically as a reference to eight chakras. The first, Neetiya Yukam, is Bindu and the final state, Dharma Yukam, is Sahasrara, or absolute bliss. In this series, the energy of consciousness (\"namam\") of oneself is invoked, rising from Bindu (Neetiya Yukam) to the final Sahasrara (Dharma Yukam). This lotus, the highest spiritual center of enlightenment, is for experiencing the absolute \"bliss\". The reigning power in the final Dharma Yukam (Sahasrara) is Ekam, which is a part of Vaikundar a Trinity conception, or a manifestation of the supreme absolute. Thus Ayyavazhi's symbol is derived from Akilam. The symbol \"Lotus with Thirunamam\" shows \"Vaikundar's experienced in Sahasrara.\"\n\nIn certain Hindu texts, the Sahasrara chakra has 1000 petals. But in Ayyavazhi symbolism, Saharara has 1008 petals. In Ayyavazhi, there is no scriptural authority indicating the importance of 1000, but the number 1008 is commonly mentioned. Also, the incarnation year of Vaikundar is 1008 M.E. (Malayalam Era). Backing these scriptural identities, the 1008-petal lotus is followed in Ayyavazhi symbolism. \"Sahasrara\" is symbolised as a lotus without a stem.\n\nAyyavazhi architecture was developed in constructing Nizhal Thangals, where the inverted lotus flower of \"Sahasrara\" is used to cover the roof. The lotus may also represent the heart and the flame shape (Thirunamam), the divinity.\nAyyavazhi has used other symbols including Vaishnavite ' \"Triple Namam\" '(not used currently), and Conch.\n\nThe majority of Ayyavazhi's key teachings can be found in the book \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\" and other teachings are collated from various books written by unknown authors, whose works feature in the Arul Nool. Like Dharma, the other teachings of Ayyavazhi are twofold, sociological and mystical. The mystical teachings are devoted to revealing divine knowledge, while social teachings are primarily concerned with eliminating inequality and discrimination in society. The teachings encourage a positive relationship with God, as opposed to one based on fear. Followers are encouraged to refer to God as \"Ayya\", \"dear father\", to strengthen their intimacy and affection towards God.\n\nAyyavazhi mystics focus on supreme oneness. Among its variations, the theology always maintains this focus on oneness. The evil of Kali blocks the ultimate or supreme oneness prevailing between individual souls and the universe, creating among them a false sense of individuality and of extreme pride. This erroneous view causes the apparent sense of separation from the oneness and motivates against it. Ekam —the \"over-soul\" or the supreme soul—is identified as the whole of existence, changeless in nature and ubiquity. This is \"one which undergoes different changes with respect to space and time\" because of the evil force maya.\n\nAll of creation evolved from this Ekam, the supreme consciousness. All the qualities of Ekam are within each soul, and evolve from it. Each and every individual soul is a reflection or mirror of the absolute Supreme, Ekam, which provides the textual basis and metaphor for the mirror's role in Ayyavazhi worship. Human and all other souls are restricted and limited by the evil of Kali. This is why individual souls are not able to attain supreme bliss, and so are secondary to Ekam. Once a soul overcomes the influence of maya, it becomes one with Ekam. Its individuality is gone, and thereby it is Ekam. On the other hand, this supreme consciousness is personified as Paramatma (over-soul) by which, God is the \"Husband\", while all other souls are his \"consorts\", symbolised by Thirukkalyana Ekanai, where Vaikundar marries the individual souls. Also, the Ayyavazhi philosophy applies a common formula for the creation of human beings and the rest of the universe. Thus whatever exists externally to human beings exists also internally.\n\nAyyavazhi clearly and explicitly condemns the caste based inequalities in its social teachings. It heavily criticises the caste discrimination rather than the 'Caste system' itself.\nFrom its inception, Ayyavazhi has also served as an engine of social reform, particularly in the area of Travancore, which was previously noted for its unusually strong caste system. In this contest, the mingling of castes in Ayyavazhi centers was a vital element in the transformation of society.\n\nAyya Vaikundar was the first to succeed as a social reformer in launching political struggle, social renaissance as well as religious reformation in the country. Vaikundar was the pioneer of the social revolutionaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Research scholars regard Vaikundar as a teacher, healer and also a miracle worker. He was also said to be the forerunner of all social reformers of India. Akilam displayed sympathy for the laboring classes, and opposed to the often excessive taxes they were forced to pay. From the beginning the followers, fortified by the teachings, have also taken a strong stand against political oppression. This is most clearly seen in Akilam, where the Thiruvithkanur king is identified as Kalineesan, (one who is a captive of Kali) and the British are identified as Venneesan (the white neesan) in the social sense. Ayyavazhi was in the forefront of movements for Human Rights and Social Equality. Ayyavazhi also effected many social changes in southern India, resulting in the emergence of a series of social and self-respect movements such as \"Upper cloth agitation\", Temple entry agitation and other movements including those of Narayana Guru, Chattampi Swamikal, Vallalar and Ayyankali.\n\nThe followers of Ayyavazhi established \"Pathis\" and \"Nizhal Thangals\", which are centers of worship and religious learning in various parts of the country. They serve as centres for propagation of the beliefs and practices of Ayyavazhi. There are thousands of \"Nizhal Thangals\" throughout India, mostly in South India. There more than 7000 worship centres in South India mainly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Reports from the London Missionary Society (LMS) of the mid-19th century also speak of \"Nizhal Thangals\". Since Ayyavazhi is not centrally organised, \"Swamithope pathi\" serves as the religious headquarters for all. The \"Pathi\"s earn more importance among the worship centers.\n\nThe seven \"Pathi\"s, obtain their significance from the fact that Vaikundar and his activities were historically associated with these centers of worship. The \"Swamithope pathi\", though considered the religion's headquarters, does not officially control the rest of the religious centers. All \"Pathis\", except itself, are managed by independent committees. The five \"Pathis\" known as Pancha pathi are considered foremost among Pathis.\n\nNizhal Thangals, compared with \"Pathis\", are simple small structures built for worship and for learning the teachings of Vaikundar. They also served as centers of school education during the early days. Food and shelter are offered to the needy in these centres. Some of them were established when Vaikundar was alive. Among them Arul Nool, specifies seven Thangals, and these are considered primary over the others. Today, charity is one of the main activities conducted in these centers.\n\nThese centers emerged as the abode of Dharma. The Nizhal Thangals form an important institution in the socio-religious life of the people of Ayyavazhi. Panividai may be conducted up to three times daily, but all worship centers provide Panividai at least once daily.\n\nThe ethics of Ayyavazhi, integrated with the meta-narrative mythology, are found throughout the primary scripture, \"Akilattirattu Ammanai\". Regarding ethics, Arul Nool is an accumulation of the core concepts found in Akilam. In Akilam, the ethical abstracts are pointed out as \"told by God\" at several places at different situations to lesser god-heads, devas, saints, etc. when ever asked by them.\n\nNeetham is the primary virtue of Ayyavazhi. This shows how society, its people, the ruling king, etc., lived in absolute harmony with nature, placing the power of Almighty in all their works, deeds and activities during early ages. In return, nature and the divine beings protect the society which follows the Neetham. Chastity and life in ultimate union with nature form the central theme, an ethical form that is to be followed. As in Akilam, Vinchai is the rules and regulations provided by God (Narayana) to Vaikundar. There are three such Vinchais. Acts found there also fit to humans to improve their moral code. The first \"Vinchai of Tiruchendur\" forms the largest ethical accumulation found in Akilam.\n\nTo an extent, the Dharmic teachings in Ayyavazhi are also considered as ethics. Charity in social ethics and \"attempting to realise the ultimate truth of oneness\" in spirituality are the ethical codes under the banner of Ayyavazhi dharma. Akilam also gives separate ethics for Devas also. It is notable that the Ayyavazhi ethics undergo a vast deviation from the incarnation of Vaikundar since a universal change took place then. Over all, as the foremost ethical code, people are advocated to overcome the evil force kalimayai with the weapons of love, forbearance and peace, since Kaliyan as maya rules the minds of people.\n\nArul Nool constitutes the major role in forming the rules and regulations of Ayyavazhi, including ethics. It gives separately the social as well as divine ethics. The Sivakanda Athikara Pathiram here is the section especially dedicated to teach the ethics. The rituals, especially circumambulations, are to be followed to wash-out the sin committed related to immoral thinking.\n\nIt is difficult to give a clear-cut listing to Ayyavazhi concepts because of the relation the Ayyavazhi scriptures maintains with the Hindu scriptures. Akilam primarily says the central themes of the existing scriptures (that of Hindu) had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar. It also narrates that Akilam was given to mankind as an alternative because Kaliyan destroyed the original Vedas and Shastras, and at the beginning of Kali Yuga, several additions were given to the previous scriptures by him. Both of these view points give the views of Akilam on Hindu scriptures, and place them as reasons for rejecting them.\n\nThe philosophy, terms and mythology of the Ayyavazhi scriptures are the basis of religious study on Ayyavazhi theology. But several terms quoted in Akilam couldn't be understood wholly unless by referring to the descriptive details of those terms in Hindu scriptures. For example, if the 96 tatvas are understood, then the Kaliyan is understood. Therefore, theologians and philosophers today turn to Hindu scriptures to further their understanding of the tatvas as properties of the human body, which are not elaborated upon in Akilam. However, to understand Akilam and its philosophy, one should have a basic knowledge over the Hindu ideas and concepts. Since Akilam have no different view in this matter from Hindu scriptures, it was left to be gathered from there.\n\nOn mythical studies, Akilam covers almost the entire main mythology of Hinduism, including Mahabharata, Ramayana, Kantha Purana and Vishnu Purana, but with limited details. It includes only the main events that are directly linked to the main-stream story flow. But to undergo a detailed study on each, the appropriate Hindu scriptures that include those events in detail need to be referred. Akilam provides all these collectively in brief with an overall story line, which make it unique. Many philosophical concepts from Hinduism are found in Akilam; some of them are completely accepted, some are regenerated, while others are rejected.\n\nGenerally it was considered that once a particular concept is not found well-described in Ayyavazhi scriptures, such as Akilattirattu Ammanai or Arul Nool (as detail as in Hindu scriptures), and instead simply was quoted, then that particular conception is accepted as in Hindu scriptures for religious studies. But once Akilam has different views over something from that of the existing (Hindu) scriptures, then it would be found deeply described in Akilam itself and hence no need for referring other scriptures.\n\nThe theology of Ayyavazhi differs considerably from other monistic religions. It speaks of Ekam, the Oneness from which all that exists formed, and also an ultimate oneness that exists behind all differences. The Ekam, which is articulated as the supreme divine power itself, is supposed to remain unaffected by maya deep inside every changeable matter as an absolute constant. In theological terms, God is, in the highest sense, formless, infinite, genderless and beyond time and space. The term Ekam in Tamil language give simply the meanings, \"one\", \"absolute\", \"the whole which exists\" and \"the incomparable\"; all give some sort of direct monistic definition about God from Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nNarrating through mythology, The \"Sivam\" and the \"Sakthi\" are the first to get evolved from Ekam. The \"Natham\"(voice), Trimurthi, other lesser gods and the entire universe further evolved. The Trimurthi are greater among the personified Devas. Siva, one among the Trimurthi, was the supreme power until Kali Yuga. Vishnu is the supreme from the advent of Kali Yuga. Then, from the incarnation of Vaikundar, again the powers of all god-heads, including that of Vishnu, is transformed to Vaikundar. Ekam, the supreme oneness as one among the Trinity takes a place within Vaikundar for the present age. Therefore, Vaikundar is said to be the only worshippable and supreme power. However, a quote from Akilam thirteen says this supreme oneness (Ekam) itself is created by Vaikundar, who is a personified God. In this regard, Ayyavazhi being centered on Vaikundar, is more monotheistic rather than monistic. No other god-heads, even the Father of Vaikundar, Narayana, have gained an equal or greater status than Vaikundar. Vaikundar is a turine power who includes the qualities of the Santror, Narayana and Ekam within himself.\n\nIn Ayyavazhi mythology, Kroni, a primordial evil manifestation, was fragmented into six and each fragment took birth and plays an anti-Vishnu role throughout the successive six yugas. He was finally destroyed by a final judgment which is followed by the god-ruled Dharma Yukam. This narration gives some dualistic dimension to Ayyavazhi theology. But since the focus of Arul Nool, the accumulation of Ayyavazhi teachings is extremely monistic and since the final fragment of Kroni itself is called \"Kalimayai\" (a conception rather than a physical or material incarnation), it was commonly accepted that the 'Maya' is symbolised in such a way that contrasts the dualistic view on Ayyavazhi. Apart from all these, there are also separate quotes in Ayyavazhi scriptures which give pantheistic and panentheistic definition to Ayyavazhi theology.\n\nThere are two yearly festivals for Ayyavazhi. The Ayya Vaikunda Avataram is celebrated on the twentieth day of the Tamil month \"Masi\" (March – April). This is the only Ayyavazhi festival to be celebrated as per the Solar calendar. The mass procession conducted on this day from Nagercoil to Swamithoppe is a popular one in this part of the country. The Thiru Edu-Vasippu is a festival of seventeen days celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November–December). This celebration of textual reciting as a festival itself is a unique feature to Ayyavazhi. Apart from this, there is a tri-yearly celebration of Kodiyettru Thirunal in Swamithope. Another unique feature is the celebration of every day as a festival in Swamithope,(exclusive to Swamithope) called as \" 'Nitham Thirunal' \".\n\nIn addition to the philosophical concepts and mythology, the rituals of Ayyavazhi evolved in their own way. Most of the rituals have different operational and historical meanings. Historically, the rituals were used or viewed as an attempt to break the caste-based inequalities prevailed in the society of the time, and to strengthen and uplift the sociologically downtrodden and ill-treated. Examples of this include the charity on food as \" 'Anna Dharmam' \", physical as well as spiritual cleanliness through Thuvayal Thavasu, eliminating untouchability through Thottunamam, self-respect and courage through headgear, and unifying various castes through Muthirikkinaru.\n\nBut they too reveal, however, high philosophical ideas preached in a ritual language. The Muthirikkinaru and Thirunamam are treated religiously as if the \"Patham\" and \"Namam\" of them have the power to heal all sorts of mental as well as physical illness. Thuvayal thavasu is suggested as a training to reach the ultimate aim of Dharma Yukam. The use of the crown reveals that \"all are kings\", visualising an ideology similar to \"advaita\". Also, Ayyavazhi scriptures succeeded very much in helping to understand these philosophical ideas to the common mass which is very much unusual. The individual rituals, the ecstatic religiosity and the ritual healing, which are the features of Ayyavazhi worship, contributed to the formation of an idea of emancipation and a social discourse. Rituals attempt to uplift and treat the disenfranchised. Another important thing to be noted is the alternative phrases religiously used in Ayyavazhi universe different from Hinduism, to represent certain practices.\n\nThe formula of inclusiveness and exclusivity, as applied in the religio-cultural universe of Ayyavazhi, is unique because both the theories are mixed up in Ayyavazhi scriptures. The inclusive theory accepts the views of different religions for a certain period of time, and from then onwards exclusively rejects all of them in its narrative.\n\nAyyavazhi accepts different god-heads of several religions, like the concept of Allah and almost all the god-heads of Hinduism. It also says that the one and the same God incarnates in different parts of the world at different time for rescuing the people from sufferings. But due to the advent of Kaliyan and because of the cruel nature of his boons, for the first time, the supreme power Ekam incarnates in the world as Vaikundar, and so all the lesser god-heads and previous scriptures had lost their substances. So after the time of the Vaikunda Avatar, Vaikundar was said to be the only worshippable God and hence, the theology of Ayyavazhi was channeled towards exclusivism. The manner in which Akilam treats the scriptures of different religions is complicated. For instance, while there is no direct reference to the terms 'Christ' or 'Bible' anywhere in any of the Ayyavazhi texts, there is an indirect reference in Akilam thirteen which is supposed to be an implication that Christ was an incarnation of Narayana, but it was widely thought that it did not recognise the Bible composition. It seems the view of Akilam on Bible is \"it was created with the intention of man and not that of God\". In common, creation of religions and shaping individualities for them are heavily criticised. The concepts 'God' and 'Religion' are kept poles apart in Akilam, and it seems to maintain an ideology something like \" 'Accept God; Reject religion' \".\n\nAyyavazhi accepts various incarnations in Hinduism, but necessarily rejects the so-called ' \"Hindu\" ' scriptures. It initially accepts Vedas. Later since Kaliyan had bought the Vedas as boon they too lost their substance by the advent of Kaliyan, and so had gone invalid. It also says that he (Kaliyan) had performed several additions and had hidden some of their content. And hence God incarnated as Vaikundar. So for the present age, Akilam is said to be the only \" 'Book of Perfection' \". By this Ayyavazhi rejects all other scriptures and follows only its own. Akilam highly condemns the creation of religions especially exclusivistic religious and theological ideas. It shows them as the foremost \"Kali mayai\" (evil of Kali). The scriptures teach sensibly and symbolically that God and his activities are beyond the reach of religions. It also preaches about universal oneness.\n\nThe mythology of Ayyavazhi narrates that the essence of this vision is an account of a history – a past, a present and a future – meant by weaving together of empirical facts, historical events as well as mythical accounts. It moves around three axiomatic typologies, namely Santror, Kali Yukam and Dharma Yukam, placing their base on the concepts and events of previous yugas that are associated also with Hindu mythology. The basic concepts give a symbolic vision which is at once religious and social.\n\nIt is closely linked to that of Hinduism. Akilam talks about the previous yugas and the evolution of Kroni through them. Events, mythical characters, and concepts are shared with Hinduism, though they may be engendered in different form. The number of Yugas and Avatars differs in Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. The personification of the entity of Evil for the current yuga, Kaliyan, is unique to Ayyavazhi. Akilam says that the true concepts were destroyed, so that all previous scriptures had lost their substances due to the advent of Kali.\n\nThe book also speaks of God incarnating in the world in the Kali Yukam (the present age) to destroy the evil spirit, the final and the most serious manifestation of Kroni. God incarnates as Vaikundar, and since Vaikundar lived recently, he was well known in history. So in the second part of the mythology many mythical as well as historical facts were woven together. Most of the events such as Muthirikkinaru, Wearing of Headgear during worship, Thuvayal Thavasu all were noted in history.\n\nThough there are quotes in Arul Nool to accredit the ten Avatars of Vishnu, it seems that they are not seen in equal status with these incarnations (as in the table). It was considered secondary to the primary avatars, who are associated with the destructions of the fragments of Kroni. This view is not inconsistent with Hinduism, as only Narasimha, Rama and Krishna are considered the primary avatars who are still worshipped. The other avatars are considered secondary avatars who are not worshipped.\n\nThe Santror is the subject of the religious vision of Ayyavazhi. There is both a religious and a social category in its connotation. In the social sense, it is believed that the term Santror fits rightly to the early \"Chanars\", who were called by the Arabs as \"Al Hind\", and known in biblical times as the \"People of Five Rivers\"; they are now scattered with more than 250 branches throughout the world. But in turn, in ideological sense and from the literary meaning of the term \"Santror\" in Tamil, it represents one who is noble and lives with dignity and supreme knowledge, giving an inclusive character and universal reach. Historians account that in ancient dravidian cultures, zealous devotees of God were called as 'Chanars'. A quote from Akilam too reads, \"Chanars (Santror) are those who have the ability to see 'the invisible' constantly.\"\n\nThe Santror are given a historical background in Ayyavazhi mythology as seven boys who were made to be born in the mythical garden Ayodha Amirtha Vanam \"(supposed to be between present-day Srirangam, Tamil Nadu and Triconamalee, Sri Lanka)\" by using the seven seeds from seven upper worlds, by Thirumal, to the seven virgins. Theologians interpret that these 'Seven boys' refer to the ancestors of the whole human race, and hence the term \"Santror\" refers to the entire human race. Their lineage started at the end phase of Dvapara Yukam and continued through the Kali Yukam into the Dharma Yukam. It is believed that Kali is being destroyed continuously by the activities of the Santror in the Path of Vaikundar, and so the Dharma Yukam unfolds eventually. In this sense they have a considerable roll in the destruction of Kali, the foremost evil.\n\nThe Ayyavazhi proposes an emancipatory utopia under the banner of Dharma Yukam. The basis of the belief is that Ayya Vaikundar had come to establish and rule as the everlasting king over the Dharma Yukam in the place of Kali Yukam after sentencing Kroni to hell by a final judgment from the Lion-throne of \"Dwaraka pathi\", the rising mythical landmass (which was sunken at the end of Dwapara Yuga by Krishna) located south east of present-day Kanyakumari. The Dharma Yukam is narrated as beyond the limits of time and space. It is often related to Moksha—the personal liberation, and to the state of 'Oneness' too.\n\nThe Hindu and Ayyavazhi ideologies are closely tied to each other. The place where Ayyavazhi and Hinduism depart from each other is at the advent of Kali Yuga. Akilam says that until the advent of Kali Yuga, the Vedas and all other Hindu scriptures remained with Divinity. Each of the gods referred to in the scriptures (Hindu) also remained with all their powers. But from the beginning of Kali Yuga, they and all their virtues collapsed. Kaliyan was a part of the mundane primordial manifestation who spread maya or illusion upon the existing scriptures and Devas. In Kali Yuga, all true scriptures are bound to maya and are unhelpful.\n\nThe reason, as stated in Akilam for the disintegration of the entire system is that, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, there in Mount Kailash, Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds. So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan. So Siva and Brahma surrendered all their powers to Vishnu. Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to Shaivism, where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power. Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of Kali Yuga until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.\n\nDuring the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had bought as boon the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A total universal transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by Lakshmi and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.\n\nAnd from now onwards all the powers were handled over from Vishnu to Vaikundar inside the sea. Siva, Vishnu and Brahma therefore form a part within Vaikundar. This ideology about Trimurthi (three are equal in power) is similar to that of Smartism. Vishnu alone forms a double role; one, within Vaikundar, and the other, as the father of him, remain inside the sea and regulating Vaikundar through Vinchais. After Vaikundar was given birth to, by assuming the Power of Ekam, Vaikundar was supreme to Vishnu and all other God-heads, though Vishnu playing the role of Father to Vaikundar. However, Vaikundar had to obey the order of Vishnu, since Vaikundar was given birth to perform the duties of Vishnu, which he (Vishnu) could not do. Vaikundar (and scriptures given by him) is the manifestation of the supreme Ekam so, in Ayyavazhi spirituality, he is the only worshippable universal power\n\nRegarding scriptures, the first part of Akilam is summed-up events of the previous yugas, which are present in Hindu scriptures. The second part says about the universal transformation and the uniqueness of Vaikundar and his incarnational activities. So as a summary, till the beginning of Kali yuga, what is Hinduism, that is Ayyavazhi. From then onwards for a series of reasons, Akilam says that 'Hindu' scriptures and its ideology had lost its purity and was destroyed, and so the Dharma was re-configured in the name of Akilam and Vaikundar and the 'Hindu' ideas were re-formed.\n\n\"Akilam\" points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology. But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called \"Narayana Swami Pathi\" or \"Narayana Swami Temple\", similar to Hindu Vaishnavism. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as Kali, Hanuman and other folk deities in spite of the anti-polytheistic ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture.\n\nSome followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten Avatars of Vishnu as Kalki, while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the Trinity conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power. The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today. Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides \"panividais\" for other lesser gods too.\n\nThe spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of Shamanism. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead). The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the Palliyarai. Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. Not even the Payyans from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly. All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated as a separate belief and instead taken as a Hindu sect.\n\nThere is a common belief that Ayya Vaikundar is a prophet and he had made many prophecies during his earthly years. On the contrary, there are no implications in Akilam or other books of Arul Nool that Vaikundar himself foretold anything, except in Thiruvasagam 4, Akilam:12. The common mis-understanding is because, the Akilam and Arul Nool includes hundreds of Prophecies and the contents of both the books is being divinely revealed to the Seedars by Vaikundar and the Seedars brought them to the written form. So, instead of the prophecies in both the books being considered that of Seedars it is mis-understood that the prophecies is of Vaikundar. Robert Caldwell, one among the very few historians of the contemporary period (who's views are always overwhelmingly negative on Vaikundar, since himself being a LMS Christian missionary), too referred to the then belief that seedars (disciples) profess to foretell events.\n\nAyyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The rituals are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning. Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to Shastras, Agamas, Vedas and Puranas. But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar, from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a \"Hindu renaissance\". Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too, as it brought many social changes there in the Tamil and keralite society during the 19th century.\n\nThe religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as \"Path of God\" with the phrase \"Ayya Vazhi\". On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that Vaikundar unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar. Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate theology, mythology, holy places, worship centres, and ethics of its own. \nThough many new papers, academic researchers and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion. They indulge in the mystic practices of possessions and divinations similar to the tribal religions of Tamil Nadu. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.\n\nRegarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across India, comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu, it is very hard to find a village without a worship centre of Ayyavazhi. Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers) there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered Hindus in the census.\n\n\n"}

On complex manifolds, they are fundamental and serve as the basis for much of algebraic geometry, Kähler geometry, and Hodge theory. Over non-complex manifolds, they also play a role in the study of almost complex structures, the theory of spinors, and CR structures.\n\nTypically, complex forms are considered because of some desirable decomposition that the forms admit. On a complex manifold, for instance, any complex \"k\"-form can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of so-called (\"p\",\"q\")-forms: roughly, wedges of \"p\" differentials of the holomorphic coordinates with \"q\" differentials of their complex conjugates. The ensemble of (\"p\",\"q\")-forms becomes the primitive object of study, and determines a finer geometrical structure on the manifold than the \"k\"-forms. Even finer structures exist, for example, in cases where Hodge theory applies.\n\nSuppose that \"M\" is a complex manifold. Then there is a local coordinate system consisting of \"n\" complex-valued functions \"z\"...,z such that the coordinate transitions from one patch to another are holomorphic functions of these variables. The space of complex forms carries a rich structure, depending fundamentally on the fact that these transition functions are holomorphic, rather than just smooth.\n\nWe begin with the case of one-forms. First decompose the complex coordinates into their real and imaginary parts: \"z\"=\"x\"+\"iy\" for each \"j\". Letting\none sees that any differential form with complex coefficients can be written uniquely as a sum\n\nLet Ω be the space of complex differential forms containing only formula_3's and Ω be the space of forms containing only formula_4's. One can show, by the Cauchy–Riemann equations, that the spaces Ω and Ω are stable under holomorphic coordinate changes. In other words, if one makes a different choice \"w\" of holomorphic coordinate system, then elements of Ω transform tensorially, as do elements of Ω. Thus the spaces Ω and Ω determine complex vector bundles on the complex manifold.\n\nThe wedge product of complex differential forms is defined in the same way as with real forms. Let \"p\" and \"q\" be a pair of non-negative integers ≤ \"n\". The space Ω of (\"p\",\"q\")-forms is defined by taking linear combinations of the wedge products of \"p\" elements from Ω and \"q\" elements from Ω. Symbolically,\nwhere there are \"p\" factors of Ω and \"q\" factors of Ω. Just as with the two spaces of 1-forms, these are stable under holomorphic changes of coordinates, and so determine vector bundles.\n\nIf \"E\" is the space of all complex differential forms of total degree \"k\", then each element of \"E\" can be expressed in a unique way as a linear combination of elements from among the spaces Ω with \"p\"+\"q\"=\"k\". More succinctly, there is a direct sum decomposition\nBecause this direct sum decomposition is stable under holomorphic coordinate changes, it also determines a vector bundle decomposition.\n\nIn particular, for each \"k\" and each \"p\" and \"q\" with \"p\"+\"q\"=\"k\", there is a canonical projection of vector bundles\n\nThe usual exterior derivative defines a mapping of sections formula_8 via\nThe exterior derivative does not in itself reflect the more rigid complex structure of the manifold.\n\nUsing \"d\" and the projections defined in the previous subsection, it is possible to define the Dolbeault operators:\nTo describe these operators in local coordinates, let\n\nThe following properties are seen to hold:\n\nThese operators and their properties form the basis for Dolbeault cohomology and many aspects of Hodge theory.\n\nFor each \"p\", a holomorphic \"p\"-form is a holomorphic section of the bundle Ω.

{"id": "7363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7363", "title": "Complexity", "text": "Complexity\n\nComplexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.\n\nThe term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory.\n\nScience takes a number of approaches to characterizing complexity; Zayed \"et al.\"\nreflect many of these. Neil Johnson states that \"even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples...\" Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of \"complexity science\" as \"the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects\".\n\nDefinitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a confidential \"system\" – a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.\n\nWarren Weaver posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.\nPhenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront \"dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole\". Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.\n\nThe approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.\n\nSome definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.\n\nOne of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.\n\nWeaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between \"disorganized complexity\" and \"organized complexity\".\n\nIn Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a \"disorganized complexity\" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.\n\nA prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) simplicity of planetary orbits – the latter can be predicted by applying Newton's laws of motion. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern chaos theory.\n\nOrganized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity vis-a-vis to other systems than the subject system can be said to \"emerge,\" without any \"guiding hand\".\n\nThe number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through modeling and simulation, particularly modeling and simulation with computers. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.\n\nThere are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.\n\nThe source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.\n\nIn the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. Robert Ulanowicz's treatment of ecosystems.\n\nComplexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape Turing machines are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. Random Access Machines allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.\n\nIn several scientific fields, \"complexity\" has a precise meaning:\n\n\nOther fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:\n\n\nComplexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex – displaying variation without being random – is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.\n\nThe use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting \"stovepipes\" and effective \"integrated\" solutions. This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.\n\nWhile this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations from different fields to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in anthills, human brains, or stock markets, social systems. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is relational order theories.\n\nThe behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and self-organization. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.\n\nRecent developments around artificial life, evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and complex adaptive systems.\n\nIn social science, the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in sociology. The topic is commonly recognized as social complexity that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e.: computational sociology.\n\nSystems theory has long been concerned with the study of complex systems (in recent times, \"complexity theory\" and \"complex systems\" have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety disciplines, including biology, economics, social studies and technology. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real world socio-cognitive systems and emerging systemics research. Complex systems tend to be high-dimensional, non-linear, and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.\n\nIn information theory, algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.\n\nComplex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the codec used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command \"X\" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like \"18995316\"), any two Turing-complete languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the \"translation\" language – which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.\n\nThese algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to random noise. However, those studying complex systems would not consider randomness as complexity.\n\nInformation entropy is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity.\n\nRecent work in machine learning has examined the complexity of the data as it affects the performance of supervised classification algorithms. Ho and Basu present a set of complexity measures for binary classification problems.\n\nThe complexity measures broadly cover:\nInstance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (or, in other words, which instances are the most complex). The characteristics of the instances that are likely to be misclassified are then measured based on the output from a set of hardness measures. The hardness measures are based on several supervised learning techniques such as measuring the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features. The information provided by the complexity measures has been examined for use in meta learning to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial and could be expanded to other areas.\n\nA recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes molecular recognition as a phenomenon of organisation.\nEven for small molecules like carbohydrates, the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual hydrogen bond's strength is exactly known.\n\nComputational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems – that is, the difficulty of solving them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm – usually a computer program – to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the travelling salesman problem, for example. It can be solved in time formula_1 (where \"n\" is the size of the network to visit – the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.\n\nEven though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. Computational complexity may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.\n\nThere exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called intractable.\n\nThere is another form of complexity called hierarchical complexity. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.\n\n"}

Scientific research has established that the mind and consciousness are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the brain, the cessation of which defines brain death. However, many believe in some form of life after death, which is a feature of many religions.\n\nNeuroscience is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the premise that all of behavior and all of the cognitive processes that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the nervous system, especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.\n\nThere are multiple lines of evidence that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.\n\n\nDeath is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).\n\nA near-death experience (NDE) is a personal experience associated with impending death, encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a hallucinatory state caused by various neurological factors such as cerebral anoxia, hypercarbia, abnormal activity in the temporal lobes and brain damage.\n\n"}

{"id": "3009184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3009184", "title": "Discernment", "text": "Discernment\n\nDiscernment is the ability to obtain sharp perceptions or to judge well (or the activity of so doing). In the case of judgment, discernment can be psychological or moral in nature. Within judgment, discernment \ninvolves going past the mere perception of something and making nuanced judgments about its properties or qualities. Considered as a virtue, a discerning individual is considered to possess wisdom, and be of good judgement; especially so with regard to subject matter often overlooked by others.\n\nIn Christianity, the word may have several meanings. Discernment can describe the process of determining God's desire in a situation or for one's life or identifying the true nature of a thing, such as discerning whether a thing is good or evil. In large part, it describes the interior search for an answer to the question of one's vocation, namely, determining whether or not God is calling one to the married life, single life, consecrated life, ordained ministry or any other calling.\n\nDiscernment of Spirits is a term used in both Roman Catholic and Charismatic (Evangelist) Christian theology to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence. \n\nThe process of individual discernment has required tasks in order for good discernment. These tasks include taking time in making the decision, using both the head and heart, and assessing important values. Time is necessary to make a good choice, decisions made in a hurry are often not the best decisions. When time is available to assess the situation it improves the discernment process. When time allots the tentative decision can be revisited days later to make sure that the individual is satisfied with their choice after the discernment process. Making decisions with the head means to first reflect on the situation and emphasize the rational aspect of the decision making process. In order to make a decision that is ours it also requires the heart in which the individual makes based on feelings as well as rationality. Values in the discernment process are weighing options that decide what is most important to the individual. Every individuals value system is different which effects each individual discernment process. Combining values, using both the head and heart and taking sufficient time when making decision are the main steps for a successful discernment process.\n\nGroup discernment is a separate branch of discernment. In group discernment each individual must first undergo their own discernment process. The individual must keep in mind what is best for the group as a whole as well as the individual when making a decision. The same principles of values, using the head and heart, as well as giving the decision making process ample time all still apply in group discernment. Group discernment is different because it requires multiple people to have a unanimous decision in order to move forward forward. Group discernment requires discussion and persuasion between individuals to arrive at a decision.\n\nChristian spiritual discernment can be separated from other types of discernment because every decision is to be made in accordance with God's will. The fundamental definition for Christian discernment is a decision making process in which an individual makes a discovery that can lead to future action. In the process of Christian spiritual discernment God guides the individual to help them arrive at the best decision. The way to arrive at the best decision in Christian spiritual discernment is to seek out internal external signs of God's action and then apply them to the decision at hand. Christian Discernment also has an emphasis on Jesus, and making decisions that align with those of Jesus within the New Testament. The focus on God and Jesus when making decisions is what separates Christian discernment from secular discernment. Ignatius of Loyola is often regarded as the master of the discernment of spirits. Ignatian discernment comes from Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556) when he created his own unique way of Catholic discernment. Ignatian discernment uses a series of Spiritual Exercises for discerning life choices and focuses on noticing God in all aspects of life. The Spiritual Exercises are designed to help people who are facing a major life decision. There are seven steps of discernment to be followed that include identifying the issue, taking time to pray about the choice, making a wholehearted decision, discussing the choice with a mentor and then finally trusting the decision made. While Ignatius was a religious man his discernment process can be applied to anyone independent of religion.\n"}

This methodology is used to simulate linear continuous systems, hybrid continuous and discrete-event systems, and any other system that involves the rate-based movement or flow of material from one location to another.\n\nIndustrial areas where DRS is used include: bulk material handling (e.g. minerals and ores, powders, particles, mixed wastes, wood chips), liquids and gases, pulp, oil and gas pipelines, traffic, and high speed/volume production lines in the food & beverage, consumer products, and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nDRS combines the event-based timing of discrete-event simulation(DES) and the continuous variables calculations found in continuous simulation. It predicts and schedules events when the system needs to calculate a new set of rates and determines the appropriate rate of flow for each branch or stream.\nDRS is similar to DES in that both methodologies model the operation of the system as a discrete sequence of events in time. However, while DES assumes there is no change in the system between consecutive events, in a DRS model the flow continues to move at a constant rate such that, for example, the level in a tank could change. Another difference is that DES models are overwhelmingly concerned with the status of system entities (discrete objects moving through the system) while DRS models are concerned with the status (quantity and location) of homogeneous flow. For rate-based systems, DRS has faster computational times and is more accurate in calculating mass balance compared to DES.\n\nDRS is also similar to continuous simulation in that it simulates homogeneous flow. In addition, both methods recalculate flow rates, which are continuous variables, whenever a state change occurs. However, DRS differs from continuous simulation in that it is event-based and does not simulate every time slice. Modeling linear flow systems using continuous simulation has limitations because it usually is unable to detect important events, such as a tank becoming full or empty, until after the event has occurred plus requires many more system recalculations during the course of the simulation.\n\nAn exercise in learning how to build discrete-rate simulations is to model a tank filling and emptying over time. The tank fills at a constant rate and empties at two different rates, one rate until it is full and a faster rate until it is empty. There are 4 types of events in the simulation: start simulation, storage full, storage empty, and end simulation. At each event the model determines which emptying rate to use; between events the emptying rate remains constant.\n"}

Langer studies the illusion of control, decision-making, aging, and mindfulness theory. Her most influential work is \"Counterclockwise\", published in 2009, which answers the questions of aging from her extensive research, and increased interest in the particulars of aging across the nation.\n\nLanger was born in The Bronx, New York. She received her bachelor's degree in Psychology from New York University, and her PhD in Social and Clinical Psychology from Yale University in 1974.\n\nLanger has had a significant influence on the positive psychology movement. Along with being known as the mother of positive psychology, her contributions to the study of mindfulness have earned her the moniker of the \"mother of mindfulness.\" Together her work has ushered in the movement of mind/body medicine which has been regarded by many scientist to be an important intellectual movement and one that now has \"considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment.\" She has published over 200 articles and academic texts, was published in \"The New York Times\", and discussed her works on \"Good Morning America\". Additionally, in many introductory psychology courses at universities across the United States, her studies are required reading.\n\nLanger and colleagues have conducted multiple forms of research to promote the flexibility of aging. Some of her most impactful work has been her pioneering research on her famous Counterclockwise Study (1979). This study was originally published by Oxford University Press and later described in her best seller, \"Mindfulness\". It is the basis of what is now called Reminiscence Therapy. The study was replicated in England, South Korea and the Netherlands and was the basis of a British Academy of Film and Television Awards nominated BBC series, The Young Ones. The study has also been mentioned in other media such as The Simpsons episode Havana Wild Weekend.\n\nOther important work has shown that rewarding behaviors and following completion of memory tasks improves memory. Another study showed that simply taking care of a plant improves mental and physical health, as well as life expectancy. These studies were the primitive steps to creating the Langer Mindfulness Scale. Her research provided for improved methods in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Additionally, in one of her most famous studies, Langer demonstrated the drastic benefits of mind/body unity theory. By having chambermaids call their everyday activity “exercise” rather than “labor,” Langer found that the chambermaids experienced a myriad of health benefits including: \"a decrease in their systolic blood pressure, weight, and waist-to-hip ratio — and a 10 percent drop in blood pressure.\" \n\nLanger is well known for her contributions to the study of mindfulness and of mindless behaviour, with these contributions having provided the basis for many studies focused on individual differences in unconscious behavior and decision making processes in humans. In 1989, she published \"Mindfulness\", her first book, and some have referred to her as the \"mother of mindfulness\". In an interview with Krista Tippett on the National Public Radio program \"On Being,\" broadcast on Sept. 13, 2015, Langer defined mindfulness as \"the simple act of noticing new things.\" \nThe Langer Mindfulness Scale is still used in modern research.\n\nIn 1980, she was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. Other honors include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest of the American Psychological Association, the Liberty Science Center Genius Award, the Distinguished Contributions of Basic Science to Applied Psychology award from the American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology, the James McKeen Cattel Award, and the Gordon Allport Intergroup Relations Prize.\n\nHer finding that taking care of a plant significantly improved health outcomes in nursing home patients was shown to be the result of a statistical error. In one of her famous \"counterclockwise\" studies, Langer claimed that when elderly men were temporarily placed in a setting that recreated their past, their health improved, and they even looked younger. However, this study was never published in a peer-reviewed journal.\nThe only publication of this finding is in a chapter of a book edited by Langer. \n\nIn a 2014 New York Times Magazine profile, Langer described the week-long paid adult counterclockwise retreats she was creating in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, aimed towards replicating the effects found in her New Hampshire study. According to the article, \"Langer makes no apologies for the paid retreats, nor for what will be their steep price.\" Langer was defiant when pressed on the ethics of her study:\n\"To my question of whether such a nakedly commercial venture will undermine her academic credibility, Langer rolled her eyes a bit. 'Look, I’m not 40 years old. I’ve paid my dues, and there’s nothing wrong with making this more widely available to people, since I deeply believe it.'\"\n\n"}
{"id": "243382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243382", "title": "Erlangen program", "text": "Erlangen program\n\nThe Erlangen program is a method of characterizing geometries based on group theory and projective geometry. It was published by Felix Klein in 1872 as \"Vergleichende Betrachtungen über neuere geometrische Forschungen.\" It is named after the University Erlangen-Nürnberg, where Klein worked.\n\nBy 1872, non-Euclidean geometries had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein's method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:\n\nLater, Élie Cartan generalized Klein's homogeneous model spaces to Cartan connections on certain principal bundles, which generalized Riemannian geometry.\n\nSince Euclid, geometry had meant the geometry of Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, Möbius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical \"physicists\" that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.\n\nWith every geometry, Klein associated an underlying group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is \"a priori\" meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).\n\nIn other words, the \"traditional spaces\" are homogeneous spaces; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language.\n\nIn today's language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as Lie groups: the classical groups. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language.\n\nFor example, the group of projective geometry in \"n\" real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of \"n\"-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree \"n\" with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.\n\nTo explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The Euclidean group is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi-direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations. (See Klein geometry for more details.)\n\nThe long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at congruence (geometry), for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of symmetry has become standard in physics.\n\nWhen topology is routinely described in terms of properties invariant under homeomorphism, one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not Lie groups – but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became transformation geometry, a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of Euclid, but is less easily converted into a logical system.\n\nIn his book \"Structuralism\" (1970) Jean Piaget says, \"In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like Bourbaki, the Erlangen Program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of structure.\"\n\nFor a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a motion of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the Poincaré half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry through a development based on hyperbolic motions. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the ultraparallel theorem by successive motions.\n\nQuite often, it appears there are two or more distinct geometries with isomorphic automorphism groups. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the \"abstract\" group, to the geometry.\n\nOne example: oriented (i.e., reflections not included) elliptic geometry (i.e., the surface of an \"n\"-sphere with opposite points identified) and oriented spherical geometry (the same non-Euclidean geometry, but with opposite points not identified) have isomorphic automorphism group, SO(\"n\"+1) for even \"n\". These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise.\n\nTo take another example, elliptic geometries with different radii of curvature have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General Riemannian geometry falls outside the boundaries of the program.\n\nComplex, dual and double (aka split-complex) numbers appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,R)/H for the group SL(2,R) and its subgroups H=A, N, K . The group SL(2,R) acts on these homogeneous spaces by linear fractional transformations and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen programme.\n\nSome further notable examples have come up in physics.\n\nFirstly, \"n\"-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, \"n\"-dimensional de Sitter space and (\"n\"−1)-dimensional inversive geometry all have isomorphic automorphism groups,\n\nthe orthochronous Lorentz group, for . But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are \"dual\" for some models.\n\nAgain, \"n\"-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and (\"n\"−1)-dimensional conformal space with \"Lorentzian\" signature (in contrast with conformal space with \"Euclidean\" signature, which is identical to inversive geometry, for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with \"dualities\" between both spaces. See AdS/CFT for more details.\n\nThe covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional twistor space.\n\nThe Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics.\n\nIn the seminal paper which introduced categories, Saunders Mac Lane and S. Eilenberg stated: \"This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Program, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings\"\n\nRelations of the Erlangen program with work of C. Ehresmann on groupoids in geometry is considered in the article below by Pradines.\n\nIn mathematical logic, the Erlangen Program also served as an inspiration for Alfred Tarski in his analysis of logical notions.\n\n\n\n"}

This depends upon periodic diagnostic evaluation based upon calendar dates, distance, or use. The intent is to accomplish diagnostic evaluations that indicate when maintenance is required to prevent inconvenience and safety issues that will occur when critical equipment failures occur during use.\n\nThe electronic revolution allowed inexpensive sensors and controls to be integrated into most equipment. This includes diagnostic indicators, fluid sensors, temperature sensors, ignition sensors, exhaust monitoring, voltage sensors, and similar monitoring equipment that indicates when maintenance is required. Sensor displays are often located in inaccessible locations that cannot be observed during normal operation. Labor-intensive periodic maintenance is often required to inspect indicators.\n\nSome organizations have eliminated most labor-intensive periodic maintenance and diagnostic down time by implementing designs that bring all sensor status to fault indicators located in close proximity to users.\n\nMaintenance requires three actions.\n\nFault discovery requires diagnostic maintenance, which requires system down time and labor costs.\n\nDown time and cost requirements associated with diagnostics are eliminated for every item that satisfies the following criteria.\n\nFault reporting is an optional feature that can be forwarded to remote displays using simple configuration setting in all modern computing equipment. The system level of reporting that is appropriate for Condition Based Maintenance are critical, alert, and emergency, which indicate software termination due to failure.

{"id": "8715435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8715435", "title": "Gates of horn and ivory", "text": "Gates of horn and ivory\n\nThe gates of horn and ivory are a literary image used to distinguish true dreams (corresponding to factual occurrences) from false. The phrase originated in the Greek language, in which the word for \"horn\" is similar to that for \"fulfil\" and the word for \"ivory\" is similar to that for \"deceive\". On the basis of that play on words, true dreams are spoken of as coming through the gates of horn, false dreams as coming through those of ivory.\n\nThe earliest appearance of the image is in the Odyssey, book 19, lines 560–569. There Penelope, who has had a dream that seems to signify that her husband Odysseus is about to return, expresses by a play on words her conviction that the dream is false. She says:\n\nArthur T. Murray, translator of the original Loeb Classical Library edition of the Odyssey, commented:\n\nHomer greatly influenced Greek literature as a whole. Plato refers to the two gates in his dialogue \"Charmides\":\nA reference to the Odyssean image also appears in the late (c. AD 400) epic poet Nonnus:\n\nVirgil borrowed the image of the two gates in lines 893–898 of Book 6 of his \"Aeneid\", describing that of horn as the passageway for true shadows and that of ivory as that through which the Manes in the underworld send false dreams up to the living. Through the latter gate Virgil makes his hero Aeneas, accompanied by the Cumaean Sibyl, return from his visit to the underworld, where he has met, among others, his dead father Anchises: \n\nTwo gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;\n<br>Of polish'd ivory this, that of transparent horn:\n<br>True visions thro' transparent horn arise;\n<br>Thro' polish'd ivory pass deluding lies.\n<br>Of various things discoursing as he pass'd,\n<br>Anchises hither bends his steps at last.\n<br>Then, thro' the gate of iv'ry, he dismiss'd\n<br>His valiant offspring and divining guest.\n\nWhy Virgil has Aeneas return through the ivory gate (whence pass deluding lies) and not through that of horn is uncertain. One theory is that it refers to the time of night at which he returned. Jorge Luis Borges accepted the view that, for Virgil, what we call reality is not in fact such; that Virgil may have considered the Platonic world of the archetypes to be the real world.\n\nAnother explanation is that Virgil is thus indicating that what he has recounted is not to be taken as literal fact. In John Wesley's last sermon, preached on 17 January 1791, he spoke of how uncertain even the best conjectures about the invisible world were without revelation: \"The most finished of all these accounts, is that of the great Roman poet. Where observe how warily he begins, with that apologetic preface, – Sit mihi fas audita loqui – 'May I be allowed to tell what I have heard'. And, in the conclusion, lest anyone should imagine he believed any of these accounts, he sends the relater of them out of hades by the ivory gate, through which, he had just informed us, that only dreams and shadows pass, – a very plain intimation, that all which has gone before, is to be looked upon as a dream!\"\n\nIn his \"Silvae\" V iii 285–290, a lament for his dead father, the poet Publius Papinius Statius, expresses the wish that his father may come to him from the abode of the dead in the form of a true dream, passing therefore through the gate of horn:\n\nThence mayst thou pass to where the better gate of horn o'ercomes the envious ivory, and in the semblance of a dream teach me what thou wert wont to teach.\n\nThe 15th century Latin poet Basinio of Parma, employed at the court of Sigismondo Malatesta in Rimini, wrote a panegyric epic poem for his prince (\"Hesperis\") modelled largely on the \"Aeneid\" and the Homeric epics, in which Sigismondo, as epic hero, undertakes a journey to the underworld in order to meet his deceased father Pandolfo Malatesta. Before that he passes the temple of Fama which has a bipartite gate, one half made of horn, one of ivory. On the ivory half not only Sigismondo's descent but also the ones by Hercules, Theseus, Ulysses and Aeneas are depicted.\n\n\"Having seen that, they turn towards the astounding temple of Fame, a temple enormous and imposing in size and shape, whose door on its left side is white from ivory steps with shining horn on the other half. Disturbing nightmares are conveyed by false rumour on the vain gates of ivory, while true dreams of horn are sent by trustworthy rumours. The gate of horn shows the Spaniards defeated on the Tyrrhenian shore [i.e. Sigismondo's victory over Alfonso's V. troops at Piombino in 1448]. On the ivory steps Sigismondo turns toward the sea, and is swimming after his ship is destroyed [on his way to the island where he is to undertake his trip to the underworld]. There Theseus and also Hercules made their way: there brave and victorious Ulysses went to the gloomy homes of the Cimmerians; there faithful Aeneas took to the Stygian lake Avernus.\" \nBasinio's Latin text is as follows:\n\nThe gates of horn and ivory appear in the following notable English written works:\n\n\n"}

During intermittent periods of time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. \n\nThe nature and length of this \"Golden Age\" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as 711–718, the Muslim conquest of Iberia. Others date it from 912, during the rule of Abd-ar-Rahman III. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the Caliphate of Cordoba ended; 1066, the date of the Granada massacre; 1090, when the Almoravids invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the Almohads invaded.\n\nHaving invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. Al-Andalus was a key center of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages, producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As Sefarad, al-Andalus was the \"capital\" of world Judaism. \n\nMaría Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, claims that \"tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society\". Menocal's 2003 book, \"The Ornament of the World\", argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to \"al-Andalus\", where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation and, sometimes, on synagogue construction.\n\nBernard Lewis takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a \"theological as well as a logical absurdity.\" However, also Lewis states:\n\nMark Cohen, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, in his \"Under Crescent and Cross\", calls the idealized interfaith utopia a \"myth\" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. This myth was met with the \"counter-myth\" of the \"neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history\" by Bat Yeor and others, which also \"cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality\".\n\nPrior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain. The Visigoths were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the Visigoths joined the Catholic Church, they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the Muslim Arab and mainly Berber conquerors in the 8th century.\n\nA period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. North African Jewish immigrants and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the Caliphate of Cordoba. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of Jewish Philosophy. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim Al-Andalus. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called Toledo School of Translators, as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat, and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi. During 'Abd al-Rahman's term of power, the scholar Moses ben Enoch was appointed rabbi of Córdoba, and as a consequence al-Andalus became the center of Talmudic study, and Córdoba the meeting-place of Jewish savants.\n\nThis was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As \"dhimmis\", or \"protected non-Muslims\", Jews in the Islamic world paid the jizya, which was administered separately from the zakat paid by Muslims. The jizya has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own legal system and social services. Monotheist religions of the people of the book were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.\n\nComparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, the Jews were far more integrated in the political and economic life of Islamic society, and usually faced far less violence from Muslims, though there were some instances of persecution in the Islamic world as well from the 11th century. The Islamic world classified Jews (and Christians) as \"dhimmi\" and allowed them to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.\n\nOther authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a \"myth\". Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the 1066 Granada massacre of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the Rhineland slightly later. The notable Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:\n\nWith the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms. The first major persecution was the 1066 Granada massacre, which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, crucified Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, \"more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day.\" This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.\nBeginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the Almoravids, a puritan Muslim sect from Morocco. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under Ali III, than under his father Yusuf ibn Tashfin). Among those who held the title of \"vizier\" or \"nasi\" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam, Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial, Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar, and Solomon ibn Farusal. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical Almohades.\n\nDuring the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of Toledo, which had been reconquered in 1085 by Christian forces.\n\nThe major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the Alhambra decree of 1492 and a similar decree by Portugal in 1496.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14615780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14615780", "title": "Ironic process theory", "text": "Ironic process theory\n\nIronic process theory, ironic rebound, or the white bear problem refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface. An example is how when someone is actively trying not to think of a white bear they may actually be more likely to imagine one.\n\"Try to pose for yourself this task: not to think of a polar bear, and you will see that the cursed thing will come to mind every minute.\"\nThe phenomenon was identified through thought suppression studies in experimental psychology. Social psychologist Daniel Wegner first studied ironic process theory in a laboratory setting in 1987. Ironic mental processes have been shown in a variety of situations, where they are usually created or worsened by stress. In extreme cases, ironic mental processes result in intrusive thoughts about doing something immoral or out of character, which can be troubling to the individual. These findings have since guided clinical practice. For example, they show why it would be unproductive to try to suppress anxiety-producing or depressing thoughts.\n\nAlthough in certain domains, such as memorization, it appears that ironic effects of attempting to remember vary with the level of mental control over mnemonic processing and may simply be due to ineffective mental strategies.\n\nIn certain scenarios, things and stuff are strongly interrelated. \n\n\"Intentional memory processes and their associated mnemonic strategies can be viewed as one form of mental control\", When we attempt to exert influence over our memories we engage in mental control in the form of mnemonics our faculties of memory\". because \"mental control occurs when people suppress a thought, concentrate on a sensation, inhibit an emotion, maintain a mood, stir up a desire, squelch a craving, or otherwise exert influence on their own mental states\".\n\nThe experience sampling or daily diary method is one way that psychologists attempt to scientifically measure thoughts. This involves \"interrupting people as they go about their daily lives and asking them to record the thoughts they are having right at that moment, in that place\", often by using \"clickers\".\n\nOne research team at Ohio State University tried to figure out how often people think about sex by using so-called \"clickers\", asking the 283 college students to click each time they thought about sex, food, or sleep (there were three groups of students). The study found that on average men had 19 thoughts about sex per day (the highest being 388 times per day) whereas women thought about sex ten times per day. Among the study's flaws were that the researchers had not taken ironic process theory into their experimental design—students \"were given a clicker by the researchers and asked to record when they thought about sex (or food or sleep). Imagine them walking away from the psychology department, holding the clicker in their hand, trying hard not to think about sex all the time, yet also trying hard to remember to press the clicker every time they did think about it.\"\n\nIronic process theory proposed two opposing mechanisms (a dual process theory). First, \"monitoring processes\" unconsciously and automatically monitor for occurrences of the unwanted thought, calling upon the second—\"conscious operating processes\"—if the thought occurs. This theory explains the effects of increased cognitive load by emphasizing that where there is cognitive effort, the monitoring process may supplant the conscious process, also suggesting that in order for thought suppression to be effective, a balance between the two processes must exist, with the cognitive demand not being so great as to let the monitoring process interrupt the conscious processes. A 2006 study found that individual differences may be able to account for differences.\n\nCognitive overload inhibits successful activation of operating processes. Such overload has been shown to occur experimentally, when individuals attempt to aggressively suppress intrusive thoughts by distracting themselves—either by focusing on different environmental objects, or thinking of anything but the thought in question. (Overload is also believed to occur in daily life as a result of mental pressures, anxieties, stresses, and so forth). The monitoring process, serving to alert the individual to an unwanted thought about to become salient and intrude on his or her consciousness, continues to find instances of the unwanted thought creating a state of hyper-accessibility unchecked by controlled cognitive processes. Research has also shown that individuals do have a capacity to successfully suppress thoughts by focusing on specifically prepared distractions or objects—a process in thought suppression experiments sometimes referred to as \"focused distraction\".\n\nSimilar ideas appear throughout popular culture and sayings, often with variations on animal and color, such as \"It's as hard as trying not to think of a pink rhinoceros.\"\n\nIronic process theory is also the basis for the mind game known as \"The Game\", which constitutes trying not to think about the Game.\n\nAt the end of the 1984 movie \"Ghostbusters\", the characters are asked to think of a form for the coming of Gozer. They instruct each other not to think of anything, which sees one of the team, Ray, thinking of what he considers to be an innocuous thought of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, who then terrorizes them.\n\nIn an episode of \"Buzz Lightyear of Star Command\", Mira uses Ironic Process Theory to outsmart the Emperor Zerg, who has stolen her mind reading powers.\n\nThe idea figures heavily into the episode \"White Bear\" of British television series \"Black Mirror\".\n\n"}

{"id": "6365190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6365190", "title": "Li (Confucianism)", "text": "Li (Confucianism)\n\nLi () is a classical Chinese word which is commonly used in Chinese philosophy, particularly within Confucianism. \"Li\" does not encompass a definitive object but rather a somewhat abstract idea and, as such, is translated in a number of different ways. Wing-tsit Chan explains that \"li\" originally meant \"a religious sacrifice,\" but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with Natural law.\"\n\nIn Chinese cosmology, human agency participates in the ordering of the universe by Li ('rites'). There are several Chinese definitions of a rite, one of the most common definitions is that it transforms the invisible to visible; through the performance of rites at appropriate occasions, humans make visible the underlying order. Performing the correct ritual focuses, links, orders, and moves the social, which is the human realm, in correspondence with the terrestrial and celestial realms to keep all three in harmony. This procedure has been described as centering, which used to be the duty of the Son of Tian, the emperor. But it was also done by all those who conducted state, ancestral, and life-cycle rites and, in another way, by Daoists who conducted the rites of local gods as a centering of the forces of exemplary history, of liturgical service, of the correct conduct of human relations, and of the arts of divination such as the earliest of all Chinese classics—the \"Book of Changes\" (\"Yi Jing\")—joining textual learning to bodily practices for health and the harmonized enhancement of circuits of energy (qi). \n\nThe rites of \"li\" are not rites in the Western conception of religious custom. Rather, \"li\" embodies the entire spectrum of interaction with humans, nature, and even material objects. Confucius includes in his discussions of \"li\" such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. Xunzi cites \"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring\" as vital parts of the fabric of \"li\".\n\nAmong the earliest historical discussions on \"li\" stands the 25th year of Zhao Gong () in the Zuo Zhuan.\n\n\"Li\" consists of the norms of proper social behavior as taught to others by fathers, village elders and government officials. The teachings of li promoted ideals such as filial piety, brotherliness, righteousness, good faith and loyalty. The influence of \"li\" guided public expectations, such as the loyalty to superiors and respect for elders in the community.\n\nContinuous with the emphasis on community, following \"li\" included the internalization of action, which both yields the comforting feeling of tradition and allows one to become \"more open to the panoply of sensations of the experience\" (Rosemont 2005). But it should also maintain a healthy practice of selflessness, both in the actions themselves and in the proper example which is set for one's brothers. Approaches in the community, as well as personal approaches together demonstrate how \"li\" pervades in all things, the broad and the detailed, the good and the bad, the form and the formlessness. This is the complete realization of \"li\".\n\nThe rituals and practices of \"li\" are dynamic in nature. \"Li\" practices have been revised and evaluated throughout time to reflect the emerging views and beliefs found in society. Although these practices may change, which happens very slowly over time, the fundamental ideals remain at the core of \"li\", which largely relate to social order.\n\nConfucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of \"li\". Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of human beings with learning Li as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on \"li\" and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.\n\nConfucius stressed the importance of the rites as fundamental to proper governmental leadership. In his sayings, Confucius regarded feudal lords in China that adopted the Chinese rites as being just rulers of the Central States. Contrarily, feudal lords that did not adopt these rites were considered uncivilized, not worthy of being considered Chinese or part of the Central States (Spring and Autumn Annals).\n\n\"Li\" should be practiced by all members of the society. \"Li\" also involves the superior treating the inferior with propriety and respect. As Confucius said \"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety (Li); ministers should serve their prince with loyalty\" (Analects, 3:19).\n\n\"Li\" is \"one term by which the [traditional Chinese] historiographers could name all the principles of conservatism they advanced in the speeches of their characters.\" \n\n"}
{"id": "355559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355559", "title": "Mobbing", "text": "Mobbing\n\nMobbing, as a sociological term, means bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a family, peer group, school, workplace, neighborhood, community, or online.\n\nWhen it occurs as emotional abuse in the workplace, such as ‘ganging up’ by co-workers, subordinates or superiors, to force someone out of the workplace through rumor, innuendo, intimidation, humiliation, discrediting, and isolation, it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general harassment.\n\nKonrad Lorenz, in his book entitled \"On Aggression\" (1966), first described mobbing among birds and animals, attributing it to instincts rooted in the Darwinian struggle to thrive (see animal mobbing behavior). In his view, most humans are subject to similar innate impulses but capable of bringing them under rational control. Lorenz's explanation for his choice of the English word Mobbing was omitted in the English translation by Marjorie Kerr Wilson. According to Kenneth Westhues, Lorenz chose the word mobbing because he remembered in the collective attack by birds, the old German term \"hassen auf\", which means \"to hate after\" or \"to put a hate on\" was applied and this emphasised \"the depth of antipathy with which the attack is made\" rather than the English word mobbing which emphasised the collective aspect of the attack. \n\nIn the 1970s, the Swedish physician applied Lorenz's conceptualization to the collective aggression of children against a targeted child.\n\nIn the 1980s, professor and practising psychologist Heinz Leymann applied the term to ganging up in the workplace. \n\nIn 2011, anthropologist Janice Harper published an essay in The Huffington Post suggesting that some of the anti-bully approaches effectively constitute a form of mobbing by using the label \"bully\" to dehumanize, encouraging people to shun and avoid people labeled bullies, and in some cases, sabotage their work or refuse to work with them, while almost always calling for their exclusion and termination from employment.\n\nJanice Harper followed her Huffington Post essay with a series of essays in both The Huffington Post and in her column, Beyond Bullying: Peacebuilding at Work, School and Home in Psychology Today that argued that mobbing is a form of group aggression innate to primates, and that those who engage in mobbing are not necessarily \"evil\" or \"psychopathic,\" but responding in a predictable and patterned manner when someone in a position of leadership or influence communicates to the group that someone must go. For that reason, she indicated that anyone can and will engage in mobbing, and that once mobbing gets underway, just as in the animal kingdom it will almost always continue and intensify as long as the target remains with the group. She subsequently published a book on the topic in which she explored animal behavior, organizational cultures and historical forms of group aggression, suggesting that mobbing is a form of group aggression on a continuum of structural violence with genocide as the most extreme form of mob aggression.\n\nBritish anti-bullying researchers Andrea Adams and Tim Field have used the expression \"workplace bullying\" instead of what Leymann called \"mobbing\" in a workplace context. They identify mobbing as a particular type of bullying that is not as apparent as most, defining it as \"an emotional assault. It begins when an individual becomes the target of disrespectful and harmful behavior. Through innuendo, rumors, and public discrediting, a hostile environment is created in which one individual gathers others to willingly, or unwillingly, participate in continuous malevolent actions to force a person out of the workplace.\"\n\nAdams and Field believe that mobbing is typically found in work environments that have poorly organised production or working methods and incapable or inattentive management and that mobbing victims are usually \"exceptional individuals who demonstrated intelligence, competence, creativity, integrity, accomplishment and dedication\".\n\nIn contrast, Janice Harper suggests that workplace mobbing is typically found in organizations where there is limited opportunity for employees to exit, whether through tenure systems or contracts that make it difficult to terminate an employee (such as universities or unionized organizations), and/or where finding comparable work in the same community makes it difficult for the employee to voluntarily leave (such as academic positions, religious institutions, or military). In these employments, efforts to eliminate the worker will intensify to push the worker out against his or her will through shunning, sabotage, false accusations and a series of investigations and poor reviews. Another form of employment where workers are mobbed are those that require the use of uniforms or other markers of group inclusion (law enforcement, fire fighting, military), organizations where a single gender has predominated, but the other gender is beginning to enter (STEM fields, fire fighting, military, nursing, teaching, and construction). Finally, she suggests that organizations where there are limited opportunities for advancement can be prone to mobbing because those who do advance are more likely to view challenges to their leadership as threats to their precarious positions. Harper further challenges the idea that workers are targeted for their exceptional competence. In some cases, she suggests, exceptional workers are mobbed because they are viewed as threatening to someone, but some workers who are mobbed are not necessarily good workers. Rather, Harper contends, some mobbing targets are outcasts or unproductive workers who cannot easily be terminated, and are thus treated inhumanely to push them out. While Harper emphasizes the cruelty and damaging consequences of mobbing, her organizational analysis focuses on the structural, rather than moral, nature of the organization. Moreover, she views the behavior itself, which she terms workplace aggression, as grounded in group psychology, rather than individual psychosis—even when the mobbing is initiated due to a leader's personal psychosis, the dynamics of group aggression will transform the leader's bullying into group mobbing—two vastly distinct psychological and social phenomena.\n\nShallcross, Ramsay and Barker consider workplace \"mobbing\" to be a generally unfamiliar term in some English speaking countries. Some researchers claim that mobbing is simply another name for bullying. Workplace mobbing can be considered as a \"virus\" or a \"cancer\" that spreads throughout the workplace via gossip, rumour and unfounded accusations. It is a deliberate attempt to force a person out of their workplace by humiliation, general harassment, emotional abuse and/or terror. Mobbing can be described as being \"ganged up on.\" Mobbing is executed by a leader (who can be a manager, a co-worker, or a subordinate). The leader then rallies others into a systematic and frequent \"mob-like\" behaviour toward the victim.\n\nMobbing as \"downward bullying\" by superiors is also known as \"bossing\", and \"upward bullying\" by colleagues as \"staffing\", in some European countries, for instance, in German-speaking regions.\n\nVictims of workplace mobbing frequently suffer from: adjustment disorders, somatic symptoms, psychological trauma (e.g., trauma tremors or sudden onset selective mutism), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depression.\n\nIn mobbing targets with PTSD, Leymann notes that the \"mental effects were fully comparable with PTSD from war or prison camp experiences.\" Some patients may develop alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders. Family relationships routinely suffer. Workplace targets and witnesses may even develop brief psychotic episodes occupational psychosis generally with paranoid symptoms. Leymann estimated that 15% of suicides in Sweden could be directly attributed to workplace mobbing.\n\nFollowing on from the work of Heinemann, Elliot identifies mobbing as a common phenomenon in the form of group bullying at school. It involves 'ganging up' on someone using tactics of rumor, innuendo, discrediting, isolating, intimidating, and above all, making it look as if the targeted person is responsible (victim blaming).\n\nKenneth Westhues' study of mobbing in academia found that vulnerability was increased by personal differences such as being a foreigner or of a different sex; by working in fields such as music or literature which have recently come under the sway of less objective and more post-modern scholarship; financial pressure; or having an aggressive superior. Other factors included envy, heresy and campus politics.\n\nSociologists and authors have created checklists and other tools to identify mobbing behaviour. Common approaches to assessing mobbing behavior is through quantifying frequency of mobbing behavior based off a given definition of the behavior or through quantifying what respondents believe encompasses mobbing behavior. These are referred to as \"self-labeling\" and \"behavior experience\" methods respectively.\n\nLimitations of some mobbing examination tools are:\n\nCommon Tools used to measure mobbing behavior are:\n\nThe Waterloo Anti-Mobbing Instruments (WAMI) created by Kenneth Westhues contains a 16 item checklist to identify the signs of mobbing.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, it has been suggested that mobbing behavior can be curtailed by acknowledging behaviors as mobbing behaviors and that such behaviors result in harm and/or negative consequences. Precise definitions of such traits are critical due to ambiguity of unacceptable and acceptable behaviors potentially leading to unintentional mobbing behavior. Attenuation of mobbing behavior can further be enhanced by developing policies that explicitly address specific behaviors that are culturally accepted to result in harm or negative affect. This provides a framework from which mobbing victims can respond to mobbing. Lack of such a framework may result in a situation where each instance of mobbing is treated on an individual basis with no recourse of prevention. It may also indicate that such behaviors are warranted and within the realm of acceptable behavior within an organization. Direct responses to grievances related to mobbing that are handled outside of a courtroom and training programs outlining antibully-countermeasures also demonstrate a reduction in mobbing behavior.\n\n"}
{"id": "21509720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21509720", "title": "Moral suasion", "text": "Moral suasion\n\nMoral suasion is an appeal to morality in order to influence or change behavior. A famous example is the attempt by William Lloyd Garrison and his American Anti-Slavery Society to end slavery in the United States by using moral suasion. In economics, moral suasion is more specifically defined as \"the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law.\" The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy. Moral suasion in this narrower sense is also sometimes known as jawboning.\n\nThere are two types of moral suasion:\n\nMoral suasion has been applied in many different fields. In early educational thought, it was often paired against corporal punishment as a means of achieving school discipline. Similarly, in parenting, writers from the 19th century through Benjamin Spock have advocated the use of moral suasion with children as an alternative to physical violence. In politics, moral suasion has frequently been employed by movements for social change, but its effectiveness has varied widely.\n\nIn the temperance movement of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain and North America, moral suasion was initially a key part of the strategy for reducing the prevalence of alcohol in society. As the movement began to face the limitations of this strategy in the late 19th century, its members turned to legal coercion, leading to the rise of prohibitionism.\n\nIn the American Civil Rights Movement of the twentieth century, moral suasion was one of three major prongs of the movement, the others being legal action and collective nonviolent protest. After initial victories, this nonviolent strategy began to struggle in the 1960s, and largely ended with the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr..\n\nMoral suasion has sometimes been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in Singapore in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.\n\nUsage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative externalities that they cause. Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax. Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low.\n\nA study of marine debris regulations in the United States from 1989 to 1993 revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected. The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour however is not strong unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policy makers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.\n\nAs a policy tool, impure moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers. This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished. Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.\n\nMoral suasion will be \"an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance\".\n\nThere are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen.\n\nEven when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs.\n\nAlthough neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion. Indeed, companies that have been \"persuaded\" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.\n\nThe Bank of Canada defines moral suasion in central banking as \"a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy\". It could also be defined more generally as \"a process whereby commercial banks co-operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions\".\n\nFormal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to \"refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank\". Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried though various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial finance institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters.\n\nThe oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive. Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends.\n\nMoral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as \"open mouth operations\" in the financial sector. The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank. For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations, influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.\n\nMoral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of \"democratic socialism\" has been in place for some time. Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.\n\nAlthough moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective.\n\nCentralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent. Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly.\n\nEffectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply.\n\nAs fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography .\n\nStudies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in advanced economies. It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.\n\nMoral suasion is rarely used in isolation. Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives.\n\nFirms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations. In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.\n\nGovernments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed. This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Paul Volcker, warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level, and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.\n\nMoral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success. The threat of additional, specific taxes was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely.\n\nCentral banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of \"appropriate\" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs. Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range.\n\nGovernments can choose to publish information in order to \"shame\" certain market participants into altering their behaviour. The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging \"excessive\" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices. The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.\n\nThe threat of a public option, i.e. direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced, can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market.\n\nLarge monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.\n\n"}

The sense \"moment\" is also common in the Brāhmanạs. In the Rigveda we only find the sense \"moment.\"\n\nFurther each muhūrta is further divided into 30 (Indian) minutes or kalā (making 30 Kalā ≈ 48 western min). Each kalā is further divided into 30 (Indian) seconds or Kāṣṭhā, making 30 Kāṣṭhā ≈ 1.6 western minute.\n\nThe \"Sandhi Vidchhed\" for the term is thus: It breaks muhūrt into two parts, \"muhu\" (moment/immediate) and \"ṛta\" (order). The author of Ṛg Ved III.33.5 has accordingly created this descriptive term. Ṛta refers to the natural, yearly order of the seasons, so that the term muhūrt refers to the daily reflection of these. Also, cf., \"Śatpath Brāhmaṇa\" X.4.2.18, as below.\n\nThe term appears as early as the Ṛg Veda, where, according to Monier Williams, it means \"a moment\", but does not evidence any specification of an exact periodicity there as received in later works, such as the \"Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa\", \"The One Hundred Path Riddle\" or the \"Taittirīya-Brāhmaṇa\", \"The Partridge's Riddle\".\n\nPt. Vijay Shrikrishna Jakatdar points to two specific Ṛg Veda passages that employ the term, III.33.5, and III.53.8:\n\nरमध्वं मे वचसे सोम्याय रतावरीरुप मुहूर्तमेवैः | \nपर सिन्धुमछा बर्हती मनीषावस्युरह्वे कुशिकस्य सूनुः ||\n\n\"Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a \"moment\" in your journey.\nWith hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto the River.\" (trans.

One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies. This is demonstrated in the way \"Muhūrt\" is used in present-day South Asia for calculating the most auspicious moment for a Vedic-Hindu Wedding ceremony. Astrologers are often hired to calculate a moment for the wedding so that any possible divinely-sourced problems can be averted. Jakatdar suggests a shift in the contemporary temperament regarding the traditional approach to calculating such events, to accommodate the ever increasing complexity of modern life. The muhūrt has the same utility in the marriage rites in Brahmanism. \n\nAnother example is the so-called Brahma Muhūrta, which is about one and a half hours before sunrise. This particular time, which is associated with the constellations during the Vernal Equinox, is said to be auspicious for practicing yoga. There is also the case of \"samayik\", which is part of the initiation rite for the \"Svetambar\" mendicants or those who pursue a perpetual state of heightened meditative awareness. They take the \"samayik,\" a vow for life taken for short periods, preferably one or two muhūrts, where one muhūrt constitutes forty minutes.\n\nThe Muhūrtas are traditionally calculated by assuming sunrise at 06:00 AM on the Vernal Equinox, which is the Vedic New Year. Not all of the constellations cross the zenith, so that it is not in every case clear which constellation presides over the Muhūrta. Yet it is clear that one or more prominent features of the correlate constellations, from which the later Muhūrtas draw their respective names, falls within the Celestial Longitude of the same, drawn from the Polar Axis.\n\nTraditionally, it is common practice amongst Hindus to start or avoid starting significant tasks like religious ceremonies, etc. on the basis of the quality of a particular Muhūrta. The Vedic scriptures also generally recommend one or more Muhūrtas to perform rituals and practices. The most widely known example of this practice:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1812213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812213", "title": "Nikolay Danilevsky", "text": "Nikolay Danilevsky\n\nNikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky (; 28 November 1822 – 7 November 1885) was a Russian Empire naturalist, economist, ethnologist, philosopher, historian and ideologue of Pan-Slavism and the Slavophile movement. He expounded a circular view of world history.\n\nHe is remembered also for his opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and for his theory of historical-cultural types.\n\nDanilevsky was born in the village of Oberets in Oryol Governorate. As a member of a noble family, he was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. After graduation, he went on to an appointment with the Military Ministry Office. Dissatisfied with the prospect of a military career, he began to attend the University of St Petersburg, where he studied physics and mathematics.\n\nHaving passed his master's exams, Danilevsky prepared to defend his thesis on the flora of the Black Sea area of European Russia but in 1849 he was arrested there for his membership in the Petrashevsky Circle, which studied the work of French socialists and included Fyodor Dostoevsky. Its most active members were sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. Danilevsky was imprisoned for 100 days in the Peter and Paul Fortress and then was sent to live under police surveillance in Vologda, where he worked in provincial administration.\n\nIn 1852, he was appointed to an expedition, led by Karl Ernst von Baer, to assess the condition of the fishing industry on the Volga and the Caspian Sea. The expedition lasted four years, and Danilevsky was then reassigned to the Agricultural Department of the State Property Ministry. For over 20 years, he was responsible for expeditions to the White Sea, the Black Sea, the Azov Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The expertise that he gained from the expeditions led to the publication of his 1872 book, \"Examination of Fishery Conditions in Russia\".\n\nAside from his work on fisheries and the seal trade, he was the head of the commission setting the rules for the use of running water in Crimea from 1872 to 1879. He ran the Nikitsky Botanical Gardens from 1879 to 1880, and he was part of a commission appointed to deal with the phylloxera epidemic in the 1880s. His papers on Russian climatology, geology, geography, and ethnology earned him a gold medal from the Russian Geographical Society.\n\nDanilevsky died in Tbilisi, Tiflis Governorate, and was buried at his estate, in Mshanka.\n\nDanilevsky's \"Darwinism: Critical research,\" which brings together more than 1200 pages of arguments against Darwin's theory, mostly assembled from the literature that already existed at the time, was published in 1885. It was meant to be the first volume of a longer work, the second volume containing Danilevsky's own theories, which he characterised as \"natural theology\", but it was unfinished at his death. When it was published posthumously, it contained only preliminary studies.\n\nDanilevsky had been influenced by the work of von Baer, who had developed his own teleological theory of evolution and gone on to criticise Darwin's work in the 1870s. Danilevsky took from von Baer's theory the notion of \"Zielstrebigkeit\". The German word means \"singleness of purpose\" but Danilevsky imbued it with a religious aspect and argued that evolution, as well as the original creation of the world, has a rational purpose and follows the will of a divine creator.\n\nDanilevsky first published \"Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World\" in the journal \"Zarya\" in 1869. Later republished as a monograph, it brought him international fame.\n\nHe pioneered the use of biological and morphological metaphors in the comparison of cultures. Danilevsky compared cultures and nations to biological species, denied their commonality and argued that each nation or civilisation is united by its language and culture, which it cannot pass on to any other nation. He thus characterised Peter the Great's reforms in Russia as doomed to failure, as they had attempted to impose alien values on the Slavic world.\n\nDanilevsky distinguished four categories of historical-cultural activity:\n\n\nThey gave rise to ten historical-cultural types:\n\n\nDanilevsky applied his teleological theory of evolution by stating that each type went through various predetermined stages of youth, adulthood, and old age, the last being the end of that type. He characterised the Slavic type as being at the youth stage, and he developed a socio-political plan for its development, involving unification of the Slavic world, with its future capital at Constantinople (now Istanbul), ruled by an Orthodox emperor. While other cultures would degenerate in their blind struggle for existence, the Slavic world should be viewed as a Messiah among them. Danilevsky, however, believed that there is no genuine or absolute progress, as history is circular.\n\nAspects of Danilevsky's book prefigured some of the theories in Oswald Spengler's \"The Decline of the West\". Arnold J. Toynbee mentions them in \"A Study of History\". The Danilevsky hypothesis became the subject of much controversy and polarised its readers. On one hand, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy praised it, but on the other hand, Occidentalists, such as Nikolai Kareev, Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943) and Nikolai Mikhailovsky (1842-1904), strongly opposed it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "643021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=643021", "title": "Non-standard calculus", "text": "Non-standard calculus\n\nIn mathematics, non-standard calculus is the modern application of infinitesimals, in the sense of non-standard analysis, to differential and integral calculus. It provides a rigorous justification for some arguments in calculus that were previously considered merely heuristic.\n\nNonrigourous calculations with infinitesimals were widely used before Karl Weierstrass sought to replace them with the (ε, δ)-definition of limit starting in the 1870s. (See history of calculus.) For almost one hundred years thereafter, mathematicians like Richard Courant viewed infinitesimals as being naive and vague or meaningless. \n\nContrary to such views, Abraham Robinson showed in 1960 that infinitesimals are precise, clear, and meaningful, building upon work by Edwin Hewitt and Jerzy Łoś. According to Howard Keilser, \"Robinson solved a three hundred year old problem by giving a precise treatment of infinitesimals. Robinson's achievement will probably rank as one of the major mathematical advances of the twentieth century.\"\n\nThe history of non-standard calculus began with the use of infinitely small quantities, called infinitesimals in calculus. The use of infinitesimals can be found the foundations of calculus independently developed by Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton starting in the 1660s. John Wallis refined earlier techniques of indivisibles of Cavalieri and others by exploiting an infinitesimal quantity he denoted formula_1 in area calculations, preparing the ground for integral calculus. They drew on the work of such mathematicians as Pierre de Fermat, Isaac Barrow and René Descartes.\n\nIn early calculus the use of infinitesimal quantities was criticized by a number of authors, most notably Michel Rolle and Bishop Berkeley in his book \"The Analyst\".\n\nSeveral mathematicians, including Maclaurin and d'Alembert, advocated the use of limits. Augustin Louis Cauchy developed a versatile spectrum of foundational approaches, including a definition of continuity in terms of infinitesimals and a (somewhat imprecise) prototype of an ε, δ argument in working with differentiation. Karl Weierstrass formalized the concept of limit in the context of a (real) number system without infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on ε, δ arguments instead of infinitesimals.\n\nThis approach formalized by Weierstrass came to be known as the \"standard\" calculus. After many years of the infinitesimal approach to calculus having fallen into disuse other than as an introductory pedagogical tool, use of infinitesimal quantities was finally given a rigorous foundation by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s. Robinson's approach is called non-standard analysis to distinguish it from the standard use of limits. This approach used technical machinery from mathematical logic to create a theory of hyperreal numbers that interpret infinitesimals in a manner that allows a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. An alternative approach, developed by Edward Nelson, finds infinitesimals on the ordinary real line itself, and involves a modification of the foundational setting by extending ZFC through the introduction of a new unary predicate \"standard\".\n\nTo calculate the derivative formula_2 of the function formula_3 at \"x\", both approaches agree on the algebraic manipulations:\n\nThis becomes a computation of the derivatives using the hyperreals if we interpret formula_5 as an infinitesimal and let the symbol \"formula_6\" be the relation \"is infinitely close to\".\n\nIn order to make \"f \"' a real-valued function, we must dispense with the final term formula_5. In the standard approach using only real numbers, that is done by taking the limit as formula_5 tends to zero. In the hyperreal approach, the quantity formula_5 is taken to be an infinitesimal, a nonzero number that is closer to 0 than to any nonzero real. The manipulations displayed above then show that formula_10 is infinitely close to 2\"x\", so the derivative of \"f\" at \"x\" is then 2\"x\".\n\nDiscarding the \"error term\" is accomplished by an application of the standard part function. Dispensing with infinitesimal error terms was historically considered paradoxical by some writers, most notably George Berkeley.\n\nOnce the hyperreal number system (an infinitesimal-enriched continuum) is in place, one has successfully incorporated a large part of the technical difficulties at the foundational level. Thus, the epsilon, delta techniques that some believe to be the essence of analysis can be implemented once and for all at the foundational level, and the students needn't be \"dressed to perform multiple-quantifier logical stunts on pretense of being taught infinitesimal calculus\", to quote a recent study. More specifically, the basic concepts of calculus such as continuity, derivative, and integral can be defined using infinitesimals without reference to epsilon, delta (see next section).\n\nKeisler's defines continuity on page 125 in terms of infinitesimals, to the exclusion of epsilon, delta methods.\nThe derivative is defined on page 45 using infinitesimals rather than an epsilon-delta approach.\nThe integral is defined on page 183 in terms of infinitesimals.\nEpsilon, delta definitions are introduced on page 282.\n\nThe hyperreals can be constructed in the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the standard axiomatisation of set theory used elsewhere in mathematics. To give an intuitive idea for the hyperreal approach, note that, naively speaking, non-standard analysis postulates the existence of positive numbers ε \"which are infinitely small\", meaning that ε is smaller than any standard positive real, yet greater than zero. Every real number \"x\" is surrounded by an infinitesimal \"cloud\" of hyperreal numbers infinitely close to it. To define the derivative of \"f\" at a standard real number \"x\" in this approach, one no longer needs an infinite limiting process as in standard calculus. Instead, one sets\n\nwhere st is the standard part function, yielding the real number infinitely close to the hyperreal argument of st, and formula_12 is the natural extension of formula_13 to the hyperreals.\n\nA real function \"f\" is continuous at a standard real number \"x\" if for every hyperreal \"x' \" infinitely close to \"x\", the value \"f\"(\"x' \") is also infinitely close to \"f\"(\"x\"). This captures Cauchy's definition of continuity as presented in his 1821 textbook Cours d'Analyse, p. 34.\n\nHere to be precise, \"f\" would have to be replaced by its natural hyperreal extension usually denoted \"f\" (see discussion of Transfer principle in main article at non-standard analysis).\n\nUsing the notation formula_6 for the relation of being infinitely close as above,\nthe definition can be extended to arbitrary (standard or non-standard) points as follows:\n\nA function \"f\" is \"microcontinuous\" at \"x\" if whenever formula_15, one has formula_16\n\nHere the point x' is assumed to be in the domain of (the natural extension of) \"f\".\n\nThe above requires fewer quantifiers than the (\"ε\", \"δ\")-definition familiar from standard elementary calculus:\n\n\"f\" is continuous at \"x\" if for every \"ε\" > 0, there exists a \"δ\" > 0 such that for every \"x' \", whenever |\"x\" − \"x' \"| < \"δ\", one has |\"f\"(\"x\") − \"f\"(\"x' \")| < \"ε\".\n\nA function \"f\" on an interval \"I\" is uniformly continuous if its natural extension \"f\"* in \"I\"* has the following property (see Keisler, Foundations of Infinitesimal Calculus ('07), p. 45):\n\nfor every pair of hyperreals \"x\" and \"y\" in \"I\"*, if formula_17 then formula_18.\n\nIn terms of microcontinuity defined in the previous section, this can be stated as follows: a real function is uniformly continuous if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous at every point of the domain of f*.\n\nThis definition has a reduced quantifier complexity when compared with the standard (ε, δ)-definition. Namely, the epsilon-delta definition of uniform continuity requires four quantifiers, while the infinitesimal definition requires only two quantifiers. It has the same quantifier complexity as the definition of uniform continuity in terms of \"sequences\" in standard calculus, which however is not expressible in the first-order language of the real numbers.\n\nThe hyperreal definition can be illustrated by the following three examples.\n\nExample 1: a function \"f\" is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval (0,1], if and only if its natural extension f* is microcontinuous (in the sense of the formula above) at every positive infinitesimal, in addition to continuity at the standard points of the interval.\n\nExample 2: a function \"f\" is uniformly continuous on the semi-open interval [0,∞) if and only if it is continuous at the standard points of the interval, and in addition, the natural extension \"f\"* is microcontinuous at every positive infinite hyperreal point.\n\nExample 3: similarly, the failure of uniform continuity for the squaring function\n\nis due to the absence of microcontinuity at a single infinite hyperreal point, see below.\n\nConcerning quantifier complexity, the following remarks were made by Kevin Houston:\n\nAndreas Blass wrote as follows:\n\nA set A is compact if and only if its natural extension A* has the following property: every point in A* is infinitely close to a point of A. Thus, the open interval (0,1) is not compact because its natural extension contains positive infinitesimals which are not infinitely close to any positive real number.\n\nThe fact that a continuous function on a compact interval \"I\" is necessarily uniformly continuous (the Heine–Cantor theorem) admits a succinct hyperreal proof. Let \"x\", \"y\" be hyperreals in the natural extension \"I*\" of \"I\". Since \"I\" is compact, both st(\"x\") and st(\"y\") belong to \"I\". If \"x\" and \"y\" were infinitely close, then by the triangle inequality, they would have the same standard part\n\nSince the function is assumed continuous at c, we have\n\nand therefore \"f\"(\"x\") and \"f\"(\"y\") are infinitely close, proving uniform continuity of \"f\".\n\nLet \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" defined on formula_24. Let formula_25 be an infinite hyperreal. The hyperreal number formula_26 is infinitely close to \"N\". Meanwhile, the difference\n\nis not infinitesimal. Therefore, \"f*\" fails to be microcontinuous at the hyperreal point \"N\". Thus, the squaring function is not uniformly continuous, according to the definition in uniform continuity above.\n\nA similar proof may be given in the standard setting .\n\nConsider the Dirichlet function\n\nIt is well known that, under the standard definition of continuity, the function is discontinuous at every point. Let us check this in terms of the hyperreal definition of continuity above, for instance let us show that the Dirichlet function is not continuous at π. Consider the continued fraction approximation a of π. Now let the index n be an infinite hypernatural number. By the transfer principle, the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes the value 1 at a. Note that the hyperrational point a is infinitely close to π. Thus the natural extension of the Dirichlet function takes different values (0 and 1) at these two infinitely close points, and therefore the Dirichlet function is not continuous at \"π\".\n\nWhile the thrust of Robinson's approach is that one can dispense with the approach using multiple quantifiers, the notion of limit can be easily recaptured in terms of the standard part function st, namely\n\nif and only if whenever the difference \"x\" − \"a\" is infinitesimal, the difference \"f\"(\"x\") − \"L\" is infinitesimal, as well, or in formulas:\n\ncf. (ε, δ)-definition of limit.\n\nGiven a sequence of real numbers formula_30, if formula_31 we say \"L\" is the limit of the sequence and write\n\nif for every infinite hypernatural \"n\", we have st(x)=L (here the extension principle is used to define x for every hyperinteger n).\n\nThis definition has no quantifier alternations.The standard (ε, δ)-style definition on the other hand does have quantifier alternations:\n\nTo show that a real continuous function \"f\" on [0,1] has a maximum, let \"N\" be an infinite hyperinteger. The interval [0, 1] has a natural hyperreal extension. The function \"f\" is also naturally extended to hyperreals between 0 and 1. Consider the partition of the hyperreal interval [0,1] into \"N\" subintervals of equal infinitesimal length 1/\"N\", with partition points \"x\" = \"i\" /\"N\" as \"i\" \"runs\" from 0 to \"N\". In the standard setting (when \"N\" is finite), a point with the maximal value of \"f\" can always be chosen among the \"N\"+1 points \"x\", by induction. Hence, by the transfer principle, there is a hyperinteger \"i\" such that 0 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"N\" and formula_34 for all \"i\" = 0, …, \"N\" (an alternative explanation is that every hyperfinite set admits a maximum). Consider the real point\n\nwhere st is the standard part function. An arbitrary real point \"x\" lies in a suitable sub-interval of the partition, namely formula_36, so that st(\"x\") = \"x\". Applying st to the inequality formula_34, we obtain formula_38.

Consider a partition of [\"a,b\"] into \"N\" intervals of equal length, with partition points \"x\" as \"i\" runs from 0 to \"N\". Consider the collection \"I\" of indices such that \"f(x)>0\".

{"id": "54423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54423", "title": "Phase transition", "text": "Phase transition\n\nThe term phase transition (or phase change) is most commonly used to describe transitions between solid, liquid, and gaseous states of matter, as well as plasma in rare cases. A phase of a thermodynamic system and the states of matter have uniform physical properties. During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change, often discontinuously, as a result of the change of some external condition, such as temperature, pressure, or others. For example, a liquid may become gas upon heating to the boiling point, resulting in an abrupt change in volume. The measurement of the external conditions at which the transformation occurs is termed the phase transition. Phase transitions commonly occur in nature and are used today in many technologies.\n\nExamples of phase transitions include:\n\n\nPhase transitions occur when the thermodynamic free energy of a system is non-analytic for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. phases). This condition generally stems from the interactions of a large number of particles in a system, and does not appear in systems that are too small. It is important to note that phase transitions can occur and are defined for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum phase transitions, dynamic phase transitions, and topological (structural) phase transitions. In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature. For instance, connection probability replaces temperature for percolating networks.\n\nAt the phase transition point (for instance, boiling point) the two phases of a substance, liquid and vapor, have identical free energies and therefore are equally likely to exist. Below the boiling point, the liquid is the more stable state of the two, whereas above the gaseous form is preferred.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to change the state of a system diabatically (as opposed to adiabatically) in such a way that it can be brought past a phase transition point without undergoing a phase transition. The resulting state is metastable, i.e., less stable than the phase to which the transition would have occurred, but not unstable either. This occurs in superheating, supercooling, and supersaturation, for example.\n\nPaul Ehrenfest classified phase transitions based on the behavior of the thermodynamic free energy as a function of other thermodynamic variables. Under this scheme, phase transitions were labeled by the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition. \"First-order phase transitions\" exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the free energy with respect to some thermodynamic variable. The various solid/liquid/gas transitions are classified as first-order transitions because they involve a discontinuous change in density, which is the (inverse of the) first derivative of the free energy with respect to pressure. \"Second-order phase transitions\" are continuous in the first derivative (the order parameter, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the external field, is continuous across the transition) but exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of the free energy. These include the ferromagnetic phase transition in materials such as iron, where the magnetization, which is the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the applied magnetic field strength, increases continuously from zero as the temperature is lowered below the Curie temperature. The magnetic susceptibility, the second derivative of the free energy with the field, changes discontinuously. Under the Ehrenfest classification scheme, there could in principle be third, fourth, and higher-order phase transitions.\n\nThough useful, Ehrenfest's classification has been found to be an incomplete method of classifying phase transitions, for it does not take into account the case where a derivative of free energy diverges (which is only possible in the thermodynamic limit). For instance, in the ferromagnetic transition, the heat capacity diverges to infinity. The same phenomenon is also seen in superconducting phase transition.\n\nIn the modern classification scheme, phase transitions are divided into two broad categories, named similarly to the Ehrenfest classes:\n\nFirst-order phase transitions are those that involve a latent heat. During such a transition, a system either absorbs or releases a fixed (and typically large) amount of energy per volume. During this process, the temperature of the system will stay constant as heat is added: the system is in a \"mixed-phase regime\" in which some parts of the system have completed the transition and others have not. Familiar examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water (the water does not instantly turn into vapor, but forms a turbulent mixture of liquid water and vapor bubbles). Imry and Wortis showed that quenched disorder can broaden a first-order transition. That is, the transformation is completed over a finite range of temperatures, but phenomena like supercooling and superheating survive and hysteresis is observed on thermal cycling.\n\nSecond-order phase transitions are also called \"continuous phase transitions\". They are characterized by a divergent susceptibility, an infinite correlation length, and a power-law decay of correlations near criticality. Examples of second-order phase transitions are the ferromagnetic transition, superconducting transition (for a Type-I superconductor the phase transition is second-order at zero external field and for a Type-II superconductor the phase transition is second-order for both normal-state—mixed-state and mixed-state—superconducting-state transitions) and the superfluid transition. In contrast to viscosity, thermal expansion and heat capacity of amorphous materials show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature which enables accurate detection using differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Lev Landau gave a phenomenological theory of second-order phase transitions.\n\nApart from isolated, simple phase transitions, there exist transition lines as well as multicritical points, when varying external parameters like the magnetic field or composition.\n\nSeveral transitions are known as \"infinite-order phase transitions\".\nThey are continuous but break no symmetries. The most famous example is the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition in the two-dimensional XY model. Many quantum phase transitions, e.g., in two-dimensional electron gases, belong to this class.\n\nThe liquid–glass transition is observed in many polymers and other liquids that can be supercooled far below the melting point of the crystalline phase. This is atypical in several respects. It is not a transition between thermodynamic ground states: it is widely believed that the true ground state is always crystalline. Glass is a \"quenched disorder\" state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon: on cooling a liquid, internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium. Some theoretical methods predict an underlying phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times. No direct experimental evidence supports the existence of these transitions.\n\nA disorder-broadened first-order transition occurs over a finite range of temperatures where the fraction of the low-temperature equilibrium phase grows from zero to one (100%) as the temperature is lowered. This continuous variation of the coexisting fractions with temperature raised interesting possibilities. On cooling, some liquids vitrify into a glass rather than transform to the equilibrium crystal phase. This happens if the cooling rate is faster than a critical cooling rate, and is attributed to the molecular motions becoming so slow that the molecules cannot rearrange into the crystal positions. This slowing down happens below a glass-formation temperature Tg, which may depend on the applied pressure. If the first-order freezing transition occurs over a range of temperatures, and Tg falls within this range, then there is an interesting possibility that the transition is arrested when it is partial and incomplete. Extending these ideas to first-order magnetic transitions being arrested at low temperatures, resulted in the observation of incomplete magnetic transitions, with two magnetic phases coexisting, down to the lowest temperature. First reported in the case of a ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic transition, such persistent phase coexistence has now been reported across a variety of first-order magnetic transitions. These include colossal-magnetoresistance manganite materials, magnetocaloric materials, magnetic shape memory materials, and other materials.\nThe interesting feature of these observations of Tg falling within the temperature range over which the transition occurs is that the first-order magnetic transition is influenced by magnetic field, just like the structural transition is influenced by pressure. The relative ease with which magnetic fields can be controlled, in contrast to pressure, raises the possibility that one can study the interplay between Tg and Tc in an exhaustive way. Phase coexistence across first-order magnetic transitions will then enable the resolution of outstanding issues in understanding glasses.\n\nIn any system containing liquid and gaseous phases, there exists a special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the critical point, at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition. Near the critical point, the fluid is sufficiently hot and compressed that the distinction between the liquid and gaseous phases is almost non-existent. This is associated with the phenomenon of critical opalescence, a milky appearance of the liquid due to density fluctuations at all possible wavelengths (including those of visible light).\n\nPhase transitions often involve a symmetry breaking process. For instance, the cooling of a fluid into a crystalline solid breaks continuous translation symmetry: each point in the fluid has the same properties, but each point in a crystal does not have the same properties (unless the points are chosen from the lattice points of the crystal lattice). Typically, the high-temperature phase contains more symmetries than the low-temperature phase due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, with the exception of certain accidental symmetries (e.g. the formation of heavy virtual particles, which only occurs at low temperatures).\n\nAn order parameter is a measure of the degree of order across the boundaries in a phase transition system; it normally ranges between zero in one phase (usually above the critical point) and nonzero in the other. At the critical point, the order parameter susceptibility will usually diverge.\n\nAn example of an order parameter is the net magnetization in a ferromagnetic system undergoing a phase transition. For liquid/gas transitions, the order parameter is the difference of the densities.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective, order parameters arise from symmetry breaking. When this happens, one needs to introduce one or more extra variables to describe the state of the system. For example, in the ferromagnetic phase, one must provide the net magnetization, whose direction was spontaneously chosen when the system cooled below the Curie point. However, note that order parameters can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions. Some phase transitions, such as superconducting and ferromagnetic, can have order parameters for more than one degree of freedom. In such phases, the order parameter may take the form of a complex number, a vector, or even a tensor, the magnitude of which goes to zero at the phase transition.\n\nThere also exist dual descriptions of phase transitions in terms of disorder parameters. These indicate the presence of line-like excitations such as vortex- or defect lines.\n\nSymmetry-breaking phase transitions play an important role in cosmology. It has been speculated by Lee Smolin and Jeremy Bernstein that, in the hot early universe, the vacuum (i.e. the various quantum fields that fill space) possessed a large number of symmetries. As the universe expanded and cooled, the vacuum underwent a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions. For example, the electroweak transition broke the SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the electroweak field into the U(1) symmetry of the present-day electromagnetic field. This transition is important to understanding the asymmetry between the amount of matter and antimatter in the present-day universe (see electroweak baryogenesis.)\n\nProgressive phase transitions in an expanding universe are implicated in the development of order in the universe, as is illustrated by the work of Eric Chaisson and David Layzer. See also Relational order theories.\n\nContinuous phase transitions are easier to study than first-order transitions due to the absence of latent heat, and they have been discovered to have many interesting properties. The phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions are called critical phenomena, due to their association with critical points.\n\nIt turns out that continuous phase transitions can be characterized by parameters known as critical exponents. The most important one is perhaps the exponent describing the divergence of the thermal correlation length by approaching the transition. For instance, let us examine the behavior of the heat capacity near such a transition. We vary the temperature of the system while keeping all the other thermodynamic variables fixed, and find that the transition occurs at some critical temperature \"T\" . When is near \"T\" , the heat capacity typically has a power law behavior,\n\nThe heat capacity of amorphous materials has such a behaviour near the glass transition temperature where the universal critical exponent α = 0.59 A similar behavior, but with the exponent instead of , applies for the correlation length.\n\nThe exponent is positive. This is different with . Its actual value depends on the type of phase transition we are considering.\n\nIt is widely believed that the critical exponents are the same above and below the critical temperature. It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then some exponents (such as formula_2, the exponent of the susceptibility) are not identical.\n\nFor −1 < α < 0, the heat capacity has a \"kink\" at the transition temperature. This is the behavior of liquid helium at the lambda transition from a normal state to the superfluid state, for which experiments have found = -0.013±0.003.\nAt least one experiment was performed in the zero-gravity conditions of an orbiting satellite to minimize pressure differences in the sample. This experimental value of α agrees with theoretical predictions based on variational perturbation theory.\n\nFor 0 < < 1, the heat capacity diverges at the transition temperature (though, since < 1, the enthalpy stays finite). An example of such behavior is the 3D ferromagnetic phase transition. In the three-dimensional Ising model for uniaxial magnets, detailed theoretical studies have yielded the exponent ∼ +0.110.\n\nSome model systems do not obey a power-law behavior. For example, mean field theory predicts a finite discontinuity of the heat capacity at the transition temperature, and the two-dimensional Ising model has a logarithmic divergence. However, these systems are limiting cases and an exception to the rule. Real phase transitions exhibit power-law behavior.\n\nSeveral other critical exponents, , and , are defined, examining the power law behavior of a measurable physical quantity near the phase transition. Exponents are related by scaling relations, such as\nIt can be shown that there are only two independent exponents, e.g. and .\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that phase transitions arising in different systems often possess the same set of critical exponents. This phenomenon is known as \"universality\". For example, the critical exponents at the liquid–gas critical point have been found to be independent of the chemical composition of the fluid.\n\nMore impressively, but understandably from above, they are an exact match for the critical exponents of the ferromagnetic phase transition in uniaxial magnets. Such systems are said to be in the same universality class. Universality is a prediction of the renormalization group theory of phase transitions, which states that the thermodynamic properties of a system near a phase transition depend only on a small number of features, such as dimensionality and symmetry, and are insensitive to the underlying microscopic properties of the system. Again, the divergence of the correlation length is the essential point.\n\nThere are also other critical phenomena; e.g., besides \"static functions\" there is also \"critical dynamics\". As a consequence, at a phase transition one may observe critical slowing down or \"speeding up\". The large \"static universality classes\" of a continuous phase transition split into smaller \"dynamic universality\" classes. In addition to the critical exponents, there are also universal relations for certain static or dynamic functions of the magnetic fields and temperature differences from the critical value.\n\nAnother phenomenon which shows phase transitions and critical exponents is percolation. The simplest example is perhaps percolation in a two dimensional square lattice. Sites are randomly occupied with probability p. For small values of p the occupied sites form only small clusters. At a certain threshold p a giant cluster is formed and we have a second-order phase transition. The behavior of P near p is, P~(p-p), where β is a critical exponent.\n\nPhase transitions play many important roles in biological systems. Examples include the lipid bilayer formation, the coil-globule transition in the process of protein folding and DNA melting, liquid crystal-like transitions in the process of DNA condensation, and cooperative ligand binding to DNA and proteins with the character of phase transition.\n\nIn \"biological membranes\", gel to liquid crystalline phase transitions play a critical role in physiological functioning of biomembranes. In gel phase, due to low fluidity of membrane lipid fatty-acyl chains, membrane proteins have restricted movement and thus are restrained in exercise of their physiological role. Plants depend critically on photosynthesis by chloroplast thylakoid membranes which are exposed cold environmental temperatures. Thylakoid membranes retain innate fluidity even at relatively low temperatures because of high degree of fatty-acyl disorder allowed by their high content of linolenic acid, 18-carbon chain with 3-double bonds. Gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature of biological membranes can be determined by many techniques including calorimetry, flouorescence, spin label electron paramagnetic resonance and NMR by recording measurements of the concerned parameter by at series of sample temperatures. A simple method for its determination from 13-C NMR line intensities has also been proposed.\n\nIt has been proposed that some biological systems might lie near critical points. Examples include neural networks in the salamander retina, bird flocks\ngene expression networks in Drosophila, and protein folding. However, it is not clear whether or not alternative reasons could explain some of the phenomena supporting arguments for criticality. It has also been suggested that biological organisms share two key properties of phase transitions: the change of macroscopic behavior and the coherence of a system at a critical point.\n\nIn groups of organisms in stress (when approaching critical transitions), correlations tend to increase, while at the same time, fluctuations also increase. This effect is supported by many experiments and observations of groups of people, mice, trees, and grassy plants.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22253822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22253822", "title": "Primal scene", "text": "Primal scene\n\nIn psychoanalysis, the primal scene () is the initial witnessing by a child of a sex act, usually between the parents, that traumatizes the psychosexual development of that child. The scene witnessed may also occur between animals, and be displaced onto humans.\n\nThe expression \"primal scene\" refers to the sight of sexual relations between the parents, as observed, constructed, or fantasized by the child and interpreted by the child as a scene of violence. The scene is not understood by the child, remaining enigmatic but at the same time provoking sexual excitement.\n\nThe term appeared for the first time in Freud's published work apropos of the \"Wolf Man\" case (1918b [1914]), but the notion of a sexual memory experienced too early to have been translated into verbal images, and thus liable to return in the form of conversion symptoms or obsessions, was part of his thinking as early as 1896 [as witnessed in his letter of May 30 of that year to Wilhelm Fliess, where he evokes a \"surplus of sexuality\" that \"impedes translation\" (1950a, pp. 229–230)]. Here Freud is already close to the model of the trauma and its \"deferred\" effect. The following year, in his letter to Fliess of May 2, Freud uses the actual term \"Urszene\" for the first time; and gives the approximate age when in his estimation children were liable to \"hear things\" that they would understand only \"subsequently\" as six or seven months (SE 1, p. 247). The subject of the child's witnessing parental coitus came up as well, albeit in an older child, with the case of \"Katharina,\" in the \"Studies on Hysteria\" (1895d), and Freud evoked it yet again in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\", with the fantasy of the young man who dreamed of watching his parents copulating during his life in the womb (1900a [addition of 1909], pp. 399–400).\n\nFreud persistently strove to decide whether the primal scene was a fantasy or something actually witnessed; above all, he placed increasing emphasis on the child's own fantasy interpretation of the scene as violence visited upon the mother by the father. He went so far, in \"On the Sexual Theories of Children\" (1908c, p. 221), as to find a measure of justification for what he called the \"sadistic concept of coitus\", suggesting that, though the child may exaggerate, the perception of a real repugnance towards sexual intercourse on the part of a mother fearful of another pregnancy may be quite accurate. In the case of \"Little Hans,\" however, the violence was explained in terms of a prohibition: Hans deemed it analogous to \"smashing a window-pane or forcing a way into an enclosed space\" (1909b, p. 41).\n\nThe case history of the Wolf Man gave Freud the opportunity not only to pursue the issue of the reality of the primal scene, but also to propose the idea that it lay at the root of childhood (and later adult) neurosis: the sexual development of the child was \"positively splintered up by it\" (1918b [1914), pp. 43–44). In his \"Introductory Lectures\", however, he argued for the universality of the fantasy of the primal scene (like the sexual theories of children): it may be encountered in all neurotics, if not in every human being (Freud, 1915f), and it belongs in the category of \"primal\" fantasies. It appears, however, not to have the same force for all individuals. Freud would later assign a central place to the primal scene in his analysis of Marie Bonaparte, although in her case the scene took place between her nanny and a groom (Bonaparte, 1950–53).\n\nLooked upon as an actual event rather than as a pure fantasy reconstructed in a retrospective way (as with Carl Jung's \"zurückphantasieren\"), the primal scene had a much more marked traumatic impact, and this led Freud to insist on the \"reality\" of such scenes, thus returning to the debate over event-driven (or \"historical\") reality versus psychic reality. Beyond the issue of the scene itself, however, it was the whole subject of fantasy that was thus raised (in chapter five of the Wolf Man case-history [1918b, pp. 48–60]), discussed in terms that would be picked up by Freud again later in \"Constructions in Analysis\" (1937d).\n\nIt was not merely, in Freud's view, that the technique of psychoanalysis demanded that fantasies be treated as realities so as to give their evocation all the force they needed, but also that many \"real\" scenes were not accessible by way of recollection, but solely by way of dreams. Whether a scene was constructed out of elements observed elsewhere and in a different context (for example, animal coitus transposed to the parents); reconstituted on the basis of clues (such as bloodstained sheets); or indeed observed directly, but at an age when the child still had not the corresponding verbal images at its disposal; did not fundamentally alter the basic facts of the matter: \"I intend on this occasion,\" wrote Freud, \"to close the discussion of the reality of the primal scene with a non liquet\" (1918b, p. 60).\n\nMelanie Klein's view of the primal scene differed from Freud's, for where Freud saw an enigmatic perception of violence, she saw the child's projective fantasies. Klein considered that a child's curiosity was first provoked by the primal scene, and that typically the child felt both excited and excluded by the primal scene. The sexual relationship between the parents, fantasized as continuous, is also the basis of the \"combined-parent figure\", mother and father seen as locked in mutual (but excluding) gratification.\n\nWhere Klein laid emphasis on the way the infant projected hostile and destructive tendencies onto the primal scene, with the mother pictured therein as just as dangerous for the father as the father is for her, later Kleinians like John Steiner have stressed the creative aspect of the primal scene; and the necessity in analysis of overcoming a splitting of its image between a loving couple on the one hand, and a combined parent figure locked in hate.\n\nThe primal scene is inseparable from the sexual theories of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness the libidinal excitement the child feels in response. Otto Fenichel has stressed the traumatic nature of the excess excitement felt by the child, which they are unable to process — what he called the \"overwhelming unknown\".\n\nThe particularity of the primal scene lies in the fact that the subject experiences in a simultaneous and contradictory way the emergence of the unknown within a familiar world, to which they are bound by vital needs, by expectations of pleasure, and by the self-image that it reflects back to them. The lack of common measure between the child's emotional and psychosexual experience and the words that could give an account of the primal scene creates a gulf that the sexual theories of childhood attempt to bridge. A sadistic reading of the scene combines the child's curiosity about both the origin and the end of life in a representation in which death and life are indeed fused.\n\nNed Lukacher has proposed using the term in literary criticism to refer to a kind of intertextuality in which the ability to interpret one text depends on the meaning of another text. It is \"the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\n\n——.

Various types of procrastination (such as academic/non academic or behavioural/ indecisive) have their own underlying causes and effects. The most prominent explanation in present literature draws upon \"Intemporal discounting, task averseness and certain personality traits such as indecisiveness and distractibility\" as the common causes of procrastination.\n\nA study of behavioural patterns of pigeons through delayed reward suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans, but can also be observed in some animals.\n\nLatin: \"procrastinare\", \"pro-\", 'forward', with \"-crastinus\", 'till next day' from \"cras\", 'tomorrow'\n\nIn a study of academic procrastination from the University of Vermont, published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they \"always\" or \"nearly always\" procrastinate writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.\n\nA 1992 study showed that \"52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination.\" It is estimated that 80–95% of college students engage in procrastination, and approximately 75% consider themselves procrastinators.\n\nIn a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater on tasks that were perceived as unpleasant or as impositions than on tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.\n\nGregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying. Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is \"to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay.\" Sabini & Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay.\n\nAn approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the temporal motivation theory. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.\n\nThe pleasure principle may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress. Some psychologists cite such behavior as a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision.\nPiers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be impulsiveness. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.\n\nNegative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and cognitive dissonance) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand. There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian defense mechanisms, coping styles and self-handicapping. \nCoping responses of procrastinators include the following.\n\n\nTask- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator's outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one's behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.\n\nIn 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by conscientiousness.\nIn 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. \"Putting things off even until the last moment isn't procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment\". Steel \"et al.\" explained in 2001, \"actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning\".\n\nTo a certain degree it is normal to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks (for most people). On the other hand, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigma and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder, but not necessarily.\n\nResearch on the physiological roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a lack thereof. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one's ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe's role in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, where it is commonly underactivated.\n\nIn a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in fraternal- and identical twin pairs, both traits were found to be \"moderately heritable\". The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (r = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found. The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: \"(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation.\"\n\nPsychologist William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate. Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education (college dropouts).\n\nPerfectionism is a prime cause for procrastination because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning, to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.\n\nBehaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:\n\nMaking a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.\n\nPiers Steel suggests that better time management is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one's \"power hours\" (being a \"morning person\" or \"night owl\"). A good approach is to creatively utilize one's internal circadian rhythms that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the \"small successes\". Brian O'Leary supports that \"finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive\", suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one's efficiency at handling tasks.\n\nAfter contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher John Perry authored an essay entitled \"Structured Procrastination\", wherein he proposes a \"cheat\" method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a pyramid scheme to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order. In other words, the procrastinator should postpone tasks with a mental note that one feels to do while engaged in a work that requires their current attentional focus.\n\nFor some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may be symptomatic of a psychological disorder. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as depression, irrational behaviour, low self-esteem, anxiety and neurological disorders such as ADHD. Others have found relationships with guilt and stress. Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained therapist or psychiatrist to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.\n\nWith a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits, to the extent that, overall, procrastinators suffer more stress and health problems.\n\nProcrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of cognitive, affective and behavioral relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and anxiety to depression. A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with hedonistic perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.\n\nA correlation between procrastination and eveningness was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate. It has been shown that Morningness increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age., \n\nTraditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and \"workaholism\". However, adaptive perfectionists—egosyntonic perfectionism—were \"less\" likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—egodystonic perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.\nIn a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with \"the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling\".\n\nAccording to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient time management skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination.\n\n\"Student syndrome\" refers to the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themself to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task duration estimates. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.\nIn one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline.\n\nOther reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.\n\nProcrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.\n\nIn 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in the \"Journal of Social Psychology\" intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.\n\nDifferent findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s \"irrational\" and \"postponement\" criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises \"tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed.\"\n\nProcrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.\n\n\n\n"}

A randomizing function from the integers 1 to \"n\" to the integers 1 to \"n\" can be used to rerrange the \"n\" input items in \"random\" order, before calling that algorithm. This modified (randomized) algorithm will have small expected running time, whatever the input order.\n\nIn theory, randomization functions are assumed to be truly random, and yield an unpredictably different function every time the algorithm is executed. The randomization technique would not work if, at every execution of the algorithm, the randomization function always performed the same mapping, or a mapping entirely determined by some externally observable parameter (such as the program's startup time). With such a \"pseudo-randomization\" function, one could in principle construct a sequence of calls such that the function would always yield a \"bad\" case for the underlying deterministic algorithm. For that sequence of calls, the average cost would be closer to the worst-case cost, rather than the average cost for random inputs.\n\nIn practice, however, the main concern is that some \"bad\" cases for the deterministic algorithm may occur in practice much more often than it would be predicted by chance. For example, in a naive variant of quicksort, the worst case is when the input items are already sorted — which is a very common occurrence in many applications. For such algorithms, even a fixed pseudo-random permutation may be good enough. Even though the resulting \"pseudo-randomized\" algorithm would still have as many \"bad\" cases as the original, they will be certain peculiar orders that would be quite unlikely to arise in real applications. So, in practice one often uses randomization functions that are derived from pseudo-random number generators, preferably seeded with external \"random\" data such as the program's startup time.\n\nThe uniformity requirements for a randomizing function are usually much weaker than those of hash functions and pseudo-random generators. The minimum requirement is that it maps any input of the deterministic algorithm into a \"good\" input with a sufficiently high probability. (However, analysis is usually simpler if the randomizing function implements each possible mapping with uniform probability.)\n"}

Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the semantics of a language which is concerned with its meaning.\n\nThe symbols, formulas, systems, theorems, proofs, and interpretations expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.\n\nSyntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the well-formed formulas of a formal system.\n\nIn computer science, the term \"syntax\" refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed expressions in a programming language. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.\n\nA symbol is an idea, abstraction or concept, tokens of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.\n\nA \"formal language\" is a syntactic entity which consists of a set of finite strings of symbols which are its words (usually called its well-formed formulas). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of formation rules. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning.\n\n\"Formation rules\" are a precise description of which strings of symbols are the well-formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).\n\nA proposition is a sentence expressing something true or false. A proposition is identified ontologically as an idea, concept or abstraction whose token instances are patterns of symbols, marks, sounds, or strings of words. Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also truthbearers.\n\nA formal theory is a set of sentences in a formal language.\n\nA \"formal system\" (also called a \"logical calculus\", or a \"logical system\") consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a \"deductive system\"). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called \"inference rules\") or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any interpretation given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).\n\nA formula A is a syntactic consequence within some formal system formula_1 of a set Г of formulas if there is a derivation in formal system formula_1 of A from the set Г.\n\nSyntactic consequence does not depend on any interpretation of the formal system.\n\nA formal system formula_4 is \"syntactically complete\" (also \"deductively complete\", \"maximally complete\", \"negation complete\" or simply \"complete\") iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or ¬A is a theorem of formula_4. In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an inconsistency. Truth-functional propositional logic and first-order predicate logic are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable \"a\" is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not tautologies). Gödel's incompleteness theorem shows that no recursive system that is sufficiently powerful, such as the Peano axioms, can be both consistent and complete.\n\nAn \"interpretation\" of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. \"Giving an interpretation\" is synonymous with \"constructing a model\". An interpretation is expressed in a metalanguage, which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.\n\n"}

The popularization of this term is often attributed to the Chinese scholar Chih-i who spoke about the \"co-penetration of the ten worlds.\"\n\nThe ten realms are part of Buddhist cosmology and consist of four higher realms and six lower realms derived from the Indian concept of .\n\nThese realms can also be described through the degrees of enlightenment that course through them. They have been translated in various ways. They are divided into the Six Realms (六道), followed by higher states of enlightened consciousness that lead to final Buddhahood. The Six Realms are: Hell (地獄道), the Hungry Ghosts or pretas (餓鬼道), the Beasts (畜生道), the Titans or Asuras (修羅道), Humans (人道) and lastly Heaven, or the realm of the gods (天道). Above these lie the four holy states: the Śrāvaka (声聞), the Pratyekabuddha (縁覚), the bodhisattva (菩薩) and finally completely enlightened Buddhahood.\n\nIn some systems of cosmology these states are perceived as distinct realms in which the inhabitant has to experience various forms of suffering in order to expiate karma. In Japanese syncretic practices the ten realms are seen as distinct trials of discipline a practitioner must encounter or overcome in order to reach a material or spiritual goal.\n\nHowever, according to Chih-i's conceptualization of \"three thousand realms in a single moment of life,\" they are not separate physical realms into which one may be reborn but interrelated realms of consciousness, each of which is contained within each other (Jp. jikkai gogu). The Ten Realms are a conceptualization of the Lotus Sutra's worldview of the interconnected relationship of phenomena, the ultimate reality of the universe, and human agency.\n\nEach of the ten realms or worlds are contained within each realm, the \"mutual possession of the ten realms\" (Jap. \"jikkai gogu\"). The one subsequent hundred worlds are viewed through the lenses of the Ten suchnesses and the three realms of existence (Jpn. \"san-seken\") to formulate three thousand realms of existence. These hundred aspects of existence leads to the concept of \"\"three thousand realms in a single moment\" (Jap. \"Ichinen Sanzen\").\" \n\nAccording to this conception, the world of Buddha and the nine realms of humanity are interpenetrable, there is no original \"pure mind,\" and good and evil are mutually possessed. This establishes a proclivity to immanence rather than transcendency. According to Nichiren the three thousand realms in a single moment is practical and realizable in this lifetime in the concrete world.\n\nIn some Japanese traditions the ten realms are experienced in pilgrimages to a series of temples or sites along holy mountains. \n\nMore frequently, the theory of the ten realms and its larger associated concept of three thousand realms of existence in a single moment portray a non-theistic interpretation of how a person is affected by the cosmos and, in turn, has the potential to impact on the cosmos. In some schools of Nichiren Buddhism practitioners believe the calligraphic scroll Gohonzon is Nichiren's representation of the ten realms and chanting Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō to it activates the Buddha's attributes of wisdom, courage, and compassion.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4174355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4174355", "title": "The Symbolic", "text": "The Symbolic\n\nThe Symbolic (or Symbolic Order) is a part of the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, part of his attempt \"to distinguish between those elementary registers whose grounding I later put forward in these terms: the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real — a distinction never previously made in psychoanalysis\".\n\nLacan's early work was centred on an exploration of the Imaginary, of those \"specific images, which we refer to by the ancient term of \"imago\". ... it set out from their formative function in the subject\". Therefore \"[t]he notion of the \"symbolic came to the forefront in the Rome Report [1953] ... henceforth it is the symbolic, not the imaginary, that is seen to be the determining order of the subject\".\n\nLacan's concept of the symbolic \"owes much to a key event in the rise of structuralism ... the publication of Claude Lévi-Strauss's \"Elementary Structures of Kinship\" in 1949. ... In many ways, the symbolic is for Lacan an equivalent to Lévi-Strauss's order of culture\": a language-mediated order of culture. \"Man speaks, then, but it is because the symbol has made him man ... superimposes the kingdom of culture on that of a nature\". Accepting then that \"language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language\", Lacan found in Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that \"his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'\".\n\nFor a decade or so after the Rome Report, Lacan found in the concept of the symbolic an answer to the neurotic problematic of the imaginary: \"It is the task of symbolism to forbid imaginary capture ... supremacy of the symbolic over the imaginary ... supremacy of the symbolic over the real\". Accepting through Lévi-Strauss the anthropological premise that \"man is indeed an 'animal symbolicum'\", and that \"the self-illumination of society through symbols is an essential part of social reality\", Lacan made the leap to seeing \"the Oedipus complex - in so far as we continue to recognise it as covering the whole field of our experience with its signification\" - as the point whereby the weight of social reality was mediated to the developing child by the (symbolic) father: \"It is in the \"name of the Father\" that we must recognize the support of the symbolic function which, from the dawn of history, has identified his person with the figure of the law\".\n\nThe imaginary now came to be seen increasingly as belonging to the earlier, closed realm of the dual relationship of mother and child — \"Melanie Klein describes the relation to the mother as a mirrored relationship ... [neglecting] the third term, the father\" — to be broken up and opened to the wider symbolic order.\n\nLacan's shorthand for that wider world was the Other — \"the big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words [which] ... are public, communal property\". But though it is an essentially linguistic dimension, Lacan does not simply equate the symbolic with language, since the latter is involved also in the Imaginary and the Real. The symbolic dimension of language is that of the signifier, in which elements have no positive existence but are constituted by virtue of their mutual differences.\n\nThe unconscious is the discourse of the Other and thus belongs to the symbolic order. It is also the realm of the Law that regulates desire in the Oedipus complex, and is determinant of subjectivity. \"The unconscious is the sum of the effects of speech on a subject, at the level at which the subject constitutes himself out of the effects of the signifier ... we depend on the field of the Other, which was there long before we came into the world, and whose circulating structures determine us as subjects\" on the symbolic order.\n\nWith the Sixties, the early rush of expectations associated with the concept of the symbolic order had begun to fade, and the symbolic was increasingly seen as \"part\" of the human condition, rather than as a therapeutic cure-all. Lacan's critical attention began to shift instead to the concept of the Real, seen as \"that over which the symbolic stumbles ... that which is lacking in the symbolic order, the ineliminable residue of all articulation ... the umbilical cord of the symbolic\".\n\nBy the turn of the decade, \"(1968–71) Lacan gradually came to dismiss the Oedipus ... as 'Freud's dream'\" — despite his own earlier warning of the dangers if \"one wishes to ignore the symbolic articulation that Freud discovered at the same time as the unconscious ... his methodical reference to the Oedipus complex\".\n\nWhether his development of the concept of \"jouissance\", or 'the \"identification with the \"sinthome\"\" (as the naming of one's Real) advocated in Lacan's last works as the aim of psychoanalysis', will in time prove as fruitful as that of the symbolic order perhaps remains to be seen. Part of Lacan's enduring legacy will surely however remain bound up with the triumphal exploration of the symbolic order that was the Rome Report: \"Symbols in fact envelop the life of man in a network so total that they join together ... the shape of his destiny\".\n\n\n\n"}

They wrote articles critiquing sexist and patriarchal structures and demanded a series of reproductive rights that included access to abortion and an end to forced sterilization. In November of 1970, women consisted of roughly forty percent of the group’s membership and were between the ages of 13 and 28. Despite their considerable presence in the YLP, female members were consistently overlooked to occupy high-ranking leadership positions. However, in 1970 Denise Oliver-Vélez was appointed as Minister of Economic Development and became the highest ranking woman in the party.\n\nWomen in the Young Lords made significant contributions to the daily maintenance of the organization. They led free breakfast programs for children in local churches as well as educational workshops for community members. Maintaining their commitment to feminism and female liberation, they worked on the Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women, which explicitly linked traditional family structures as initial sites of female oppression. The Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women was later included in \"\" (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer (see external links below for the full text of that book). The paper would go on to cement the Young Lords as a main organization in the fight for gender equality at the time. \n\nIris Morales, a former Young Lord and grassroots organizer, has worked to preserve the legacy of women in the party today. In 1994, she directed a documentary \"¡Palante, Siempre Palante!\", chronicling the life of the Young Lords from its inception in 1969 to its fragmentation and ultimate demise in 1976. Her role in documenting the history of the party and centering women throughout her work highlights another instance of female leadership in the Puerto Rican nationalist organization to this day.\n\nIn its early stages as an organization, machismo was widespread within the Young Lords. Men relegated women to peripheral roles in leadership and subjected them to stereotypical assignments like secretary work. In response to these machista attitudes, several female members formed their own women’s caucus in 1969. They met to confront sexism within the party and eventually decided to propose a change to one of the objectives in the Thirteen Point Platform, “Machismo must be revolutionary and not oppressive.”\n\nDenise Oliver-Vélez was quoted saying, “I was in the Young Lords, and one of the points in the original program was ‘Revolutionary Machismo.’ Machismo is reactionary, so you can’t have revolutionary machismo. We women weren’t having it. So we made a very different kind of statement. ‘We want equality for women. Down with machismo and male chauvinism.” To this day, that revision remains a part of the final Thirteen Point Platform.\n\nThe women’s caucus issued demands to the Central Committee of the organization that called for an end to sexual discrimination and the full inclusion of women into the leadership of the Lords. The Central Committee reacted by quickly promoting Denise Oliver-Vélez and Gloria Fontanez to the Central Committee. They also adopted a new slogan, ¡Abajo con el machismo! (Down with Machismo!). However, these changes did not happen immediately and women still faced sexism within the party regularly. Oliver-Vélez became aware of gendered assumptions made by the central committee about who could and could not perform certain tasks. Even when women were assigned to posts in various ministries, including the Defense Ministry, they were disproportionately assigned traditional \"women's work\" like child care and secretarial tasks.\n\nSome changes could be seen as stricter guidelines were placed on the men within the party to respect their female counterparts both inside and outside of the organization. For example, Felipe Luciano was demoted from his position as Central Committee chairman and organization spokesperson for being unfaithful to his wife in 1970. He was charged with “male chauvinism” and was sent back for re-education within the non-ranking cadre.\n\nOne of the major contributions women made to the success of the Young Lords Party was working on the Young Lords Party Position Paper on Women, published in 1970, which was later included in \"\" (2010), edited by Darrel Enck-Wanzer (see external links below for the full text of that book). Denise Oliver-Vélez helped construct the document and theorized the intersection of race and class in the lives of women of color. The paper outlined the expectations placed on women and how their value in society is tied to their potential in the household and in the kitchen. It indicted the practice of sterilization in Puerto Rico that had happening since the 1930s. It also denounced the use of birth control pills, since they had been tested on Puerto Rican women for fifteen years. They had been tied to cancer and death from blood clotting.\n\nWomen in the Young Lords were subject to harsh criticism and backlash by the male dominated central committee as well as men in their communities who saw their involvement as a front to culture and established gender norms. In 1970, women started making demands, occupying space in group meetings, and challenging male authority on an institutional level. Women in the Puerto Rican activist organization the Young Lords made significant contributions to the programs and platform of the Young Lords. They were situated within the ranking system and performed the labor for free meal and clothing drives. To this day, the women who made up the Young Lords from 1969-1976 struggle to receive the same recognition as their male counterparts. With the publication of \"Through the Eyes of Rebel Women: The Young Lords 1969-1976\" in 2016 by Iris Morales, more information about the role women had in the organization is coming to light and being celebrated.\n"}

Eighty percent of disabled youth live in developing countries, and therefore have even less access to education, health care, jobs and general rights Disabilities include physical, mental disabilities or mental illness. Many youth live normal and stable lives, however those with disabilities may experience more obstacles than those without due to potential limitations, those created by physical limitations and social limitations. \n\nBefore the 1970s, there were no major federal laws that protected the civil or constitutional rights of Americans with disabilities. The civil rights movement started off the \"disability rights movement\", which focused on social and therapeutic services for those with disabilities, and in 1975 the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) was created. This law establishes the rights of children with disabilities to attend public schools, to receive services designed to meet their needs free of charge, and to receive instruction in regular education classrooms alongside non-disabled children.\n\nThe IDEA also authorized federal grants to states to cover some of the costs of special education services for youth aged three to twenty-one. Additions to the law focused on improving access to general education and curriculum (inclusion programs), developing appropriate assessments, implementing appropriate disciplinary procedures and alternative placements, and creating transition services for youth leaving the education system. This transition can be difficult for youth with a disability if it is too sudden- many of these youth struggle with the independence that graduation allows. In 2004, additions were made to promote better accountability for results, enhance parent involvement, encourage the use of proven practices and materials (increase research on current practices), and reduce administrative burdens for teachers, states and local school districts. Before 1975, only one in five children with identified disabilities attended public school, and many states explicitly excluded children with certain types of disabilities from school; these included children who were blind or deaf, and children labeled \"emotionally disturbed\" or \"mentally retarded\".\n\nThe current special education system can offer many different supports and services including transportation, speech-language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation, and mobility services, medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes, school health services, social work services in school, and parent counseling and training children. Each unique student and their unique symptoms of their disability is going to require different supports from another youth with a disability (even if it is the same disability). Within the classroom, there are many different ways that teachers and administration can adjust their work to meet the needs of the youth in their classroom with disabilities. Just a few of these adaptations are curriculum modification, small-group or individual instruction, and teachers who are especially skilled in motivating students, adapting instructional materials, teaching reading skills and language arts, and managing student behaviors.Specific accommodations might include tutors or aides, more time for students to take tests, alternative tests or assessments, modified grading standards, slower-paced instruction, shorter or different assignments, more frequent feedback, a reader or interpreter, a peer tutor, or special behavior management approaches and programs.\n\nBeing a youth with a disability can create a financial burden on the individual, as well as to those who provide care and support. Their families also incur extra direct and indirect costs.. Families with disabled yout spend money on health care, therapeutic, behavioral, or educational services; transportation; caregivers; and other special needs services. Indirect costs include reductions in parents' ability to work because of additional time that is required to care for a child with a disability combined with high costs or unavailability of adequate child care. This is a similar problem to one that many families face, but disabled youth may live at home longer require more attention. These costs alone can decrease the financial stability of a family. Having a child with disabilities increases the likelihood that the mother (or less often the father) will either curtail hours of work or stop working altogether. One study showed that a decline in employment of 9% for mothers with a disabled child relative to all mothers, with a resultant estimate of approximately $3,150 in lost pay. In addition, mothers who continue to work are estimated to reduce time worked by around two hours a week, with a range of between half an hour and five hours a week.\n\nFamilies with more resources may be able to maintain financial stability, even with the financial strain of having a youth with a disability. These resources may provide treatment, affordable housing, therapy, etc. for a youth with special needs. As a conclusion from the research listed above, these children are more likely to be able to function independently from their family, and live on their own at an earlier age, than those from families that may not be able to afford these extra resources.\n\nEighty percent of people with disabilities live in resource-poor societies. They are often considered to be a burden, and carry a very negative social stigma. Many are unable to contribute to society, attend school, or find work.\n\nIn the justice system, youth are disproportionately male, poor and have significant learning or behavioral disabilities to the extent that they require services listed under the IDEA. There are 1345,000 youth incarcerated in the U.S system, and 30%-70% of these individuals are youth with disabilities.\nPsychiatric disorders occur more often among prisoners than among those outside of prison. Such illnesses relate to at least some of the difficulties former inmates experience after they are released. Those who were diagnosed with a mental disability may have a harder time readjusting to life outside of prison after being released; this often consists of repetition of crime, or difficulty maintaining independent stability financially or emotionally.\n\n"}

He received a gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and added another at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe World Taekwondo Federation banned Matos and his coach for life following an incident at the 2008 Summer Olympics where Matos kicked the Swedish referee Chakir Chelbat in the face, after being disqualified in the bronze medal match. The decision was later ratified by the IOC. He was also banned for life by the same committee.\n\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics, Matos was gold medalist in the men's middleweight (80 kg) class. In the first round, he defeated Felipe Soto Alvarez of Chile 9–2. In the quarterfinals, he defeated Victor Manuel Estrada Garibay of Mexico 2–0, besting Swede Roman Livaja in the semifinals, 4–0. In the gold medal match Matos defeated Germany's Faissal Ebnoutalib 3–1.\n\nMatos was the defending Olympic welterweight champion. At the 2003 Pan American Games, Matos was defeated 4–1 by eventual gold medalist Steven López. He was not a medalist at Athens in 2004, being ousted by Mexican Estrada 8–7, in the preliminary round of 16.\n\nIn the bronze medal match in the men's 80+ kg class at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Matos was set against Kazakhstan's Arman Chilmanov. After he incurred a foot injury (at which point he led the match 3-2), he took a Kyeshi (\"suspend\", medical timeout). Under World Taekwondo Federation tournament rules, players sustaining injury are allowed one minute of Kyeshi time, at the end of which the competitor in question must return to the center of the ring to resume the fight, request further time, or forfeit the match.\n\nSwedish referee Chakir Chelbat gave a time warning at 40 seconds, but Kyeshi elapsed without Matos returning to the center. The referee ruled while he was sitting awaiting medical attention that he had taken too long during his time out and subsequently ruled he had retired. \"To me it was obvious he was unable to continue,\" his opponent Arman Chilmanov of Kazakhstan said. \"His toe on his left foot was broken.\" After Chilmanov was declared the winner, Matos briefly argued with Chelbat and then kicked him in the face, punched a judge in the arms, and spat on the floor of the arena before being escorted out by security with his coach, Leudis Gonzalez.<ref name=\"AFP/Fox\"></ref>\n\nAfter the fight, Yang Jin-suk, the secretary general of the World Taekwondo Federation, apologised and said \"This is an insult to the Olympic vision, an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and, in my opinion, an insult to mankind.\"\n\nHours later, the WTF banned Matos and González from WTF-sanctioned events for life; in a statement announcing its decision, the WTF called Matos' behaviour \"a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the Olympic Games.\" It also deleted Matos' results from the 2008 Olympics from the records.\n\nMatos's coach Leudis González said of the referee's initial decision to end the fight, \"He was too strict...\" and accused the Kazakhstan team of offering bribes. Former Cuban president Fidel Castro also defended Matos, saying he was rightfully indignant over his disqualification. \"I saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two Cuban boxers in the semifinals,\" Castro wrote.\n"}
