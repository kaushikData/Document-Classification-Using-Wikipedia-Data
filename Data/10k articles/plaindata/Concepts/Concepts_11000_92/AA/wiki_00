{"id": "37491960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37491960", "title": "80,000 Hours", "text": "80,000 Hours\n\n80,000 Hours is a San Francisco-based organisation that conducts research on the careers with positive social impact and provides career advice. It provides this advice online, through one-on-one advice sessions and through a community of like-minded individuals. The organisation is part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, affiliated with the University of Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics. The organisation's name refers to the typical amount of time someone spends working over a lifetime. It was one of the nonprofits funded by startup accelerator Y Combinator in 2015.\n\nAccording to 80,000 Hours, some careers aimed at doing good are far more effective than others. On their framework for assessing different career options, the value of a career is regarded as depending on both its potential for impact and on the degree to which it gives the individual better opportunities to have an impact in the future.\n\nThe group emphasises that the positive impact of choosing a certain occupation should be measured by the amount of additional good that is done as a result of this choice, not by the amount of good directly done. It considers indirect ways of making a difference, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct ways, such as scientific research. The moral philosopher Peter Singer mentions the example of banking and finance as a potentially high impact career through such donations in his TED Talk, \"The why and how of effective altruism,\" where he discusses the work of 80,000 Hours. \n\nWilliam MacAskill is the Founder and President of 80,000 Hours, the Co-founder and Vice-President of Giving What We Can, and a Research Associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Oxford University.\n\n80,000 Hours has promoted the idea that pursuing a high-earning career and donating a significant portion of the income to cost-effective charities can be an effective philanthropic strategy for some people. John Humphrys criticised this idea on the BBC Today programme, saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age.\n\nThis idea was also criticised in the \"Oxford Left Review\", where Pete Mills wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system. In addition, he argues that because the likelihood of bringing about social change is difficult to quantify, 80,000 Hours is biased toward quantifiable methods of doing good.\n\nOver time 80,000 Hours has deemphasised 'earning to give', in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform, and begun recommending work on problems that are less easily quantified. \n\nDavid Brooks of \"The New York Times\" has criticised the organisation for its consequentialist approach to altruism and has argued that cultivating altruism is not purely a matter of maximising one's positive social impact.\n\nThe effective altruism movement, of which 80,000 Hours is a part, has been criticised by Ken Berger, the founder of Charity Navigator for its efforts to objectively compare and prioritise charitable causes, which he believes to be a subjective process that is the responsibility of individual donors. William MacAskill responded to this article justifying the need to figure out which charities do the most good. \n\n"}

The Nyaya school does not consider the object in front to be the \"ālambana\" of the illusory cognition but rather the interfering external element with its own characteristics. The best \"ālambana\" for the \"upasana\" of Brahman is Om.\n\nIn Vedic parlance, \"ālambana\" is also known as \"skambha\" i.e. the pillar of strength; God is the pillar of strength; it is the objective contemplation which lends support to the mind in its travel Godwards.\n\nIn the Indian theory of Rasa, \"Uddipana\" is the excitant or determinant which inflames sentiments or emotions, and \"ālambana\" is that on which the sentiment hangs i.e. \"ālambana\" is with reference to the sentiment which arises as the link between a sentiment and the cause which excites it. In \"Rasa\" process, the nature or object is said to be visibly present before the \"asraya\" as an excitant but the object that arouses emotions is usually imagined by the poet or dramatist; the mere presence of \"vibhava\" impels the configuration of \"Pratibha\" (the intuitive outcome of wisdom or knowledge) to change it in no time. As per the Rasa of Heroic devotion in compassion the enhancing excitants include transitory emotions such as impatience, understanding and happiness, and Krishna in some disguised form is offered by the hero, motivated by kindness, his own body. Yuddhisthira had made sacrificial offerings to Krishna.\n\nWith the aid of self-supported yoga or ātmālmbana yoga, Ishvara can be seen in two ways i.e. dual and non-dual, or can be seen as fourfolded. \"Ālambana\" refers to inner support and yoga refers to self-discipline; \"ātmālambana yoga\" is the discipline of objectifying the non-self with the aid of the self when the negated-self becomes the object of the self.\n\nPatanjali while defining Sleep which is a vritti of Buddhi, just as the waking state and the dream states are, tells us:\n\nHere, he has used the word, \"ālambana\", to mean support or based on i.e. absence of impressions is supported / based on inertia.\n\nAccording to the Yogacara phenomenology the \"ālambana\" condition, whether immediate direct or remote, means if there exists a dharma it will have a distinct appearance, the mind will sometimes correspond with it (\"lakshana\") for that \"dharma\" to be cognized and perceptually grasped. This condition leads to the awakening which results in the ending of the eight consciousnesses and replacing them with four enlightened cognitive abilities. The Buddhist consider \"ālambana\" as a cause same as \"hetu\", \"samanantara\" and \"adhipati\", they consider it to be the object-condition which is taken as the cause in the production of knowledge and mentals, such as \"citta\" and \"caitta\".\nAccording to Nagarjuna there are three motivational contexts of love and compassion viz, \"sattva-ālambana\", motivated by the similarity of one’s self with other selves, \"dharma-ālambana\", motivated by the sameness of psycho-physical elements, and \"ānalambana\" which is not motivated by these two i.e. which is independent of motivational context. Xuanzang in the context of Dignāga’s statement with reference to the eighth consciousness explains that the seeds or virtualities of the eighth consciousness produce the actual consciousness and also the objective base (ālambana) of actual consciousness.\n"}

Vedic texts speak, for example, of the 360 bones of the fetus that fuse into the 206 bones of the adult (after the 360 days of the year). Recently, the word has been used in a Song of a Bollywood Feature Film \" Cocktail \", Where a Man Calls a girl(Tum hi ho Bandhu)he likes and Rates her as an Angel from the outer world Connected to him. It is used commonly in \"Hindi\" in the sense of \"brother\". Synonyms: \"Hindi\", it may mean \"bhai\" as in \"Twamecha Bandhu, sakha twameva\", part of the Krishna stotra, where Lord Krishna is being referred to as \"brother\".

In the story Prajapati attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different.

{"id": "40818288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40818288", "title": "Beet vascular necrosis", "text": "Beet vascular necrosis\n\nBeet vascular necrosis and rot is a soft rot disease caused by the bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum, which has also been known as \"Pectobacterium betavasculorum\" and \"Erwinia carotovora\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\". It was classified in the genus \"Erwinia\" until genetic evidence suggested that it belongs to its own group; however, the name Erwinia is still in use. As such, the disease is sometimes called Erwinia rot today. It is a very destructive disease that has been reported across the United States as well as in Egypt. Symptoms include wilting and black streaks on the leaves and petioles. It is usually not fatal to the plant, but in severe cases the beets will become hollowed and unmarketable. The bacteria is a generalist species which rots beets and other plants by secreting digestive enzymes that break down the cell wall and parenchyma tissues. The bacteria thrive in warm and wet conditions, but cannot survive long in fallow soil. However, it is able to persist for long periods of time in the rhizosphere of weeds and non-host crops. While it is difficult to eradicate, there are cultural practices that can be used to control the spread of the disease, such as avoiding injury to the plants and reducing or eliminating application of nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nFodder beets, sugar beets and fodder-sugar crosses are all susceptible to infection by \"Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\". Today most beet cultivars are resistant to the pathogen, however, isolates vary geographically, and some cultivars of beets are only resistant to specific isolates of bacteria. For example, the cultivar USH11 demonstrates resistance to both Montana and California isolates, whereas Beta 4430 is highly susceptible to the Montana isolates but resistant to the California isolate. Other cultivars resistant to California isolates of \"Pectobacterium caratovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\" include Beta 4776R, Beta 4430R and Beta 4035R, but HH50 has been found to be susceptible.\n\nBreeding for resistance to other diseases such as beet yellows virus without also selecting for vascular necrosis resistance can leave cultivars susceptible to the pathogen. For example, the use of USH9A and H9B in California’s San Joaquin valley is thought to have led to an epiphytotic (severe) outbreak of disease in the early 1970s. This was likely because of the limited gene pool used when selecting strongly for resistance to beet yellows virus. Further information on resistant cultivars can be found in the section Management.\n\nIn addition to beets, \"Pectobacterium carotovara\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\" can also infect tomato, potato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, sunflower, artichokes, squash, cucumber and chrysanthemum. Other subspecies of \"Pectobacterium carotovora\" can also be pathogenic to beets. \"Erwinia carotovara\" subsp. \"atroseptica\" is a bacterial soft rot pathogen that is responsible for the disease Blackleg of Potato (\"Solanum tuberosum\"), and variants of this bacterium can cause root rot in sugarbeets. This subspecies also has a wide host-range. \"Erwinia carotovora\" var. \"atroseptica\" has been detected in the rhizosphere of native vegetation and on weed species such as \"Lupinus blumerii\" and \"Amaranthus palmeri\" (pigweed). It is thought that the source of inoculums survives on these non-host plants in areas in which it is endemic as well as in the rhizosphere of other crops such as wheat and corn\n\nSymptoms can be found on both beet roots and foliage, although foliar symptoms are not always present. If present, foliar symptoms include dark streaking along petioles and viscous froth deposits on the crown which are a by-product of bacterial metabolism. Petioles can also become necrotic and demonstrate vascular necrosis. When roots become severely affected, wilting also occurs. Below ground symptoms include both soft and dry root rot. Affected vascular bundles in roots become necrotic and brown, and tissue adjacent to necrosis becomes pink upon air contact. The plants that do not die completely may have rotted-out, cavernous roots.\n\nVarious pathogens can cause root rot in beets; however the black streaking on petioles and necrotic vascular bundles in roots and adjacent pink tissue help to distinguish this disease from others such as Fusarium Yellows. Additionally, sampling from the rhizosphere of infected plants and serological tests can confirm the presence of \"Erwinia caratovora\" subs.\n\n\"Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\" is a gram negative, rod bacteria with peritichous flagella. For it to enter sugar beet, and thus cause infection, it is essential that there is an injury to the leaves, petioles or crown. Infection will often start at the crown and then move down into the root, and can occur at any point in the growing season if environmental conditions are favorable.\nOnce the bacteria enters the plant, it will invade the vascular tissue and cause symptoms by producing plant cell wall degrading enzymes, like pectinases, polygalactronases, and celluases. This results in discolored or necrotic vascular tissue in the root, and the tissue bordering the vascular bundles will turn reddish upon contact with air. Following the infection of the vascular tissue, the bacteria reproduce as long as food resources are available, and the root begins to rot. There is significant variability in the type of rot – it can range from a dry rot to soft and wet rot – because of the multitude of additional microorganisms that may colonize the damaged tissue\n\nUpon death of the sugar beet, or harvest of the field, the pathogen appears to survive in select living plant tissue like beet roots, or volunteer beets. However, it does not appear to survive in sugar beet seeds, or live in the soil after harvest. It is also possible for the pathogen to infect injured carrots, potato, sweet potato, tomato, radish, sunflower, artichokes, squash, cucumber and chrysanthemums; however, since those are often planted in the same season as sugar beets, they are not likely to be overwintering hosts.\n\nInjury to the leaves, petioles or crown is mandatory for the pathogen to gain entry to the host tissue. Accordingly, hail damage is correlated with a higher degree of disease outbreak. Young plants (less than eight weeks old) are also considered to be more prone to infection\n\nTemperature and availability of moisture are key factors in determining the rate of disease development. Warm temperatures, 25-30 °C, promote rapid disease development., and can result in acute symptoms. Symptoms are also reported to appear at temperatures as low as 18 °C, but disease development is slowed; below that temperature, infections do not develop. Excessive water also promotes disease development by providing a more optimal environment for the pathogen, and has been shown to be a key factor in augmenting disease outbreak in fields with sprinkler irrigation\n\nThe degree of nitrogen fertilization is highly correlated to robust disease development: it has been shown that sugar beets supplied with excessive or adequate nitrogen are more diseased than sugarbeets with sub-optimal nitrogen levels. This is a paradox for farmers because, while increased nitrogen fertilization does increase sugar yield in non-infected sugarbeets, it also increases the severity of the disease if infection takes place. Thus, depending on the severity of infection, yield may go down with increased fertilizer use.\n\nThe spacing between plants also impacts the degree of infection: greater in-row spacing results in more diseased roots. This may be due to the fact that greater spacing promotes faster growth, and hence greater probability of cracks in the crown, or because of the increased amount of nitrogen available per plant.\n\nSince the pathogen has multiple hosts, it is important for farmers to be wary of other plants in the surrounding area. It is possible for the pathogen to survive in weedy hosts, and can infect injured carrots, potato, sweet potato, tomato, radish, squash, and cucumber. Hence, the presence of these plants may increase the supply of inoculum.\n\nIf the pathogen is cultured in a lab, it can grow on Miller and Schroth media, can use sucrose to make reducing sugars, and can use either lactose, methyl alpha-glucoside, inulin or raffinose to make acids. It is also capable of surviving in culture medium sodium levels of up to 7–9%, and in temperatures as high as 39 °C.\n\nSince the bacteria cannot survive in seeds, the best way to prevent the disease is to ensure that vegetatively propagated plant material are clean of infection, such that the bacterium does not enter the soil. However, if the bacteria is already present, there are some methods that can be used to lessen the infection.\n\nBecause the bacteria readily enter the plant through wounds, management practices that decrease injury to the plants are important to control the spread of the disease. Cultivation is not recommended, as the machinery can become contaminated and physically spread the bacteria around the soil. Accidental leaf tearing or root scarring can also occur depending on the size of the crop, allowing the bacteria to enter more individual plants. If hilling the beets, great care must be taken to avoid getting soil into the crown, because the pathogen is soil-borne and this could expose the plant to more bacteria, thus increasing the risk of infection.\n\nWhile most bacteria are motile and can swim, they cannot move very far due to their small size. However, they can be carried along by water, and a significant movement of \"Pectobacterium\" can be attributed to being carried downstream from irrigation and rainwater. To control the spread of the disease, limiting irrigation is another strategy. The bacteria also flourishes in wet conditions, so limiting excess water can control both the spread and severity of the disease.\n\nIncreased in-row spacing also causes more severe disease. In an infected field, yield decreased linearly when spacing was greater than 15 cm (6 in), so a spacing of 6 inches or less is recommended.\n\nThe bacteria can also utilize nitrogen fertilizer to accelerate their growth, thus limiting or eliminating the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied will lessen the disease severity. For example, when fertilizer was applied to an infected field the infection rate per root increased from 11% (with no added nitrogen) to 36% (with 336 kg nitrogen/hectare), and sugar yields decreased.\n\nThe bacteria can survive in the rhizosphere of other crops such as tomato, carrots, sweet potato, radish, and squash as well as weed plants like lupin and pigweed, so it is very hard to get rid of it completely. When it is known that the bacterium is present in the soil, planting resistant varieties can be the best defense against the disease. Many available beet cultivars are resistant to \"Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\", and some examples are provided in the corresponding table. A comprehensive list is maintained by the USDA on the Germplasm Resources Information Network.\nEven though some genes associated with root defense response have been identified, the specific mechanism of resistance is unknown, and it is currently being researched.\n\nSome bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, have been used as effective controls of bacterial diseases in laboratory experiments. This relatively new technology is a promising control method that is currently being researched. Bacteriophages are extremely host-specific, which makes them environmentally sound as they will not destroy other, beneficial soil microorganisms. Some bacteriophages identified as effective controls of \"Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"betavasculorum\" are the strains ΦEcc2 ΦEcc3 ΦEcc9 ΦEcc14. When mixed with a fertilizer and applied to inoculated calla lily bulbs in a greenhouse, they reduced diseased tissue by 40 to 70%. ΦEcc3 appeared to be the most effective, reducing the percent of diseased plants from 30 to 5% in one trial, to 50 to 15% in a second trial. They have also been used successfully to reduce rotting in lettuce caused by \"Pectobacterium carotovorum\" subsp. \"carotovorum\", a different bacterial species closely related to the one that causes beet vascular necrosis.\n\nWhile it is more difficult to apply bacteriophages in a field setting, it is not impossible, and laboratory and greenhouse trials are showing bacteriophages to potentially be a very effective control mechanism. However, there are a few obstacles to surmount before field trials can begin. A large problem is that they are damaged by UV light, so applying the phage mixture during the evening will help promote its viability. Also, providing the phages with susceptible non-pathogenic bacteria to replicate with can ensure there is adequate persistence until the bacteriophages can spread to the targeted bacteria. The bacteriophages are unable to kill all the bacteria, because they need a dense population of bacteria in order to effectively infect and spread, so while the phages were able to decrease the number of diseased plants by up to 35%, around 2,000 Colony Forming Units per milliliter (an estimate of living bacteria cells) were able to survive the treatment. Lastly, the use of these bacteriophages places strong selection on the host bacteria, which causes a high probability of developing resistance to the attacking bacteriophage. Thus it is recommended that multiple strains of the bacteriophage be used in each application so the bacteria do not have a chance to develop resistance to any one strain.\n\nThe disease was first identified in the western states of, California, Washington, Texas, Arizona and Idaho in the 1970s and initially led to substantial yield losses in those areas. \"Erwinia caratovara\" subsp \"betavascularum\" was not discovered in Montana until 1998. When it first appeared, beet vascular necrosis caused individual farm yield loss ranging from 5–70% in Montana's Bighorn Valley. Today, yield losses from the disease are generally infrequent and patchy as most producers plant resistant varieties. Infection rate is generally low if resistant cultivars are chosen; however, warmer and wetter conditions can lead to higher than normal instance of disease\n\nIf infection does occur, bacterial root rots can not only cause economic losses in the field, but also can in storage and processing as well. In processing plants, rotten roots complicate slicing and the bacterially-produced slime can clog filters. This is especially problematic with late-infected beets which are generally harvested and processed along with healthy beets. The disease can also lower sugar-content which greatly reduces the quality\n"}

It is also called the zero or empty type, and is sometimes denoted with falsum (⊥).\n\nA function whose return type is bottom cannot return any value. In the Curry–Howard correspondence, the bottom type corresponds to falsity.\n\nIn subtyping systems, the bottom type is the subtype of all types. (However, the converse is not true—a subtype of all types is not necessarily the bottom type.) It is used to represent the return type of a function that does not return a value: for instance, one which loops forever, signals an exception, or exits.\n\nBecause the bottom type is used to indicate the lack of a normal return, it typically has no values. It contrasts with the top type, which spans all possible values in a system, and a unit type, which has exactly one value.\n\nThe bottom type is frequently used for the following purposes:\n\nIn \"Bounded Quantification with Bottom\", Pierce says that \"Bot\" has many uses:\n\n\nMost commonly used languages don't have a way to explicitly denote the empty type. There are a few notable exceptions.\n\nHaskell does not support empty data types. However, in GHC, there is a flag codice_3 to allow the definition codice_4 (with no constructors). The type codice_5 is not quite empty, as it contains non-terminating programs and the codice_6 constant. The codice_6 constant is often used when you want something to have the empty type, because codice_6 matches any type (so is kind of a \"subtype\" of all types), and attempting to evaluate codice_6 will cause the program to abort, therefore it never returns an answer.\n\nIn Common Lisp the symbol codice_10, amongst its other uses, is also the name of a type that has no values. It is the complement of codice_11 which is the top type. The type named codice_10 is sometimes confused with the type named codice_13, which has one value, namely the symbol codice_10 itself.\n\nIn Scala, the bottom type is denoted as codice_15. Besides its use for functions that just throw exceptions or otherwise don't return normally, it's also used for covariant parameterized types. For example, Scala's List is a covariant type constructor, so codice_16 is a subtype of codice_17 for all types A. So Scala's codice_18, the object for marking the end of a list of any type, belongs to the type codice_16.\n\nIn Rust, the bottom type is denoted by codice_20. It is present in the type signature of functions guaranteed to never return, for example by calling codice_21 or looping forever.\n\nIn Ceylon, the bottom type is codice_15. It is comparable to codice_15 in Scala and represents the intersection of all other types as well as an empty set.\n\nIn TypeScript, the bottom type is codice_24.\n\n"}

Copulas are used to describe the dependence between random variables. Their name comes from the Latin for \"link\" or \"tie\", similar but unrelated to grammatical copulas in linguistics. Copulas have been used widely in quantitative finance to model and minimize tail risk and portfolio optimization applications.\n\nSklar's theorem states that any multivariate joint distribution can be written in terms of univariate marginal-distribution functions and a copula which describes the dependence structure between the variables.\n\nCopulas are popular in high-dimensional statistical applications as they allow one to easily model and estimate the distribution of random vectors by estimating marginals and copulae separately. There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.\n\nTwo-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name \"permutons\" and \"doubly-stochastic measures\".\n\nConsider a random vector formula_1. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal CDFs formula_2 are continuous functions. By applying the probability integral transform to each component, the random vector\nhas uniformly distributed marginals.\n\nThe copula of formula_1 is defined as the joint cumulative distribution function of formula_5:\n\nThe copula \"C\" contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of formula_1 whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions formula_8 contain all information on the marginal distributions.\n\nThe importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate pseudo-random samples from general classes of multivariate probability distributions. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample formula_5 from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as\nThe inverses formula_11 are unproblematic as the formula_8 were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:\n\nIn probabilistic terms, formula_14 is a \"d\"-dimensional copula if \"C\" is a joint cumulative distribution function of a \"d\"-dimensional random vector on the unit cube formula_15 with uniform marginals.\n\nIn analytic terms, formula_14 is a \"d\"-dimensional copula if\n\nFor instance, in the bivariate case, formula_22 is a bivariate copula if formula_23, formula_24 and formula_25 for all formula_26 and formula_27.\n\nSklar's theorem, named after Abe Sklar, provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.\nSklar's theorem states that every multivariate cumulative distribution function\nof a random vector formula_1 can be expressed in terms of its marginals formula_30 and\na copula formula_31. Indeed:\n\nIn case that the multivariate distribution has a density formula_33, and this is available, it holds further that\nwhere formula_35 is the density of the copula.\n\nThe theorem also states that, given formula_36, the copula is unique on formula_37, which is the cartesian product of the ranges of the marginal cdf's. This implies that the copula is unique if the marginals formula_8 are continuous.\n\nThe converse is also true: given a copula formula_39 and margins formula_40 then formula_41 defines a \"d\"-dimensional cumulative distribution function.\n\nThe Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem (after Maurice René Fréchet and Wassily Hoeffding) states that for any Copula formula_14 and any formula_43 the following bounds hold:\nThe function W is called lower Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as\nThe function M is called upper Fréchet–Hoeffding bound and is defined as\n\nThe upper bound is sharp: \"M\" is always a copula, it corresponds to comonotone random variables.\n\nThe lower bound is point-wise sharp, in the sense that for fixed u, there is a copula formula_47 such that formula_48. However, \"W\" is a copula only in two dimensions, in which case it corresponds to countermonotonic random variables.\n\nIn two dimensions, i.e. the bivariate case, the Fréchet–Hoeffding Theorem states\n\nSeveral families of copulas have been described.\n\nThe Gaussian copula is a distribution over the unit cube formula_15. It is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over formula_51 by using the probability integral transform.\n\nFor a given correlation matrix formula_52, the Gaussian copula with parameter matrix formula_53 can be written as\nwhere formula_55 is the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal and formula_56 is the joint cumulative distribution function of a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector zero and covariance matrix equal to the correlation matrix formula_53. While there is no simple analytical formula for the copula function, formula_58, it can be upper or lower bounded, and approximated using numerical integration. The density can be written as\nwhere formula_60 is the identity matrix.\n\nArchimedean copulas are an associative class of copulas. Most common Archimedean copulas admit an explicit formula, something not possible for instance for the Gaussian copula.\nIn practice, Archimedean copulas are popular because they allow modeling dependence in arbitrarily high dimensions with only one parameter, governing the strength of dependence.\n\nA copula C is called Archimedean if it admits the representation\n\nwhere formula_62 is a continuous, strictly decreasing and convex function such that formula_63. formula_64 is a parameter within some parameter space formula_65. formula_66 is the so-called generator function and formula_67 is its pseudo-inverse defined by\n\nMoreover, the above formula for C yields a copula for formula_69 if and only if formula_69 is d-monotone on formula_71.\nThat is, if it is formula_72 times differentiable and the derivatives satisfy\n\nfor all formula_74 and formula_75 and formula_76 is nonincreasing and convex.\n\nThe following tables highlight the most prominent bivariate Archimedean copulas, with their corresponding generator. Note that not all of them are completely monotone, i.e. \"d\"-monotone for all formula_77 or \"d\"-monotone for certain formula_78 only.\n\nIn statistical applications, many problems can be formulated in the following way. One is interested in the expectation of a response function formula_79 applied to some random vector formula_80. If we denote the cdf of this random vector with formula_36, the quantity of interest can thus be written as\n\nIf formula_36 is given by a copula model, i.e.,\n\nthis expectation can be rewritten as\n\nIn case the copula C is absolutely continuous, i.e. C has a density c, this equation can be written as\n\nand if each marginal distribution has the density formula_87 it holds further that\n\nIf copula and margins are known (or if they have been estimated), this expectation can be approximated through the following Monte Carlo algorithm:\n\nWhen studying multivariate data, one might want to investigate the underlying copula. Suppose we have observations\nfrom a random vector formula_1 with continuous margins. The corresponding \"true\" copula observations would be\nHowever, the marginal distribution functions formula_8 are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions\ninstead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as\nThe corresponding empirical copula is then defined as\nThe components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as formula_101, where formula_102 is the rank of the observation formula_103:\nTherefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.\n\nIn quantitative finance copulas are applied to risk management, to portfolio management and optimization, and to derivatives pricing.\n\nFor the former, copulas are used to perform stress-tests and robustness checks that are especially important during \"downside/crisis/panic regimes\" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007–2008). The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on pools of loans or bonds.\n\nDuring a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a flight-to-quality effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy. For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.\n\nCopulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the marginals and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to herd their trading behaviour and decisions. (See also agent-based computational economics, where price is treated as an emergent phenomenon, resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)\n\nThe users of the formula have been criticized for creating \"evaluation cultures\" that continued to use simple copulæ despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose. Thus, previously, scalable copula models for large dimensions only allowed the modelling of elliptical dependence structures (i.e., Gaussian and Student-t copulas) that do not allow for correlation asymmetries where correlations differ on the upside or downside regimes. However, the recent development of vine copulas (also known as pair copulas) enables the flexible modelling of the dependence structure for portfolios of large dimensions.\nThe Clayton canonical vine copula allows for the occurrence of extreme downside events and has been successfully applied in portfolio optimization and risk management applications. The model is able to reduce the effects of extreme downside correlations and produces improved statistical and economic performance compared to scalable elliptical dependence copulas such as the Gaussian and Student-t copula.\n\nOther models developed for risk management applications are panic copulas that are glued with market estimates of the marginal distributions to analyze the effects of panic regimes on the portfolio profit and loss distribution. Panic copulas are created by Monte Carlo simulation, mixed with a re-weighting of the probability of each scenario.\n\nAs regards derivatives pricing, dependence modelling with copula functions is widely used in applications of financial risk assessment and actuarial analysis – for example in the pricing of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Some believe the methodology of applying the Gaussian copula to credit derivatives to be one of the reasons behind the global financial crisis of 2008–2009; see .\n\nDespite this perception, there are documented attempts within the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the limitations of the Gaussian copula and of copula functions more generally, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics. The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix. This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns. Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of extreme events. There have been attempts to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations.\n\nAdditional to CDOs, Copulas have been applied to other asset classes as a flexible tool in analyzing multi-asset derivative products. The first such application outside credit was to use a copula to construct an basket implied volatility surface, taking into account the volatility smile of basket components. Copulas have since gained popularity in pricing and risk management of options on multi-assets in the presence of a volatility smile, in equity-, foreign exchange- and fixed income derivatives.\n\nRecently, copula functions have been successfully applied to the database formulation for the reliability analysis of highway bridges, and to various multivariate simulation studies in civil, mechanical and offshore engineering. Researchers are also trying these functions in field of transportation to understand interaction of individual driver behavior components which in totality shapes up the nature of an entire traffic flow.\n\nCopulas are being used for reliability analysis of complex systems of machine components with competing failure modes.\nCopulas are being used for warranty data analysis in which the tail dependence is analysed \n\nCopulas are used in modelling turbulent partially premixed combustion, which is common in practical combustors.\n\nCopula functions have been successfully applied to the analysis of neuronal dependencies\n\nCopulas have been extensively used in climate- and weather-related research.\n\nCopulas have been used to estimate the solar irradiance variability in spatial networks and temporally for single locations.\n\nLarge synthetic traces of vectors and stationary time series can be generated using empirical copula while preserving the entire dependence structure of small datasets. Such empirical traces are useful in various simulation-based performance studies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1726344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1726344", "title": "Demimonde", "text": "Demimonde\n\nDemi-monde refers to a group of people who live hedonistic lifestyles, usually in a flagrant and conspicuous manner. The term was commonly used in Europe from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, and contemporary use has an anachronistic character. Its connotations of pleasure-seeking often contrasted with wealth and ruling class behavior.\n\nThe term 'demi-monde' is French for \"half-world\". It derives from a comedy called \"Le Demi-Monde\", by Alexandre Dumas, fils, published in 1855.\n\nThe term was often used as one of disapprobation, the behavior of a person in the demimonde being contrary to more traditional or bourgeois values. Such behaviors often included drinking or drug use, gambling, high spending (particularly in pursuit of fashion, as through clothing as well as servants and houses), and sexual promiscuity. The term \"demimondaine\" referred to a woman who embodied these qualities; later it became a euphemism for a courtesan or prostitute.\n\nAs the twentieth century dawned, changing social mores resulted in the demarginalization of the demimonde. Women's suffrage and the flapper movements resulted in the label \"demimondaine\" becoming obsolete. The term commonly used to refer to the class that became 'starving artists'.\n\nExternally, the defining aspects of the demimonde were an extravagant lifestyle of fine food and clothes, often surpassing that of other wealthy women of their day with a steady income of cash and gifts from their various lovers. Internally, their lifestyle was an eclectic mixture of sharp business acumen, social skills, and hedonism. Intelligent demimondaines, like the fictional Gigi's grandmother, would invest their wealth for the day when their beauty faded. Others ended up penniless and starving when age took its toll on their beauty, unless they managed to marry.\n\nA famous beauty was Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, who came to Paris in the 1850s with very little money of her own and soon became mistress of Napoleon III; after that relationship ended she moved on to other wealthy men in government, finance and European royalty. She was one of the most aristocratic and exclusive of the demimondaines—reputed to have charged a member of the British aristocracy one million francs for 12 hours in her company. \n\nAnother woman who doubtless influenced later images of the demimondaine was the dancer and adventuress Lola Montez, though she died before the term came into general use.\n\nThe actress Sarah Bernhardt was the illegitimate child of a courtesan; in her day all actresses were generally considered demimondaines. Her many lovers and extravagant lifestyle fit the type, though her genuine successes as an artist and innovator eventually gained her a kind of public esteem most demimondaines never achieved.\n\nDescriptions of the demimonde can be found in \"Vanity Fair\" (1848), a novel which satirizes nineteenth century society, written by William Makepeace Thackeray. Although it does not mention the terms 'demimonde' and 'demimondaine' (they were coined later), the terms were later used by reviewers and other authors in reference to three characters in it. Lady Crackenbury and Mrs. Washington White are demimonde characters, both of whom Captain Rawdon Crawley lusts after in his younger days. Becky Sharp is perceived as a demimondaine before she is presented at court, and then becomes one when she travels through Europe after her husband abandons her.\n\nPossibly the most famous portrayal of the demimonde, albeit from before the word was coined, is in Verdi's opera \"La traviata\" (1853). The opera, in turn, was inspired by Alexandre Dumas the younger's \"La Dame aux Camélias;\" Marguerite Gautier, the heroine of the book and subsequent play, was based on Marie Duplessis, 1840s Paris courtesan and mistress to a number of prominent men, including Dumas.\n\nIn writing his 1924 play \"Easy Virtue\", Noël Coward stated his object was to present a comedy in the structure of a tragedy \"to compare the déclassée woman of to-day with the more flamboyant demi-mondaine of the 1890s.\"\n\nColette's \"Gigi\" (1944) also describes the demimonde and their lifestyle. Gigi is schooled from childhood to be a kept woman, to stifle her feelings in return for a life of ease. \"We never marry in our family\", says Gigi's mother. But Gigi finds herself a misfit in the demimonde of Paris in the 'Gay Nineties', as she desires true romance with Gaston.\n\nIn \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\" (1976) the character Lola Devereaux is labeled a demimondaine by the character Sigmund Freud.\n\nIn Henryk Sienkiewicz's \"Without Dogma\" (1891), the \"demimonde\" refers to the affluent, pleasure-seeking portion of society, unbound by morals, religion or tradition, and is loosely analogous to the \"Jet Set\" of modern times.\n\nIn Marcel Proust's \"Swann's Way\" (1913), Odette de Crécy is described as a demimondaine. \n\nFrancoise Sagan, in her novel \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1954), uses the term 'demimondaine' to refer to the character Elsa, a young, stunningly attractive woman who leverages her appearance into support by wealthy men, which allows her entrance into the social-world of the upper classes.\n\nThe high society men in Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor's novella \"The Old Forest\" (from the story collection of the same name, 1985) use \"demimonde\" to refer to a group of \"adventurous\" and intelligent young women in 1937 Memphis, Tennessee; in the story, it is common for the men to continue courting such \"demimondames\" right up until the time they are married to high society women.\n\nThe term appears repeatedly in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\".\n\nIn Kim Stanley Robinson's \"Mars trilogy\" (1990s), the \"demimonde\" refers to a semi-tolerated, \"off the net\" society of commerce and education.\n\n\n\n"}

This has been provided by Article 246, which has demarcated the legislative jurisdiction of the parliament and the state assemblies by outlining the different subjects under List I for the Union, List II for the State, and List III for both, as given in the seventh schedule to the Indian Constitution. As a consequence, conflicts of jurisdiction arise due to the fact there exist separate lists for the Union and the State to legislate upon. It often happens that strict constitutional boundaries are transgressed in legislation, inviting judicial review of the said bill/act.\n\nThe enactment of legislation is a function of the legislative power. In order to decide whether particular legislation is unconstitutional for breaching the constitutional limitations of distribution of powers, the Court examines the enactment with some strictness. The legislature can only make laws within its legislative competence. The legislative competence may be limited by specific List entries, or be restricted by other constitutional limitations and prohibitions. It cannot over-step the area of its legislative capability. A simple rule is followed in this regard, which is to find out if the legislating body had the power to legislate directly. If not, then the legislature cannot legislate indirectly. What it cannot do directly, it cannot attempt to do indirectly. Therefore, the substance of the legislation must be articulated for the purpose of determining whether what it enacted, it could really do. \n\nThe question of colourable legislation was fully discussed by the Supreme Court in K.C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v. Orissa, a decision which has been treated as settling the law on the subject. This ruling was confirmed in the Supreme Court decision of Sonapur Tea Co. v. Deputy Commissioner.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52162600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52162600", "title": "Ecological civilization", "text": "Ecological civilization\n\nEcological civilization is the final goal of social and environmental reform within a given society. It implies that the changes required in response to global climate disruption and social injustices are so extensive as to represent another form of human civilization, one based on ecological principles. Broadly construed, ecological civilization involves a synthesis of economic, educational, political, agricultural, and other societal reforms toward sustainability. \n\nAlthough the term was first coined in the 1980s, it did not see widespread use until 2007, when “ecological civilization” became an explicit goal of the Communist Party of China (CPC). In April 2014, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and the International Ecological Safety Collaborative Organization founded a sub-committee on ecological civilization. Proponents of ecological civilization agree with Pope Francis who writes, \"We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.\" As such, ecological civilization emphasizes the need for major environmental and social reforms that are both long-term and systemic in orientation.\n\nIn 1984, former Soviet Union environment experts proposed the term “Ecological Culture” (экологической культуры) in an article entitled “Ways of Fostering Ecological Culture in Individuals under the Conditions of Mature Socialism\" which was published in \"Scientific Communism\", Moscow, vol. 2. A summary of this article was published in the Chinese newspaper the Guangming Daily, where the notion of ecological culture was translated into Chinese as 生态文明 (shēngtài wénmíng), or ecological civilization.\n\nTwo years later, the concept of ecological civilization was picked up in China, and was first used by Ye Qianji (1909–2017), an agricultural economist, in 1987. Professor Ye defined ecological civilization by drawing from the ecological sciences and environmental philosophy.\n\nThe first time the phrase “ecological civilization” was used as a technical term in an English-language book was in 1995. Roy Morrison, an environmentalist, coined the phrase in his book \"Ecological Democracy\", writing that “An ecological civilization is based on diverse lifeways sustaining linked natural and social ecologies.”\n\nThe term is found more extensively in Chinese discussions beginning in 2007. In 2012, the Communist Party of China (CPC) included the goal of achieving an ecological civilization in its constitution, and it also featured in its five-year plan. In the Chinese context, the term generally presupposes the framework of a “constructive postmodernism,” as opposed to an extension of modernist practices or a “deconstructive postmodernism,” which stems from the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida.\n\nBoth “ecological civilization” and “constructive postmodernism” have been associated with the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead. David Ray Griffin, a process philosopher and professor at Claremont School of Theology, first used the term “constructive postmodernism” in his 1989 book, \"Varieties of Postmodern Theology\".\n\nThe largest international conference held on the theme “ecological civilization” (\"Seizing an Alternative: Toward an Ecological Civilization\") took place at Pomona College in June 2015, bringing together roughly 2,000 participants from around the world and featuring such leaders in the environmental movement as Bill McKibben, Vandana Shiva, John B. Cobb, Jr., Wes Jackson, and Sheri Liao.\n\nSince 2015, the Chinese discussion of ecological civilization is increasingly associated with an “organic” form of Marxism. “Organic Marxism” was first used by Philip Clayton and Justin Heinzekehr in their 2014 book, \"Organic Marxism: An Alternative to Capitalism and Ecological Catastrophe\". The book, which was translated into Chinese and published by the People’s Press in 2015, describes ecological civilization as an orienting goal for the global ecological movement.\n\nA defence of ecological civilization as the ultimate goal of humanity, has been mounted by Arran Gare in\n\"The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A Manifesto for the Future\", which was published in 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "9737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9737", "title": "Eugenics", "text": "Eugenics\n\nEugenics (; from Greek εὐγενής \"eugenes\" 'well-born' from εὖ \"eu\", 'good, well' and γένος \"genos\", 'race, stock, kin') is a set of beliefs and practices that aims at improving the genetic quality of a human population. The exact definition of \"eugenics\" has been a matter of debate since the term was coined by Francis Galton in 1883. The concept predates this coinage, with Plato suggesting applying the principles of selective breeding to humans around 400 BCE.\n\nFrederick Osborn's 1937 journal article \"Development of a Eugenic Philosophy\" framed it as a social philosophy—that is, a philosophy with implications for social order. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of sexual reproduction among people with desired traits (positive eugenics), or reduced rates of sexual reproduction and sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits (negative eugenics).\n\nAlternatively, gene selection rather than \"people selection\" has recently been made possible through advances in genome editing, leading to what is sometimes called new eugenics, also known as neo-eugenics, consumer eugenics, or liberal eugenics.\n\nWhile eugenic principles have been practiced as far back in world history as ancient Greece, the modern history of eugenics began in the early 20th century when a popular eugenics movement emerged in the United Kingdom and spread to many countries including the United States, Canada and most European countries. In this period, eugenic ideas were espoused across the political spectrum. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies with the intent to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both \"positive\" measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly \"fit\" to reproduce, and \"negative\" measures such as marriage prohibitions and forced sterilization of people deemed unfit for reproduction. People deemed unfit to reproduce often included people with mental or physical disabilities, people who scored in the low ranges of different IQ tests, criminals and deviants, and members of disfavored minority groups. The eugenics movement became negatively associated with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust when many of the defendants at the Nuremberg trials attempted to justify their human rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the Nazi eugenics programs and the U.S. eugenics programs. In the decades following World War II, with the institution of human rights, many countries gradually began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries, among them the United States and Sweden, continued to carry out forced sterilizations.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, when new assisted reproductive technology procedures became available such as gestational surrogacy (available since 1985), preimplantation genetic diagnosis (available since 1989), and cytoplasmic transfer (first performed in 1996), fear has emerged about a possible revival of eugenics.\n\nA major criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether \"negative\" or \"positive\" policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, negative eugenics in particular is considered by many to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of genetic diversity, resulting in inbreeding depression due to lower genetic variation.\n\nThe concept of positive eugenics to produce better human beings has existed at least since Plato suggested selective mating to produce a guardian class. In Sparta, every Spartan child was inspected by the council of elders, the Gerousia, which determined if the child was fit to live or not. In the early years of ancient Rome, a Roman father was obliged by law to immediately kill his child if they were physically disabled. Among the ancient Germanic tribes, people who were cowardly, unwarlike or \"stained with abominable vices\" were put to death, usually by being drowned in swamps.\nThe first formal negative eugenics, that is a legal provision against the birth of allegedly inferior human beings, was promulgated in Western European culture by the Christian Council of Agde in 506, which forbade marriage between cousins.\n\nThis idea was also promoted by William Goodell (1829–1894) who advocated the castration and spaying of the insane.\n\nThe idea of a modern project of improving the human population through a statistical understanding of heredity used to encourage good breeding was originally developed by Francis Galton and, initially, was closely linked to Darwinism and his theory of natural selection. Galton had read his half-cousin Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which sought to explain the development of plant and animal species, and desired to apply it to humans. Based on his biographical studies, Galton believed that desirable human qualities were hereditary traits, though Darwin strongly disagreed with this elaboration of his theory. In 1883, one year after Darwin's death, Galton gave his research a name: \"eugenics\". With the introduction of genetics, eugenics became associated with genetic determinism, the belief that human character is entirely or in the majority caused by genes, unaffected by education or living conditions. Many of the early geneticists were not Darwinians, and evolution theory was not needed for eugenics policies based on genetic determinism. Throughout its recent history, eugenics has remained controversial.\n\nEugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities and received funding from many sources. Organizations were formed to win public support and sway opinion towards responsible eugenic values in parenthood, including the British Eugenics Education Society of 1907 and the American Eugenics Society of 1921. Both sought support from leading clergymen and modified their message to meet religious ideals. In 1909 the Anglican clergymen William Inge and James Peile both wrote for the British Eugenics Education Society. Inge was an invited speaker at the 1921 International Eugenics Conference, which was also endorsed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York Patrick Joseph Hayes.\n\nThree International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenists with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York City. Eugenic policies were first implemented in the early 1900s in the United States. It also took root in France, Germany, and Great Britain. Later, in the 1920s and 1930s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in other countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Sweden.\n\nIn addition to being practiced in a number of countries, eugenics was internationally organized through the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations. Its scientific aspects were carried on through research bodies such as the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, the Cold Spring Harbour Carnegie Institution for Experimental Evolution, and the Eugenics Record Office. Politically, the movement advocated measures such as sterilization laws. In its moral dimension, eugenics rejected the doctrine that all human beings are born equal and redefined moral worth purely in terms of genetic fitness. Its racist elements included pursuit of a pure \"Nordic race\" or \"Aryan\" genetic pool and the eventual elimination of \"unfit\" races.\n\nEarly critics of the philosophy of eugenics included the American sociologist Lester Frank Ward, the English writer G. K. Chesterton, the German-American anthropologist Franz Boas, who argued that advocates of eugenics greatly over-estimate the influence of biology, and Scottish tuberculosis pioneer and author Halliday Sutherland. Ward's 1913 article \"Eugenics, Euthenics, and Eudemics\", Chesterton's 1917 book \"\", and Boas' 1916 article \"\" (published in \"The Scientific Monthly\") were all harshly critical of the rapidly growing movement. Sutherland identified eugenists as a major obstacle to the eradication and cure of tuberculosis in his 1917 address \"Consumption: Its Cause and Cure\", and criticism of eugenists and Neo-Malthusians in his 1921 book \"Birth Control\" led to a writ for libel from the eugenist Marie Stopes. Several biologists were also antagonistic to the eugenics movement, including Lancelot Hogben. Other biologists such as J. B. S. Haldane and R. A. Fisher expressed skepticism in the belief that sterilization of \"defectives\" would lead to the disappearance of undesirable genetic traits.\n\nAmong institutions, the Catholic Church was an opponent of state-enforced sterilizations. Attempts by the Eugenics Education Society to persuade the British government to legalize voluntary sterilization were opposed by Catholics and by the Labour Party. The American Eugenics Society initially gained some Catholic supporters, but Catholic support declined following the 1930 papal encyclical \"Casti connubii\". In this, Pope Pius XI explicitly condemned sterilization laws: \"Public magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects; therefore, where no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, they can never directly harm, or tamper with the integrity of the body, either for the reasons of eugenics or for any other reason.\"\n\nAs a social movement, eugenics reached its greatest popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, when it was practiced around the world and promoted by governments, institutions, and influential individuals. Many countries enacted various eugenics policies, including: genetic screenings, birth control, promoting differential birth rates, marriage restrictions, segregation (both racial segregation and sequestering the mentally ill), compulsory sterilization, forced abortions or forced pregnancies, ultimately culminating in genocide.\n\nThe scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst Rüdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany. Adolf Hitler had praised and incorporated eugenic ideas in \"Mein Kampf\" in 1925 and emulated eugenic legislation for the sterilization of \"defectives\" that had been pioneered in the United States once he took power. Some common early 20th century eugenics methods involved identifying and classifying individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, deaf, developmentally disabled, promiscuous women, homosexuals, and racial groups (such as the Roma and Jews in Nazi Germany) as \"degenerate\" or \"unfit\", and therefore led to segregation, institutionalization, sterilization, euthanasia, and even mass murder. The Nazi practice of euthanasia was carried out on hospital patients in the Aktion T4 centers such as Hartheim Castle.\n\nBy the end of World War II, many discriminatory eugenics laws were abandoned, having become associated with Nazi Germany. H. G. Wells, who had called for \"the sterilization of failures\" in 1904, stated in his 1940 book \"The Rights of Man: Or What are we fighting for?\" that among the human rights, which he believed should be available to all people, was \"a prohibition on mutilation, sterilization, torture, and any bodily punishment\". After World War II, the practice of \"imposing measures intended to prevent births within [a national, ethnical, racial or religious] group\" fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also proclaims \"the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at selection of persons\". In spite of the decline in discriminatory eugenics laws, some government mandated sterilizations continued into the 21st century. During the ten years President Alberto Fujimori led Peru from 1990 to 2000, 2,000 persons were allegedly involuntarily sterilized. China maintained its one-child policy until 2015 as well as a suite of other eugenics based legislation to reduce population size and manage fertility rates of different populations. In 2007 the United Nations reported coercive sterilizations and hysterectomies in Uzbekistan. During the years 2005 to 2013, nearly one-third of the 144 California prison inmates who were sterilized did not give lawful consent to the operation.\n\nDevelopments in genetic, genomic, and reproductive technologies at the end of the 20th century have raised numerous questions regarding the ethical status of eugenics, effectively creating a resurgence of interest in the subject.\nSome, such as UC Berkeley sociologist Troy Duster, claim that modern genetics is a back door to eugenics. This view is shared by White House Assistant Director for Forensic Sciences, Tania Simoncelli, who stated in a 2003 publication by the Population and Development Program at Hampshire College that advances in pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) are moving society to a \"new era of eugenics\", and that, unlike the Nazi eugenics, modern eugenics is consumer driven and market based, \"where children are increasingly regarded as made-to-order consumer products\". In a 2006 newspaper article, Richard Dawkins said that discussion regarding eugenics was inhibited by the shadow of Nazi misuse, to the extent that some scientists would not admit that breeding humans for certain abilities is at all possible. He believes that it is not physically different from breeding domestic animals for traits such as speed or herding skill. Dawkins felt that enough time had elapsed to at least ask just what the ethical differences were between breeding for ability versus training athletes or forcing children to take music lessons, though he could think of persuasive reasons to draw the distinction.\n\nLee Kuan Yew, the Founding Father of Singapore, started promoting eugenics as early as 1983.\n\nIn October 2015, the United Nations' International Bioethics Committee wrote that the ethical problems of human genetic engineering should not be confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. However, it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new forms of discrimination and stigmatization for those who do not want, or cannot afford, the technology.\n\nTranshumanism is often associated with eugenics, although most transhumanists holding similar views nonetheless distance themselves from the term \"eugenics\" (preferring \"germinal choice\" or \"reprogenetics\") to avoid having their position confused with the discredited theories and practices of early-20th-century eugenic movements.\n\nPrenatal screening can be considered a form of contemporary eugenics because it may lead to abortions of children with undesirable traits.\n\nThe term eugenics and its modern field of study were first formulated by Francis Galton in 1883, drawing on the recent work of his half-cousin Charles Darwin. Galton published his observations and conclusions in his book \"Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development\".\n\nThe origins of the concept began with certain interpretations of Mendelian inheritance and the theories of August Weismann. The word \"eugenics\" is derived from the Greek word \"eu\" (\"good\" or \"well\") and the suffix \"-genēs\" (\"born\"), and was coined by Galton in 1883 to replace the word \"stirpiculture\", which he had used previously but which had come to be mocked due to its perceived sexual overtones. Galton defined eugenics as \"the study of all agencies under human control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations\".\n\nHistorically, the term eugenics has referred to everything from prenatal care for mothers to forced sterilization and euthanasia. To population geneticists, the term has included the avoidance of inbreeding without altering allele frequencies; for example, J. B. S. Haldane wrote that \"the motor bus, by breaking up inbred village communities, was a powerful eugenic agent.\" Debate as to what exactly counts as eugenics continues today.\n\nEdwin Black, journalist and author of \"War Against the Weak\", claims eugenics is often deemed a pseudoscience because what is defined as a genetic improvement of a desired trait is often deemed a cultural choice rather than a matter that can be determined through objective scientific inquiry. The most disputed aspect of eugenics has been the definition of \"improvement\" of the human gene pool, such as what is a beneficial characteristic and what is a defect. Historically, this aspect of eugenics was tainted with scientific racism and pseudoscience.\n\nEarly eugenists were mostly concerned with factors of perceived intelligence that often correlated strongly with social class. Some of these early eugenists include Karl Pearson and Walter Weldon, who worked on this at the University College London.\n\nEugenics also had a place in medicine. In his lecture \"Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics\", Karl Pearson said that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine. He basically placed the two words as equivalents. He was supported in part by the fact that Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, also had medical training.\n\nEugenic policies have been conceptually divided into two categories. Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, \"in vitro\" fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. The movie Gattaca provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. Negative eugenics aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally \"undesirable\". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and negative eugenics can be coercive; abortion for fit women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.\n\nJon Entine claims that eugenics simply means \"good genes\" and using it as synonym for genocide is an \"all-too-common distortion of the social history of genetics policy in the United States.\" According to Entine, eugenics developed out of the Progressive Era and not \"Hitler's twisted Final Solution\".\n\nAccording to Richard Lynn, eugenics may be divided into two main categories based on the ways in which the methods of eugenics can be applied.\n\nThe first major challenge to conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was made in 1915 by Thomas Hunt Morgan. He demonstrated the event of genetic mutation occurring outside of inheritance involving the discovery of the hatching of a fruit fly (\"Drosophila melanogaster\") with white eyes from a family with red eyes. Morgan claimed that this demonstrated that major genetic changes occurred outside of inheritance and that the concept of eugenics based upon genetic inheritance was not completely scientifically accurate. Additionally, Morgan criticized the view that subjective traits, such as intelligence and criminality, were caused by heredity because he believed that the definitions of these traits varied and that accurate work in genetics could only be done when the traits being studied were accurately defined. Despite Morgan's public rejection of eugenics, much of his genetic research was absorbed by eugenics.\n\nThe heterozygote test is used for the early detection of recessive hereditary diseases, allowing for couples to determine if they are at risk of passing genetic defects to a future child. The goal of the test is to estimate the likelihood of passing the hereditary disease to future descendants.\n\nRecessive traits can be severely reduced, but never eliminated unless the complete genetic makeup of all members of the pool was known, as aforementioned. As only very few undesirable traits, such as Huntington's disease, are dominant, it could be argued from certain perspectives that the practicality of \"eliminating\" traits is quite low.\n\nThere are examples of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of recessive diseases, although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Tay–Sachs, cystic fibrosis, Canavan's disease, and Gaucher's disease), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.\n\nPleiotropy occurs when one gene influences multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits, an example being phenylketonuria, which is a human disease that affects multiple systems but is caused by one gene defect. Andrzej Pękalski, from the University of Wrocław, argues that eugenics can cause harmful loss of genetic diversity if a eugenics program selects a pleiotropic gene that could possibly be associated with a positive trait. Pekalski uses the example of a coercive government eugenics program that prohibits people with myopia from breeding but has the unintended consequence of also selecting against high intelligence since the two go together.\n\nEugenic policies could also lead to loss of genetic diversity, in which case a culturally accepted \"improvement\" of the gene pool could very likely—as evidenced in numerous instances in isolated island populations —result in extinction due to increased vulnerability to disease, reduced ability to adapt to environmental change, and other factors both known and unknown. A long-term, species-wide eugenics plan might lead to a scenario similar to this because the elimination of traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity by definition.\n\nEdward M. Miller claims that, in any one generation, any realistic program should make only minor changes in a fraction of the gene pool, giving plenty of time to reverse direction if unintended consequences emerge, reducing the likelihood of the elimination of desirable genes. Miller also argues that any appreciable reduction in diversity is so far in the future that little concern is needed for now.\n\nWhile the science of genetics has increasingly provided means by which certain characteristics and conditions can be identified and understood, given the complexity of human genetics, culture, and psychology, at this point no agreed objective means of determining which traits might be ultimately desirable or undesirable. Some diseases such as sickle-cell disease and cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity to malaria and resistance to cholera when a single copy of the recessive allele is contained within the genotype of the individual. Reducing the instance of sickle-cell disease genes in Africa where malaria is a common and deadly disease could indeed have extremely negative net consequences.\n\nHowever, some genetic diseases cause people to consider some elements of eugenics.\n\nSocietal and political consequences of eugenics call for a place in the discussion on the ethics behind the eugenics movement. Many of the ethical concerns regarding eugenics arise from its controversial past, prompting a discussion on what place, if any, it should have in the future. Advances in science have changed eugenics. In the past, eugenics had more to do with sterilization and enforced reproduction laws. Now, in the age of a progressively mapped genome, embryos can be tested for susceptibility to disease, gender, and genetic defects, and alternative methods of reproduction such as in vitro fertilization are becoming more common. Therefore, eugenics is no longer \"ex post facto\" regulation of the living but instead preemptive action on the unborn.\n\nWith this change, however, there are ethical concerns which lack adequate attention, and which must be addressed before eugenic policies can be properly implemented in the future. Sterilized individuals, for example, could volunteer for the procedure, albeit under incentive or duress, or at least voice their opinion. The unborn fetus on which these new eugenic procedures are performed cannot speak out, as the fetus lacks the voice to consent or to express his or her opinion. Philosophers disagree about the proper framework for reasoning about such actions, which change the very identity and existence of future persons.\n\nA common criticism of eugenics is that \"it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical\". Some fear future \"eugenics wars\" as the worst-case scenario: the return of coercive state-sponsored genetic discrimination and human rights violations such as compulsory sterilization of persons with genetic defects, the killing of the institutionalized and, specifically, segregation and genocide of \"races\"\" \"perceived as inferior. Health law professor George Annas and technology law professor Lori Andrews are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-posthuman caste warfare.\n\nIn his 2003 book \"Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age\", environmental ethicist Bill McKibben argued at length against germinal choice technology and other advanced biotechnological strategies for human enhancement. He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to aging, maximum life span and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to \"improve\" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem meaningful in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples Ming China, Tokugawa Japan and the contemporary Amish.\n\nSome, for example Nathaniel C. Comfort from Johns Hopkins University, claim that the change from state-led reproductive-genetic decision-making to individual choice has moderated the worst abuses of eugenics by transferring the decision-making from the state to the patient and their family. Comfort suggests that \"the eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society; and the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic bio-medicine are too great for us to do otherwise.\" Others, such as bioethicist Stephen Wilkinson of Keele University and Honorary Research Fellow Eve Garrard at the University of Manchester, claim that some aspects of modern genetics can be classified as eugenics, but that this classification does not inherently make modern genetics immoral. In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that \"[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that PGD, and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they're wrong.\"\n\nIn their book published in 2000, \"From Chance to Choice: Genetics and Justice\", bioethicists Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels and Daniel Wikler argued that liberal societies have an obligation to encourage as wide an adoption of eugenic enhancement technologies as possible (so long as such policies do not infringe on individuals' reproductive rights or exert undue pressures on prospective parents to use these technologies) in order to maximize public health and minimize the inequalities that may result from both natural genetic endowments and unequal access to genetic enhancements.\n\nOriginal position, a hypothetical situation developed by American philosopher John Rawls, has been used as an argument for \"negative eugenics\".\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been discovered by Nick Laskin who coined the term \"fractional quantum mechanics\".\n\nStandard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the matrix mechanics, the Schrödinger equation and the Feynman path integral.\n\nThe Feynman path integral is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by Nick Laskin (1999) as a result of expanding the Feynman path integral, from the Brownian-like to the Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the Lévy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of quantum mechanics. If the Feynman path integral leads to the well known Schrödinger equation, then the path integral over Lévy trajectories leads to the fractional Schrödinger equation. The Lévy process is characterized\nby the Lévy index \"α\", 0 < \"α\" ≤ 2. At the special case when \"α\" = 2 the Lévy process becomes the process of Brownian motion. The fractional Schrödinger equation includes a space derivative of fractional order \"α\" instead of the second order (\"α\" = 2) space derivative in the standard Schrödinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation is a fractional differential equation in accordance with modern terminology. This is the key point to launch the term fractional Schrödinger equation and more general term \"fractional quantum mechanics\". As mentioned above, at \"α\" = 2 the Lévy motion becomes Brownian motion. Thus, fractional quantum mechanics includes standard quantum mechanics as a particular case at \"α\" = 2. The quantum-mechanical path integral over the Lévy paths at \"α\" = 2 becomes the well-known Feynman path integral and the fractional Schrödinger equation becomes the well-known Schrödinger equation.\n\nThe fractional Schrödinger equation discovered by Nick Laskin has the following form (see, Refs.[1,3,4])\n\nusing the standard definitions:\n\nFurther,\n\nHere, the wave functions in the position and momentum spaces; formula_3 and formula_4 are related each other by the 3-dimensional Fourier transforms:\n\nThe index \"α\" in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1 < \"α\" ≤ 2.\n\nThe effective mass of states in solid state systems can depend on the wave vector k, i.e. formally one considers m=m(k). Polariton Bose-Einstein condensate modes are examples of states in solid state systems with mass sensitive to variations and locally in k fractional quantum mechanics is experimentally feasible.\n\n\n\n\n"}

If the function input \"x\", and the values \"f\"(\"x\"), are real numbers, the graph is a two-dimensional graph, and, for a continuous function, is a curve. If the function input \"x\" is an ordered pair of real numbers, the graph is the collection of all pairs . These pairs can be identified with the ordered triples . For a continuous function the graph of such a function is a surface.\n\nThe concept of the graph of a function is generalized to the graph of a relation. \nTo test whether a graph of a relation represents a function of the first variable \"x\", one uses the vertical line test. To test whether a graph represents a function of the second variable \"y\", one uses the horizontal line test. If the function has an inverse, the graph of the inverse can be found by reflecting the graph of the original function over the line .\n\nIn science, engineering, technology, finance, and other areas, graphs are tools used for many purposes. In the simplest case one variable is plotted as a function of another, typically using rectangular axes; see \"Plot (graphics)\" for details.\n\nIn the modern foundations of mathematics, and, typically, in set theory, a function and its graph are the same thing. However, it is often useful to see functions as mappings, which consist not only of the relation between input and output, but also on which set is the domain, and which set is the co-domain. For example, to say that a function is onto (surjective) or not the co-domain should be taken into account. The graph of a function on its own doesn't determine the co-domain. It is common to use both words, function and graph of a function, since even if considered the same object, they indicate viewing it from a different angle.\n\nGiven a mapping formula_1, in other words a function formula_2 together with its domain formula_3 and co-domain formula_4, the graph of the mapping is the set \nwhich is a subset of formula_6. The graph of the function formula_2 is the same set formula_8, which is, in the abstract definition of a function, the same as formula_2 itself.\n\nThe graph of the function formula_10 defined by\nis the set the subset of formula_12\n\nFrom the graph, the domain formula_14 is recovered as the set of first component of each pair in the graph formula_15.\nSimilarly, the range can be recovered as formula_16.\nThe codomain formula_17, however, cannot be determined from the graph alone.\n\nThe graph of the cubic polynomial on the real line\n\nis\n\nIf this set is plotted on a Cartesian plane, the result is a curve (see figure).\n\nThe graph of the trigonometric function\n\nis\n\nIf this set is plotted on a three dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, the result is a surface (see figure).\n\nOftentimes it is helpful to show with the graph, the gradient of the function and several level curves. The level curves can be mapped on the function surface or can be projected on the bottom plane. The second figure shows such a drawing of the graph of the function:\n\nThe graph of a function is contained in a Cartesian product of sets. An X–Y plane is a cartesian product of two lines, called X and Y, while a cylinder is a cartesian product of a line and a circle, whose height, radius, and angle assign precise locations of the points. Fibre bundles are not Cartesian products, but appear to be up close. There is a corresponding notion of a graph on a fibre bundle called a section.\n\n\nSee List of graphing software\n\n"}
{"id": "2185562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2185562", "title": "Human branding", "text": "Human branding\n\nHuman branding or stigmatizing is the process which a mark, usually a symbol or ornamental pattern, is burned into the skin of a living person, with the intention that the resulting scar makes it permanent. This is performed using a hot or very cold branding iron. It therefore uses the physical techniques of livestock branding on a human, either with consent as a form of body modification; or under coercion, as a punishment or to identify an enslaved or otherwise oppressed person. It may also be practiced as a \"rite of passage\", e.g. within a tribe, or to signify membership of or acceptance into an organization.\n\nThe English verb to \"burn\", attested since the 12th century, is a combination of Old Norse \"brenna\" \"to burn, light\", and two originally distinct Old English verbs: \"bærnan\" \"to kindle\" (transitive) and \"beornan\" \"to be on fire\" (intransitive), both from the Proto-Germanic root \"bren(wanan)\", perhaps from a Proto-Indo-European root \"bhre-n-u\", from base root \"bhereu-\" \"to boil forth, well up.\" In Dutch, \"(ver)branden\" mean \"to burn\", \"brandmerk\" a branded mark; similarly, in German, \"Brandzeichen\" means \"a brand\" and \"brandmarken\", \"to brand\".\n\nSometimes, the word \"cauterize\" is used. This is known in English since 1541, and is derived via Medieval French \"cauteriser\" from Late Latin \"cauterizare\" \"to burn or brand with a hot iron\", itself from Greek καυτηριάζειν, \"kauteriazein\", from καυτήρ \"kauter\" \"burning or branding iron\", from καίειν \"kaiein\" \"to burn\". However \"cauterization\" is now generally understood to mean a medical process – specifically to stop bleeding.\n\nThe origin may be the ancient treatment of a slave (often without legal rights) as livestock.\n\nTo a slave owner it would be logical to mark such property just like cattle, more so since humans are more able to escape.\n\nIn criminal law, branding with a hot iron was a mode of punishment consisting of marking the subject as if goods or animals, sometimes concurrently with their reduction of status in life.\n\nBrand marks have also been used as a punishment for convicted criminals, combining physical punishment, as burns are very painful, with public humiliation (greatest if marked on a normally visible part of the body) which is here the more important intention, and with the imposition of an indelible criminal record.\nRobbers, like runaway slaves, were marked by the Romans with the letter F (\"fur\"); and the toilers in the mines, and convicts condemned to figure in gladiatorial shows, were branded on the forehead for identification. Under Constantine I the face was not permitted to be so disfigured, the branding being on the hand, arm or calf.\n\nThe Acts of Sharbil record it applied, amongst other tortures, to a Christian between the eyes and on the cheeks in Parthian Edessa at the time of the Roman Emperor Trajan on a judge's order for refusal to sacrifice.\n\nIn the 16th century, German Anabaptists were branded with a cross on their foreheads for refusing to recant their faith and join the Roman Catholic church.\n\nIn the North-American Puritan settlements of the 17th century, men and women sentenced for adultery were branded with an \"A\" letter on their chest, and for other crimes, such as \"D\" for drunkenness and \"B\" for blasphemy.\n\nThe mark in later times was also often chosen as a code for the crime (e.g. in Canadian military prisons D for Desertion, BC for Bad Character; most branded men were shipped off to a penal colony). Branding was used for a time by the Union Army during the American Civil War. Surgeon and Oxford English Dictionary contributor William Chester Minor was required to brand deserters at around the time of the Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nUntil 1832 in France, various offenses carried the additional infamy of being branded with a fleur de lis and galley-slaves could be branded GAL or, once the galleys were replaced by the \"bagnes\" on land, TF (\"travaux forcés\", 'forced' labor, i.e. hard labour) or TFP (\"travaux forcés à perpetuité\", hard labour for life). In most of the German-speaking states, however, branding people was unlawful. \n\nFollowing the Conspiracy of the Slaves of 1749 in Malta, some slaves were branded with the letter R (for \"ribelli\") on their forehead and condemned to the galleys for life.\n\nBranding tended to be abolished like other judicial mutilations (with notable exceptions, such as amputation under sharia law), sooner and more widely than flogging, caning, and similar corporal punishments, which normally aim 'only' at pain and at worst cause stripe scars, although the most severe lashings (not uncommon in penal colonies) in terms of dosage and instrument (such as the proverbial knout) can even turn out to cause death.\n\nIn Louisiana, there was a \"black code\", or \"Code Noir\", which allowed the cropping of ears, shoulder branding, and hamstringing, the cutting of tendons near the knee, as punishments for recaptured slaves. Slave owners used extreme punishments to stop flight, or escape. They would often brand the slaves' palms, shoulders, buttocks, or cheeks with a branding iron.\n\nBranding was sometimes used to mark recaptured runaway slaves to help the locals easily identify the runaway. Mr. Micajah Ricks, in Raleigh, North Carolina, was looking for his slave and described, \"I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her face, I tried to make the letter M.\"\n\nMost slave owners would use whipping as their main method, but at other times they would use branding to punish their slaves. Another testimony explains how a slave owner in Kentucky around 1848 was looking for his runaway slave. He described her having \"a brand mark on the breast something like L blotched.\" In South Carolina, there were many laws which permitted the punishments slaves would receive. When a slave ran away, if it was the first offense, the slave would receive no more than forty lashes. Then the second offense would be branding. The slave would have been marked with the letter R on their forehead signifying that they were a criminal, and a runaway.\n\nCeremonial Branding is an integral part of religious initiation in most Vaishnava sects. References to this practice can be traced in texts such as Narad Panchratra, Vaikhnasagama, Skanda Purana etc. This practice is still in vogue among Madhava sect Brahmins of Karnataka in India.\n\nThe punishment was adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, and the ancient law of England authorized the penalty. By the \nStatute of Vagabonds (1547) under King Edward VI, vagabonds and Gypsies were ordered to be branded with a large V on the breast, and brawlers with F for \"fraymaker\"; slaves who ran away were branded with S on the cheek or forehead. This law was repealed in England in 1550. From the time of Henry VII, branding was inflicted for all offences which received Benefit of clergy (branding of the thumbs was used around 1600 at Old Bailey to ensure that the accused who had successfully used the Benefit of Clergy defence, by reading a passage from the Bible, could not use it more than once), but it was abolished for such in 1822. In 1698 it was enacted that those convicted of petty theft or larceny, who were entitled to benefit of clergy, should be \"burnt in the most visible part of the left cheek, nearest the nose.\" This special ordinance was repealed in 1707. James Nayler, a Quaker who in the year 1655 was accused of claiming to be the Messiah, convicted of blasphemy in a highly publicized trial before the Second Protectorate Parliament and had his tongue bored through and his forehead branded B for \"blasphemer\".\n\nIn the Lancaster criminal court a branding iron is still preserved in the dock. It is a long bolt with a wooden handle at one end and an M (malefactor) at the other; close by are two iron loops for firmly securing the hands during the operation. The brander would, after examination, turn to the judge exclaiming \"A fair mark, my lord.\" Criminals were formerly ordered to hold up their hands before sentence to show if they had been previously convicted.\n\nIn the 18th century, cold branding or branding with cold irons became the mode of nominally inflicting the punishment on prisoners of higher rank. \"When Charles Moritz, a young German, visited England in 1782 he was much surprised at this custom, and in his diary mentioned the case of a clergyman who had fought a duel and killed his man in Hyde Park. Found guilty of manslaughter he was burnt in the hand, if that could be called burning which was done with a cold iron\" (Markham's \"Ancient Punishments of Northants\", 1886).\n\nSuch cases led to branding becoming obsolete, and it was abolished in 1829 except in the case of deserters from the army, who were marked with the letter D, not with hot irons but by tattooing with ink or gunpowder. Notoriously bad soldiers were also branded with BC (bad character). The British Mutiny Act of 1858 provided that the court-martial might, in addition to any other penalty, order deserters to be marked on the left side, 2 inches (5 cm) below the armpit, with the letter D, such letter to be not less than an inch long. In 1879 this was abolished.\n\nOffenders in Australia were subject to branding in accordance with British law. In 1826, in Hobart, Joseph Clarke was charged with manslaughter and ‘sentenced to be burnt in the hand’. In 1850, in New South Wales, deserter Daniel O’Neil was tattooed with the letter ‘D’. \n\nBranding in Russia was used quite extensively in the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. Over time, red hot iron brands were gradually replaced by tattoo boards; criminals were first branded on the forehead and cheeks, later on the back and arms. Branding was totally abolished in 1863.\n\nForced and enslaved prostitutes are often tattooed or branded with a mark of their owners. Women and girls being forced into prostitution would have their boss’s name or gang symbol inked or branded with hot iron on their skin. In some organizations involved with the trafficking of women and girls like the mafias nearly all prostitutes are marked. Some pimps and organisations use their name or well-known symbol, others are using secret signs.\n\nThe branding is both painful and humiliating for the prostitute, especially when done with a branding iron, and may be also a form of punishment and of psychological submission for the prostitutes.\n\nSome years ago the brands were usually small, only recognized by other pimps, sometimes hidden between the inner vaginal lips, though other instances show that pimps have no issue with larger more noticeable brands \n\n\nIn symbolic solidarity with Calf 269, protesters in Israel subjected themselves to branding on World Farm Animals Day (Gandhi's birthday): October 2, 2012.

It is also called the Socratic paradox. The phrase is not one that Socrates himself is ever recorded as saying.\n\nThis saying is also connected or conflated with the answer to a question Socrates (according to Xenophon) or Chaerephon (according to Plato) is said to have posed to the Pythia, the oracle of Delphi, in which the Oracle stated something to the effect of \"Socrates is the wisest.\"\n\nThe phrase, originally from Latin (\"'\"), is a possible paraphrase from a Greek text (see below). It is also quoted as \"'\" or \"\"\". It was later back-translated to Katharevousa Greek as \"\", [\"èn oîda óti\"] \"oudèn oîda\").\n\nThe saying, though widely attributed to Plato's Socrates in both ancient and modern times, actually occurs nowhere in Plato's works in this form. Two prominent Plato scholars have recently argued that the claim should not be attributed to Plato's Socrates.\n\nEvidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at \"Apology\" 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also \"Apology\" 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.\n\nIn \"Apology\", Plato relates that Socrates accounts for his seeming wiser than any other person because he does not imagine that he knows what he does not know.\n\n<br>[…] I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.\nThe context in which this passage occurs should be considered; Socrates having gone to a \"wise\" man, and having discussed with him, withdraws and thinks the above to himself. Socrates, since he denied any kind of knowledge, then tried to find someone wiser than himself among politicians, poets, and craftsmen. It appeared that politicians claimed wisdom without knowledge; poets could touch people with their words, but did not know their meaning; and craftsmen could claim knowledge only in specific and narrow fields. The interpretation of the Oracle's answer might be Socrates' awareness of his own ignorance.\n\nSocrates also deals with this phrase in Plato's dialogue \"Meno\" when he says:\n\n<br>[So now I do not know what virtue is; perhaps you knew before you contacted me, but now you are certainly like one who does not know.] (trans. G. M. A. Grube)\nHere, Socrates aims at the change of Meno's opinion, who was a firm believer in his own opinion and whose claim to knowledge Socrates had disproved.\n\nIt is essentially the question that begins \"post-Socratic\" Western philosophy. Socrates begins all wisdom with wondering, thus one must begin with admitting one's ignorance. After all, Socrates' dialectic method of teaching was based on that he as a teacher knew nothing, so he would derive knowledge from his students by dialogue.\n\nThere is also a passage by Diogenes Laertius in his work \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\" where he lists, among the things that Socrates used to say: \"\", or \"that he knew nothing except that he knew that very fact (i.e. that he knew nothing)\".\n\nAgain, closer to the quote, there is a passage in Plato's \"Apology\", where Socrates says that after discussing with someone he started thinking that:\n\nI am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.\n\"Socratic paradox\" may also refer to statements of Socrates that seem contrary to common sense, such as that \"no one desires evil\" (see Socratic paradoxes).\n\n"}

The levels concept is an intellectual framework for structuring reality. It arranges all material entities and all processes in the universe into a hierarchy based on how complex the entity's organization is. When arranged this way, each entity is three things at the same time: It is made up of parts from the previous level below. It is a whole in its own right. And it is a part of the whole that is on the next level above. Typical examples include life emerging from non-living substances, and consciousness emerging from nervous systems. \n\nThe main levels usually acknowledged are those of matter, life, mind, and society. These are called \"strata\" in Nicolai Hartmann's ontology. They can be further analyzed into more specific \"layers\", such as those of particles, atoms, molecules, and rocks forming the material stratum, or those of cells, organisms, populations, and ecosystems forming the life stratum.\n\nThe sequence of levels is often described as one of increasing complexity, although it is not clear whether this is always true: for example, parasitism emerges on pre-existing organisms, although parasites are often simpler than their originating forms.\n\nIdeas connected to integrative levels can be found in the works of both materialist philosophers, and anti-materialist ones.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51319", "title": "Intellectual history", "text": "Intellectual history\n\nIntellectual history refers to the historiography of ideas and thinkers. This history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by historians is parallel to the history of philosophy as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the history of ideas. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.\n\nIntellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term \"context\" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.\n\nIt is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of cultural history which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the \"intellectual\" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is Carlo Ginzburg's study of a 16th-century Italian miller, Menocchio, in his seminal work \"The Cheese and the Worms\".\n\nAlthough the field emerged from European disciplines of \"Kulturgeschichte\" and \"Geistesgeschichte\", the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a Global intellectual history that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the history of the book and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.\n\nIntellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the history of philosophy, the history of ideas, and in cultural history as practiced since Burckhardt or indeed since Voltaire. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to Francis Bacon’s call for what he termed a literary history in his The Advancement of Learning. In economics, John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself, and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the Keynesian revolution. However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as \"the history of ideas\" under the leadership of Arthur Lovejoy, the founder of the Journal of the History of Ideas. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of \"unit-ideas\" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase history of ideas by \"intellectual history\".\n\nIntellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the history of philosophy, and the history of economic thought. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of Thomas Kuhn about The Structure of Scientific Revolutions to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.\n\nIn Britain the history of political thought has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with historians at Cambridge, such as John Dunn and Quentin Skinner. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history. \n\nIn the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with Anthony Grafton of Princeton University and J.G.A. Pocock of Johns Hopkins University. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at Drew University is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include Louis Menand's \"\" and Martin Jay's \"The Dialectical Imagination\".\n\nIn continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is Reinhart Koselleck’s \"Begriffsgeschichte\" (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The subspecies may have survived the last Ice Age in Italy.\nIt is genetically a different subspecies than that from the Iberian peninsula and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all honey bees, and has proven adaptable to most climates from subtropical to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid tropical regions. It is sometimes called the Ligurian bee.\n\nItalian bees, having been conditioned to the warmer climate of the central Mediterranean, are less able to cope with the \"hard\" winters and cool, wet springs of more northern latitudes. They do not form such tight winter clusters. More food has to be consumed to compensate for the greater heat loss from the loose cluster. The tendency to raise broods late in autumn also increases food consumption.

In spite of his great aptitude for the natural sciences, Leon studied and received a degree in Law from the University of Turin.\n\nCroizat and his family (wife Lucia and two children) emgirated to the United States in 1924; an avid artist, Leon worked selling his artwork for several years, but could not succeed economically as a working artist after the stock market crash of 1929. During the 1930s, Croizat found a job identifying plants as part of a topographic inventory performed in the public parks of New York City. During his visits to the Bronx Botanical Gardens, he became acquainted with Dr. E. D. Merrill. When Merrill was appointed director of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in 1936, he hired Leon as a technical assistant (in 1937.)\n\nCroizat became a prolific student and publisher, studying important aspects of the distribution and evolution of biological species. It was during this time that he began to formulate a novel current of thought in evolutionary theory, opposed in some respects to Darwinism, on the evolution and dispersal of biota over space, through time.\nIn 1947, Croizat moved to Venezuela after receiving an invitation from botanist Henri Pittier. Croizat then obtained a position in the Faculty of the Department of Agronomy at the Central University of Venezuela. In 1951 he was promoted and was awarded the title of Professor of Botany and Ecology at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. Between 1951 and 1952 he participated in the Franco-Venezuelan expedition to discover the sources of the Orinoco river. Croizat served with the expedition as a botanist with professor Jose Maria Cruxent.\n\nDuring his time in Venezuela Croizat divorced his first wife. Croizat was later remarried to his second wife Catalina Krishaber, a Hungarian immigrant. In 1953 Croizat gave up all official academic positions to work full-time researching biology. Croizat and his wife Catalina lived in Caracas until 1976. In 1976 they took over as first directors of the “Jardin Botanico Xerofito” in Coro, a city approximately 400 kilometers West of Caracas. Jardin Botanico Xerofito was a botanical garden which they founded together. Croizat and Catalina worked for six years to establish Jardin Botanico Xerofito.\n\nCroizat died at Coro on November 30, 1982 of a heart attack. During his life, Croizat has published around 300 scientific papers and seven books, amounting to more than 15,000 printed pages. He was honoured by Venezuela with the Henri Pittier Order of Merit in Conservation, and by the government of Italy with the Order of Merit. Croizat is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, \"Mabuya croizati\". Several plant and animal species have been named after Croizat.\n\nPanbiogeography is a discipline based on the analysis of patterns of distribution of organisms. The method analyzes biogeographic distributions through the drawing of tracks, and derives information from the form and orientation of those tracks. A track is a line connecting collection localities or disjunct areas of a particular taxon. Several individual tracks for unrelated groups of organisms form a generalized ('standard') track, where the individual components are relict fragments of an ancestral, more widespread biota fragmented by geological and/or climatic changes. A node arises from the intersection of two or more generalized tracks \n\nIn graph theory a track is equated to a minimum spanning tree connecting all localities by the shortest path.\n\nTo explain disjunct distributions, Croizat proposed the existence of broadly distributed ancestors that established its range during a period of mobilism, followed by a form-making process over a broad front. Disjunctions are explained as extinctions in the previously continuous range. Orthogenesis is a term used by Croizat, in his words \"... in a pure mechanistic sense\", which refers to the fact that a variation in form is limited and constrained. Croizat considered organism evolution as a function of time, space and form. Of these three essential factors, space is the one with which biogeography is primarily concerned. However space necessarily interplays with time and form, therefore the three factors are as one of biogeographic concern. Put another way, when evolution is considered to be guided by developmental constraints or by phylogenetic constraints, it is orthogenetic.\n\nAlthough authors belonging to the dispersalist establishment have dismissed Croizat's contributions, others have considered Croizat as one of the most original thinkers of modern comparative biology, whose contributions provided the foundation of a new synthesis between earth and life sciences. Panbiogeography became established as a productive research programme in historical biogeography \n\n\n\n"}

He declares his research has determined that Mary, mother of Jesus, was a prostitute, that early Christians practised prostitution, and that Jesus' Parable of the Talents should be read in a pro-prostitution light. Brown describes himself as a Christian who is \"not at all concerned with imposing 'moral' values or religious laws on others\" and believes that Biblical figures such as Abel and Job \"find favour with God because they oppose his will or challenge him in some way\".\n\nBrown adapts the stories or portions of stories of Cain and Abel, Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, Mary, mother of Jesus, the Parable of the talents, Mary of Bethany, Matthew, and the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Handwritten appendices make up the final third of the book, including commentary on the comics, a 55-title bibliography, and a 20-page comics adaptation of the Book of Job.\n\nBrown lays out the simple, precise artwork in a fixed grid of four panels to a page. The dialogue is plain and direct. The cover features a vagina-shaped frame into which Brown incorporates two smiling snakes and an open book, from which red drops fall.\n\nIn the book's appendices, Brown puts forth his interpretations of the stories. He argues that prostitution had an honorable place in Biblical society, and that Matthew left clues in his narrative that Mary was a prostitute. Brown details facts from his research that coloured his interpretations, such as that \"feet\" was used as a euphemism for \"penis\".

Melioration theory is used as an explanation for why an organism makes choices based on the rewards or reinforcers it receives. The principle of melioration states that animals will invest increasing amounts of time and/or effort into whichever alternative is better. To meliorate essentially means to \"make better\".\n\nMelioration theory accounts for many of the choices that organisms make when presented with two variable interval schedules. Melioration is a form of matching where the subject is constantly shifting its behavior from the poorer reinforcement schedule to the richer reinforcement schedule, until it is spending most of its time at the richest variable interval schedule. By matching, the subject is equalizing the price of the reinforcer they are working for. This is also called hyperbolic discounting. In making a choice between options, living organisms need not maximize expected payoff as classical economic theory posits. Rather than being aggregated, the options compete against one another based on differences in their local reinforcement rate. The organism continuously shifts from one alternative to the other, if one is better than the other, until the other is better than the first one, regardless of the effect on overall rate of reinforcement. Melioration is capable of accounting for behavior on both concurrent ratio and concurrent interval schedules.\n\nMelioration Equation\nR1/B1 = R2/B2\n\nIf this ratio is not equal, the animal will shift its behavior to the alternative that currently has the higher response ratio. When the ratio is equal, the \"cost\" of each reinforcer is the same for both alternatives.\n\nMelioration theory grew out of an impersonal anonymous interest in how the matching law comes to hold on. Richard J. Herrnstein (1961) reported that on concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules, the proportion of responses to one alternative was approximately equal to the proportion of reinforcer received there. This finding is summarized in the matching law, which generated a great deal of both matching research and matching theorizing. Herrnstein (1970) suggested that matching may be a basic behavioral process, whereas Rachlin et al. (1976) suggested that matching comes about because it maximizes rate of matching reinforcement.\n\nWilliam Vaughan, Jr. (1976) suggested that the local rate of matching reinforcement on each reinforcement matching schedule is evaluated, and if those local rates differ, the distribution of time on a schedule is shifted from the poorer to the better schedule. On concurrent VIVIVI reinforcement schedules this process gives rise to matching, whereas on concurrent VRVRVR reinforcement schedules it gives rise to exclusive preferences for the better alternative and not the worse alternative. This rule was subsequently named Melioration (Herrnstein & Vaughan, 1980). See also Herrnstein, 1982, Vaughan, 1981; Vaughan & Herrnstein, 1987)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38360894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38360894", "title": "Mood (literature)", "text": "Mood (literature)\n\nIn literature, mood is the atmosphere of the narrative. Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions. Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree. Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story. It is to fiction what the sensory level is to poetry. Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.\n\nMood is generally created through several different things.\nSetting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a cowboy story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.\nThe attitude of the narrator is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is diction, that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.\n\nTone and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in first-person narratives. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing. The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.\n"}

McClelland's thinking was influenced by the pioneering work of Henry Murray, who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including needs for achievement, power, and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book \"The Achieving Society\", A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, \"social\" and \"personal\".\n\nHenry Murray was one of the first psychologists to systematically investigate human needs. In his 1938 book, \"Explorations in Human Personality\", he identified and labeled twenty needs he believed were universal in nature for all humans. Later research demonstrated that Murray's system of needs positively correlates with the Big Five personality traits.\n\nIn the 1960s, psychologist David McClelland expanded on Murray's work, focusing on the effects of human needs in a work environment. His need theory proposes that most people are consistently motivated by one of three basic desires: the need for affiliation, the need for achievement, or the need for power.\n\nTo determine how strongly an individual felt each of the three needs, McClelland used the thematic apperception test (TAT), which is designed to uncover a person's unconscious drives, emotions, wants and needs. During the test, a psychologist shows an individual a series of picture cards depicting ambiguous situations and asks them to tell a story about each image. The psychologist then interprets those stories to identify desires or personality traits the individual may be are unaware of or want to hide. Several empirical studies have demonstrated that the TAT cannot detect mental illness at a rate higher than chance, and the inter-rater validity as measured by Cronbach's alpha (the likelihood of two psychologists providing similar interpretations of the same person's results) is low, especially if the clinician gives a subjective interpretation instead of using the test's original scoring system. However, proponents of the TAT argue that Cronbach's alpha is artificially low for tests with a small number of items, and that the TAT provides a more detailed and flexible description of an individual than a structured questionnaire.\n\nMcClelland defines the need for power (nPow) as a desire for \"power either to control other people (for <nowiki>[one's]</nowiki> own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good),\" and describes people high in this trait as seeking \"neither recognition nor approval from others - only agreement and compliance.\". In his later research, McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation: the need for \"socialized power\", expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans, self-doubts, mixed outcomes, and concern for others, and the need for \"personal power\", expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it. Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement, individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative, more assertive in group discussions, and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation. They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others, and to engage in conspicuous consumption.\n\nA high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace. McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace, especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions. In one characteristic example, a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management. He experienced difficulty giving direct orders, leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well.\n\nOutside of work, a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility. When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility, a high nPow score predicts higher rates of externalizing self-destructive behavior, such as binge-drinking and physical aggression. Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce, separate, or physically abuse their spouses. However, this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores, who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles.\n\nAs with individual outcomes, whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits, particularly responsibility and empathy. An argumentative group member may prevent groupthink, or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises; a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team, or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates. Even dangerous behaviors, like impulsive risk-taking, can be beneficial in moderation: successful stock traders and entrepreneurs often have a high propensity for risk.\n\nOn average, men report a higher need for power than women, which may be due to biological factors, social factors, or an interaction between them. Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed: men are more likely to express anger directly, use physical violence to establish control, or engage in risky or impulsive behavior, while women are more likely to employ relational aggression or suppress their hostility. When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately, women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts, but an equal desire for personal power. Men, but not women, reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power.\n\nMurray defined need for achievement as the attempt to overcome obstacles. Need for achievement (nAch) was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard. McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory. He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures. Based on his/her story, McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived.\n\nMurray believed need for affiliation was a trait that was very strong in most people, especially in stressful situations. Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation, people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present. In McClelland's research, he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them.\n\n"}

It is found in the Upanishads and the Avadhuta Gita and constitutes an analytical meditation helping a person to understand the nature of Brahman by first understanding what is not Brahman. It corresponds to the western \"via negativa\", a mystical approach that forms a part of the tradition of apophatic theology. One of the key elements of Jnana Yoga practice is often a \"neti neti search.\" The purpose of the exercise is to negate rationalizations and other distractions from the non-conceptual meditative awareness of reality.\n\nNeti neti, meaning, \"Not this, not this\", is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. It is a keynote of Vedic inquiry. With its aid the Jnani negates identification with all things of this world which is not the Atman, in this way he negates the Anatman. Through this gradual process he negates the mind and transcends all worldly experiences that are negated till nothing remains but the Self. He attains union with the Absolute by denying the body, name, form, intellect, senses and all limiting adjuncts and discovers what remains, the true \"I\" alone. L.C.Beckett in his book, \"Neti Neti,\" explains that this expression is an expression of something inexpressible, it expresses the ‘suchness’ (the essence) of that which it refers to when ‘no other definition applies to it’. Neti neti negates all descriptions about the Ultimate Reality but not the Reality itself. Intuitive interpretation of uncertainty principle can be expressed by \"Neti neti\" that annihilates ego and the world as non-self (Anatman), it annihilates our sense of self altogether.\n\nAdi Shankara was one of the foremost Advaita philosophers who advocated the neti-neti approach. In his commentary on Gaudapada’s Karika, he explains that Brahman is free from adjuncts and the function of \"neti neti\" is to remove the obstructions produced by ignorance. His disciple, Sureshvara, further explains that the negation, \"neti neti\", does not have negation as its purpose, it purports identity. The sage of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II iii 1-6, beginning with there are two forms of Brahman, the material and the immaterial, the solid and the fluid, the Sat ‘being’ and tya, ‘that’ of Satya – which means true, denies the existence of everything other than Brahman. And therefore, there exists no separate entity like Jiva which Shankara states is the reflection of Brahman in Avidya (ignorance).\n\nThe following was extracted from Avadhuta Gita on Wikisource:\n<poem>\nSanskrit in Devanagari:\nतत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्येन स्वात्मा हि प्रतिपादितः ।\nनेति नेति श्रुतिर्ब्रूयाद अनृतं पाञ्चभौतिकम् ।। २५।।\n\nIAST:\ntattvamasyādivākyena svātmā hi pratipāditaḥ /\nneti neti śrutirbrūyād anṛtaṁ pāñcabhautikam //25//\n\nBy such sentences as \"That thou art,\" our own Self is affirmed. Of that which is untrue and composed of the five elements - the Sruti (scripture) says, \"Not this, not this.\"\n</poem>\n\n"}

The document was created by the International Law Commission of the United Nations to codify the legal principles underlying the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi party members following World War II.\n\nAny person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment.\n\nThe fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.\n\nThe fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law, acted as Head of State or responsible government official, does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.\n\nThe fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\n\nThis principle could be paraphrased as follows: \"It is not an acceptable excuse to say 'I was just following my superior's orders'\".\n\nPrevious to the time of the Nuremberg Trials, this excuse was known in common parlance as \"Superior Orders\". After the prominent, high-profile event of the Nuremberg Trials, that excuse is now referred to by many as the \"Nuremberg Defense\". In recent times, a third term, \"lawful orders\" has become common parlance for some people. All three terms are in use today, and they all have slightly different nuances of meaning, depending on the context in which they are used.\n\nNuremberg Principle IV is legally supported by the jurisprudence found in certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which deal indirectly with conscientious objection. It is also supported by the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status which was issued by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which conscientious objectors can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.\n\nAny person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law.\n\nComplicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.\n\nIn the period just prior to the June 26, 1945 signing of the Charter of the United Nations, the governments participating in its drafting were opposed to conferring on the United Nations legislative power to enact binding rules of international law. As a corollary, they also rejected proposals to confer on the General Assembly the power to impose certain general conventions on states by some form of majority vote. There was, however, strong support for conferring on the General Assembly the more limited powers of study and recommendation, which led to the adoption of Article 13 in Chapter IV of the Charter. It obliges the United Nations General Assembly to initiate studies and to make recommendations that encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification. The Nuremberg Principles were developed by UN organs under that limited mandate.\n\nUnlike treaty law, customary international law is not written. To prove that a certain rule is customary one has to show that it is reflected in state practice and that there exists a conviction in the international community that such practice is required as a matter of law. (For example, the Nuremberg Trials were a \"practice\" of the \"international law\" of the Nuremberg Principles; and that \"practice\" was supported by the international community.) In this context, \"practice\" relates to official state practice and therefore includes formal statements by states. A contrary practice by some states is possible. If this contrary practice is condemned by other states then the rule is confirmed. (See also: Sources of international law)\n\nIn 1947, under UN General Assembly Resolution 177 (II), paragraph (a), the International Law Commission was directed to \"formulate the principles of international law recognized in the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal and in the judgment of the Tribunal.\" In the course of the consideration of this subject, the question arose as to whether or not the Commission should ascertain to what extent the principles contained in the Charter and judgment constituted principles of international law. The conclusion was that since the Nuremberg Principles had been affirmed by the General Assembly, the task entrusted to the Commission was not to express any appreciation of these principles as principles of international law but merely to formulate them. The text above was adopted by the Commission at its second session. The Report of the Commission also contains commentaries on the principles (see Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, Vol. II, pp. 374–378).\n\nConcerning Nuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, it could be argued that a version of the Superior Orders defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.) Article 33, titled \"Superior Orders and prescription of law,\"\nstates:\n\n2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.\n\nThere are two interpretations of this Article:\n\n\nNuremberg Principle IV, and its reference to an individual's responsibility, was also at issue in Canada in the case of \"Hinzman v. Canada.\" Jeremy Hinzman was a U.S. Army deserter who claimed refugee status in Canada as a conscientious objector, one of many Iraq War resisters. Hinzman's lawyer, Jeffry House, had previously raised the issue of the legality of the Iraq War as having a bearing on their case. The Federal Court ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim. In the decision, Justice Anne L. Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility:\n\nAn individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war-time conduct is otherwise proper.\nOn Nov 15, 2007, a quorum of the Supreme Court of Canada consisting of Justices Michel Bastarache, Rosalie Abella, and Louise Charron refused an application to have the Court hear the case on appeal, without giving reasons.\n\n"}

{"id": "38945358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38945358", "title": "Relation (history of concept)", "text": "Relation (history of concept)\n\nThe concept of relation as a term used in general philosophy has a long and complicated history. One of the interests for the Greek philosophers lay in the number of ways in which a particular thing might be described, and the establishment of a relation between one thing and another was one of these. A second interest lay in the difference between these relations and the things themselves. This was to culminate in the view that the things in themselves could not be known except through their relations. Debates similar to these continue into modern philosophy and include further investigations into types of relation and whether relations exist only in the mind or the real world or both.\n\nAn understanding of types of relation is important to an understanding of relations between many things including those between people, communities and the wider world. Most of these are complex relations but of the simpler, analytical relations out of which they are formed there are generally held to be three types, although opinion on the number may differ. The three types are spatial relations which include geometry and number, relations of cause and effect, and the classificatory relations of similarity and difference that underlie knowledge. Going by different names in the sciences, mathematics, and the arts they can be thought of as three large families and it is the history of these that will be dealt with here.\n\nTraditionally the history of the concept of relation begins with Aristotle and his concept of relative terms. In \"Metaphysics\" he states: \"Things are called relative as the double to the half... as that which can act to that which can be acted upon... and as the knowable to knowledge\". It has been argued that the content of these three types can be traced back to the Eleatic Dilemmas, a series of puzzles through which the world can be explained in totally opposite ways, for example things can be both one and many, both moving and stationary and both like and unlike one another.\n\nFor Aristotle relation was one of ten distinct kinds of predicate (Gk. \"kategorien\") which list the range of things that can be said about any particular subject: \"...each signifies either substance or quantity or quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon\". Subjects and predicates were combined together to form simple propositions. These were later redefined as \"categorical\" propositions in order to distinguish them from two other types of proposition, the disjunctive and the hypothetical, identified a little later by Chrysippus.\n\nAn alternative strand of thought at the time was that relation was more than just one of ten equal categories. A fundamental opposition was developing between substance and relation. Plato in \"Theaetetus\" had noted that \"some say all things are said to be relative\" and Speusippus, his nephew and successor at the Academy maintained the view that \"... a thing cannot be known apart from the knowledge of other things, for to know what a thing is, we must know how it differs from other things\".\n\nPlotinus in third century Alexandria reduced Aristotle's categories to five: substance, relation, quantity, motion and quality. He gave further emphasis to the distinction between substance and relation and stated that there were grounds for the latter three: quantity, motion and quality to be considered as relations. Moreover, these latter three categories were posterior to the Eleatic categories, namely unity/plurality; motion/stability and identity/difference concepts that Plotinus called \"the hearth of reality\".\n\nPlotinus liked to picture relations as lines linking elements, but in a process of abstraction our minds tend to ignore the lines \"and think only of their terminals\". His pupil and biographer, Porphyry, developed a tree analogy picturing the relations of knowledge as a tree branching from the highest genera down through intermediate species to the individuals themselves.\n\nThe opposition between substance and relation was given a theological perspective in the Christian era. Basil in the Eastern church suggested that an understanding of the Trinity lay more in understanding the types of relation existing between the three members of the Godhead than in the nature of the Persons themselves. Thomas Aquinas in the Western church noted that in God \"relations are real\", and, echoing Aristotle, claimed that there were indeed three type of relation which give a natural order to the world. These were quantity, as in double and half; activity, as in acting and being acted upon; and understanding, through the qualitative concepts of genus and species. \"Some have said that relation is not a reality but only an idea. But this is plainly seen to be false from the very fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and relation... There are three conditions that make a relation to be real or logical ...\" \n\nThe end of the Scholastic period marked the beginning of a decline in the pre-eminence of the classificatory relation as a way of explaining the world. Science was now in the ascendant and with it scientific reason and the relation of cause and effect. In Britain, John Locke, influenced by Isaac Newton and the laws of motion, developed a similar mechanistic view of the human mind. Following Hobbes's notion of \"trains of thought\" where one idea naturally follows another in the mind, Locke developed further the concept of knowledge as the perception of relations between ideas. These relations included mathematical relations, scientific relations such as co-existence and succession, and the relations of identity and difference.\n\nIt was left to the Scottish philosopher David Hume to reduce these kinds of mental association to three: \"To me there appears to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect\".\n\nThe problem which troubled Hume of being able to establish the reality of relations from experience, in particular the relation of cause and effect, was solved in another way by Immanuel Kant who took the view that our knowledge is only partly derived from the external world. Part of our knowledge he argued must be due to the modifying nature of our own minds which imposes on perception not only the forms of space and time but also the categories of relation which he understood to be \"a priori\" concepts contained within the understanding. Of these he famously said: \"Everything in our knowledge... contains nothing but mere relations\".\n\nKant took a more analytical view of the concept of relation and his categories of relation were three namely, community, causality and inherence. These can be compared with Hume's three kinds of association in that, firstly, community depicts elements conjoined in time and space, secondly causality compares directly with cause and effect, and thirdly inherence implies the relation of a quality to its subject and plays an essential part in any consideration of the concept of resemblance. Preceding the table of categories in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" is the table of judgements and here, under the heading of relation, are the three types of syllogism namely the disjunctive, the hypothetical and the categorical, developed as we have seen through Aristotle, Chryssipus and the logicians of the Middle Ages. Schopenhauer raised objections to the term Community and the term disjunction, as a relation, can be usefully substituted for the more complex concept of community. G.W.F.Hegel also referred to three types of proposition but in Hegel the categories of relation which for Kant were \"subjective mental processes\" have now become \"objective ontological entities\".\n\nC.S. Peirce in America recorded that his own categories of relation grew originally out of a study of Kant. He introduced three metaphysical categories which pervaded his philosophy, and these were ordered through a consideration of the development of our mental processes:\n\n\nThese categories of relation appeared in Peirce's logic of relatives and followed earlier work undertaken by the mathematician Augustus De Morgan at Cambridge who had introduced the notion of relation into formal logic in 1849. Among the philosophers who followed may be mentioned T.H Green in England who took the view that all reality lies in relations and William James in America who, emphasising the concept of relation, pictured the world as a \"concatenated unity\" with some parts joined and other parts disjoined.\n\nBertrand Russell, in 1921, reinforced James's view that \"... the raw material out of which the world is built up, is not of two sorts, one matter and one mind but that it is designed in different patterns by its interrelations, and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical\". Wittgenstein, also in 1921, saw the same kinds of relation structuring both the material world and the mental world. While the real world consisted of objects and their relations which combined together to form facts, the mental world consisted of similar subjects and predicates which pictured or described the real world. For Wittgenstein there were three kinds of description (enumeration, function and law) which themselves bear a notable if distant \"family resemblance\" to the three kinds of relation whose history we have been following.\n\nAlso of note at the beginning of the twentieth century were arguments associated with G.E.Moore among others concerning the concept of internal and external relations whereby relations could be seen as either contingent or accidental parts of the definition of a thing.\n"}
{"id": "3803971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3803971", "title": "Road diet", "text": "Road diet\n\nA road diet, also called a lane reduction or road rechannelization, is a technique in transportation planning whereby the number of travel lanes and/or effective width of the road is reduced in order to achieve systemic improvements.\n\nA typical road diet technique is to reduce the number of lanes on a roadway cross-section. One of the most common applications of a road diet is to improve safety or provide space for other modes of travel. For example, a two-way, four lane road might be reduced to one travel lane in each direction. The freed-up space is then used to provide or enhance some of the following features:\n\n\nIf properly designed, traffic does not divert to other streets after a road diet, because the road previously provided excessive capacity. In other scenarios, reduction of traffic (either local traffic or overall traffic) is intended in the scheme. Road diets are usually successful on roads carrying fewer than 19,000 vehicles per day. Road diets can succeed at volumes up to about 23,000 vehicles per day. However, more extensive reconstruction is needed. Examples include replacing signals with roundabouts, traffic calming on parallel streets to discourage traffic from diverting away from the main road, and other means to keep traffic moving smoothly and uniformly.\n\nIn a lane diet, the width of a lane is decreased to reduce vehicle speeds and yield space for other use. Typically vehicular travel lane widths are narrowed to no more than ten feet, and left turn (in countries where drivers use the right-hand side of the road) storage lanes to nine or ten feet. Resulting space can be applied to pedestrian refuges, medians, sidewalks, shoulders, parking, or bike lanes. Lane width guidelines in the United States are offered as a range and lane diets fall within this range.\n\nIn many cases of four-lane roadways with double-yellow, this can present a hazard for oncoming traffic in the \"passing lane\", as well as left-turners. Sometimes four-lane with double-yellow is upgraded to five-lane with center turn lane since that practice is more of an upgrade than a \"diet\" like three-lane with center turn lane is.\n\nProponents of road diets generally believe key benefits include lower vehicular speeds, reduced crash rates, and improved pedestrian safety. Other benefits of road diets include promoting better land use, reducing induced traffic, promoting greater driving attentiveness, and promoting cycling through the addition of bicycle lanes. Providing dedicated left turn (in countries that drive on the right-hand side of the road) lanes at intersections can improve vehicular safety and can enable efficiency gains along the roadway.\n\nResearchers have found that road diets can be expected to reduce overall crash frequency by 19% to 43%, with the higher crash reductions occurring in small urban areas than in metropolitan areas.\n\nA leading proponent of road diets is former Florida Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator Dan Burden, who now helms the Walkable and Livable Communities Institute. Burden and Peter Lagerwey published an article on the topic in 1999 noting that in two cases, 95% of residents were initially opposed to roadway constriction. Additional studies have shown that road diets often achieve these positive effects without reducing traffic volumes.\n\nAmong studies now showing that there are safety improvements to driving when lane widths are reduced include a recent report by the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) and work analyzing traffic safety for 14 years in all 50 states by Robert B. Noland.\n\nCritics of road diets generally believe they can negatively affect the speed and reliability of transit service operating on the roadway, particularly if bus stops are located in pullouts and traffic queues delay buses attempting to re-enter traffic. Constructing bus bulbs can mitigate these effects though this feature results in delays for other vehicles.\n\nNot all multi-lane arterials are good candidates for road constriction. Added congestion can outweigh benefits if vehicle traffic volumes exceed the capacity of the three-lane roadway. This threshold is approximately 20,000 vehicles per day. Burden notes additional characteristics of better candidates for vehicle lane removal.\n\nOther concerns regard public safety; police, fire and ambulances may be slowed and if an evacuation is ordered, the evacuation will be slower.\n\nThe 2018 \"Camp\" fire, in which the town of Paradise CA completely burned, is thought to have been made more catastrophic due to the implementation of a road diet. The city's decision to install a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet along its primary traffic artery may have contributed to loss of life as traffic backed up and gridlocked. Some were reduced to fleeing on foot. Others were unable to outrun the flames and lost their lives.\n\nFires happen in Butte county. In 2008, ten years prior to the one that totally destroyed the town, a massive fire prompted evacuations of the communities of Paradise and Magalia. The evacuation was plagued with gridlock. In shades of the fatal future fire, many residents were trapped in their cars with flames racing along both sides of the road. With cars hopelessly blocked, these people fled on foot, barely escaping with their lives.\n\nThe final report of the Butte County Grand Jury investigation of the 2008 incident noted there are only four roads of escape for 40,000 people in Paradise, Magalia, and Upper Ridge. Three of those routes are narrow, two lane mountain roads. The grand jury noted that these roads have “significant constraints limiting their use as evacuation routes during a major event, especially another event of multiple fires.”\n\nThe only area road capable of handing more than a small capacity was Skyway Boulevard, a state highway connecting the mountain towns with the city of Chico. The grand jury recommended, “immediate modification of Skyway, from Paradise to Chico, as an emergency evacuation route, by removing trees and brush and creating fire barriers on both sides of the road.”\n\nInstead, in 2012 the county decided to narrow Skyway in Paradise, in a Vision Zero-Type Road Diet, removing lanes and instead installing bike lanes, bulb-outs and other traffic calming measures. In the 2018 fire, grid lock became the the tragedy of trapped people burning to death in and beside their cars.\n\nAt its height, the 2018 fire was wind driven to such speeds that it was burning slightly more than the area of a football field each second. Escape was possible via car. However it is impossible to escape a fire burning that fast on foot, turning the gridlock into a pyre.\n\nAmong American cities, San Francisco has completed the most road diet projects, over 40 since the late 1970s. Valencia Street, which was reduced from four to two travel lanes with a center turn lane and bike lanes added in March 1999, has become a national model for traffic engineers of the common \"4-to-3 lane\" road diet type.\n\nSan Jose, California has implemented several road diets since November 2011, when the City Council unanimously adopted its \"Envision 2040\" General Plan, which calls for road diets on streets with excess vehicle capacity \"to provide wider sidewalks, bicycle lanes, transit amenities, and/or landscaping\". Road diets were completed on 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 11th streets in August 2012, and on Hedding Street in July 2013.\n\nPalo Alto, California has studied reducing the number of travel lanes to improve safety on some of its busiest streets since adopting a new Comprehensive Plan in 1998. Design plans were made for road diets on Embarcadero Road and Middlefield Road in the early 2000s, but were never brought to the city council for approval. 75-yr-old local resident Ming Yuan Zuo was killed by a pickup truck driver while walking across Embarcadero Road in January 2013. Lane reductions were approved and then implemented on Charleston Road in 2006, Arastadero Road in 2010, and Deer Creek Road in 2011.\n\nIn Tampa, Florida, Nebraska Avenue between its intersection with Hillsborough Avenue (US 92-US 41-FL 600) and Adamo Drive was reduced from four to three lanes, complete with bicycle lanes, a left turn lane and embedded bus stops for HART buses. Construction was completed in 2009.\n\nIn Rutland, Vermont, the city briefly converted Woodstock Avenue from a four-lane road to a three-lane road with bicycle lanes on each side. However, due mainly to opposition from businesses alongside the road in June 2014, Woodstock Avenue was returned to its previous four-lane configuration.\n\n"}

{"id": "208305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208305", "title": "Shyness", "text": "Shyness\n\nShyness (also called diffidence) is the feeling of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness especially when a person is around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low self-esteem. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as social anxiety or social phobia.\nThe primary defining characteristic of shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying what they want to out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.\n\nOne important aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly \"assume\" children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not given an opportunity to develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.\n\nThe initial cause of shyness varies. Scientists believe that they have located genetic data supporting the hypothesis that shyness is, at least, partially genetic. However, there is also evidence that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their shyness. This includes child abuse, particularly emotional abuse such as ridicule. Shyness can originate after a person has experienced a physical anxiety reaction; at other times, shyness seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. Shyness differs from social anxiety, which is a broader, often depression-related psychological condition including the experience of fear, apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing panic.\n\nShyness may come from genetic traits, the environment in which a person is raised and personal experiences. Shyness may be a personality trait or can occur at certain stages of development in children.\n\nShyness is often seen as a hindrance to people and their development. The cause of shyness is often disputed but it is found that fear is positively related to shyness, suggesting that fearful children are much more likely to develop being shy as opposed to children less fearful. Shyness can also be seen on a biological level as a result of an excess of cortisol. When cortisol is present in greater quantities it is known to suppress an individual's immune system, making them more susceptible to illness and disease. The genetics of shyness is a relatively small area of research that has been receiving an even smaller amount of attention, although papers on the biological bases of shyness date back to 1988. Some research has indicated that shyness and aggression are related—through long and short forms of the gene DRD4, though considerably more research on this is needed. Further, it has been suggested that shyness and social phobia (the distinction between the two is becoming ever more blurred) are related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. As with other studies of behavioral genetics, the study of shyness is complicated by the number of genes involved in, and the confusion in defining, the phenotype. Naming the phenotype – and translation of terms between genetics and psychology — also causes problems.\n\nSeveral genetic links to shyness are current areas of research. One is the serotonin transporter promoter region polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), the long form of which has been shown to be modestly correlated with shyness in grade school children. Previous studies had shown a connection between this form of the gene and both obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism. Mouse models have also been used, to derive genes suitable for further study in humans; one such gene, the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene (which encodes an enzyme that functions in GABA synthesis), has so far been shown to have some association with behavioral inhibition.\n\nAnother gene, the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III polymorphism, had been the subject of studies in both shyness and aggression and is currently the subject of studies on the \"novelty seeking\" trait. A 1996 study of anxiety-related traits (shyness being one of these) remarked that, \"Although twin studies have indicated that individual variation in measures of anxiety-related personality traits is 40-60% heritable, none of the relevant genes has yet been identified\", and that \"10 to 15 genes might be predicted to be involved\" in the anxiety trait. Progress has been made since then, especially in identifying other potential genes involved in personality traits, but there has been little progress made towards confirming these relationships. The long version of the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is now postulated to be correlated with shyness, but in the 1996 study, the short version was shown to be related to anxiety-based traits.\n\nExcessive shyness, embarrassment, self-consciousness and timidity, social-phobia and lack of self-confidence are also components of erethism, which is a symptom complex that appears in cases of mercury poisoning. Mercury poisoning was common among hat makers in England in the 18th and 19th centuries, who used mercury to stabilize wool into felt fabric.\n\nThe prevalence of shyness in some children can be linked to day length during pregnancy, particularly during the midpoint of prenatal development. An analysis of longitudinal data from children living at specific latitudes in the United States and New Zealand revealed a significant relationship between hours of day length during the midpoint of pregnancy and the prevalence of shyness in children. \"The odds of being classified as shy were 1.52 times greater for children exposed to shorter compared to longer daylengths during gestation.\" In their analysis, scientists assigned conception dates to the children relative to their known birth dates, which allowed them to obtain random samples from children who had a mid-gestation point during the longest hours of the year and the shortest hours of the year (June and December, depending on whether the cohorts were in the United States or New Zealand).\n\nThe longitudinal survey data included measurements of shyness on a five-point scale based on interviews with the families being surveyed, and children in the top 25th percentile of shyness scores were identified. The data revealed a significant co-variance between the children who presented as being consistently shy over a two-year period, and shorter day length during their mid-prenatal development period. \"Taken together, these estimates indicate that about one out of five cases of extreme shyness in children can be associated with gestation during months of limited daylength.\"\n\nIn recent years correlations between birth weight and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at low birth weights are more likely to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights. These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nShyness is most likely to occur during unfamiliar situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself. Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a child who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when older and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong character trait. Longitudinal data suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency to internalize or externalize problems. This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend to internalize their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety. Humans experience shyness to different degrees and in different areas.\n\nShyness can also be seen as an academic determinant. It has been determined that there is a negative relationship between shyness and classroom performance. As the shyness of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.\n\nShyness may involve the discomfort of difficulty in knowing what to say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves a combination of both symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.\n\nThose who are shy are perceived more negatively, in cultures that value sociability, because of the way they act towards others. Shy individuals are often distant during conversations, which can result in others forming poor impressions of them. People who are not shy may be up-front, aggressive, or critical towards shy people in an attempt \"to get them out of their shell.\" This can actually make a shy person feel worse, as it draws attention to them, making them more self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nThe term shyness may be implemented as a lay blanket-term for a family of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including timidity (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence). Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or introversion, character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.\n\nRather, according to professor of psychology Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts \"choose\" to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations. Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of shyness or introversion may reinforce a shy or introverted individual's low self-confidence.\n\nBoth shyness and introversion can outwardly manifest with socially withdrawn behaviors, such as tendencies to avoid social situations, especially when they are unfamiliar. A variety of research suggests that shyness and introversion possess clearly distinct motivational forces and lead to uniquely different personal and peer reactions and therefore cannot be described as theoretically the same, with Susan Cain's \"\" (2012) further discerning introversion as involving being \"differently\" social (preferring one-on-one or small group interactions) rather than being \"anti\"-social altogether.\n\nResearch suggests that no unique physiological response, such as an increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits. In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively as a threat to group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals. On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.\n\nAn extreme case of shyness is identified as a psychiatric illness, which made its debut as social phobia in DSM-III in 1980, but was then described as rare. By 1994, however, when DSM-IV was published, it was given a second, alternative name in parentheses (social anxiety disorder) and was now said to be relatively common, affecting between 3 and 13% of the population at some point during their lifetime. Studies examining shy adolescents and university students found that between 12 and 18% of shy individuals meet criteria for social anxiety disorder.\n\nShyness affects people mildly in unfamiliar social situations where one feels anxiety about interacting with new people. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, is a strong irrational fear of interacting with people, or being in situations which may involve public scrutiny, because one feels overly concerned about being criticized if one embarrasses oneself. Physical symptoms of social phobia can include blushing, shortness of breath, trembling, increased heart rate, and sweating; in some cases, these symptoms are intense enough and numerous enough to constitute a panic attack. Shyness, on the other hand, may incorporate many of these symptoms, but at a lower intensity, infrequently, and does not interfere tremendously with normal living.\n\nThose considered shy are also said to be \"socially inhibited\". Social inhibition is the conscious or unconscious constraint by a person of behavior of a social nature. In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe. Being socially inhibited is good when preventing one from harming another and bad when causing one to refrain from participating in class discussions.\n\n\"Behavioral inhibition\" is a temperament or personality style that predisposes a person to become fearful, distressed and withdrawn in novel situations. This personality style is associated with the development of anxiety disorders in adulthood, particularly social anxiety disorder.\n\nMany misconceptions/stereotypes about shy individuals exist in western culture and negative peer reactions to \"shy\" behavior abound. This takes place because individualistic cultures place less value on quietness and meekness in social situations, and more often reward outgoing behaviors. Some misconceptions include viewing introversion and social phobia synonymous with shyness, and believing that shy people are less intelligent.\n\nNo correlation (positive or negative) exists between intelligence and shyness. Research indicates that shy children have a harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and because they do not engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with social learning theory, an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement. Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made. Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.\n\nThomas Benton claims that because shy people \"have a tendency toward self-criticism, they are often high achievers, and not just in solitary activities like research and writing. Perhaps even more than the drive toward independent achievement, shy people long to make connections to others often through altruistic behavior.\" Susan Cain describes the benefits that shy people bring to society that US cultural norms devalue. Without characteristics that shy people bring to social interactions, such as sensitivity to the emotions of others, contemplation of ideas, and valuable listening skills, there would be no balance to society. In earlier generations, such as the 1950s, society perceived shyness as a more socially attractive trait, especially in women, indicating that views on shyness vary by culture.\n\nSociologist Susie Scott challenged the interpretation and treatment of shyness as being pathological. \"By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that this is also a \"socially oriented\" state of mind that is \"socially\" produced and managed.\" She explores the idea that \"shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual\", and concludes that, to some extent, \"we are all impostors, faking our way through social life\". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: \"Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs.\"\n\nIn cultures that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can be perceived as weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people may be perceived as being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.\n\nIn cultures that value autonomy, shyness is often analyzed in the context of being a social dysfunction, and is frequently contemplated as a personality disorder or mental health issue. Some researchers are beginning to study comparisons between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, to examine the role that shyness might play in matters of social etiquette and achieving group-oriented goals. \"Shyness is one of the emotions that may serve as behavioral regulators of social relationships in collectivistic cultures. For example, social shyness is evaluated more positively in a collectivistic society, but negatively evaluated in an individualistic society.\"\n\nIn a cross-cultural study of Chinese and Canadian school children, researchers sought to measure several variables related to social reputation and peer relationships, including \"shyness-sensitivity.\" Using peer nomination questionnaire, students evaluated their fellow students using positive and negative playmate nominations. \"Shyness-sensitivity was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of peer acceptance in the Canadian sample. Inconsistent with Western results, it was found that items describing shyness-sensitivity were separated from items assessing isolation in the factor structure for the Chinese sample. Shyness-sensitivity was positively associated with sociability-leadership and with peer acceptance in the Chinese sample.\"\n\nIn some Western cultures shyness-inhibition plays an important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.\n\nBritish writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is not mere self-consciousness, but a primitive suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which needs to be uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.\n\nFor Charles Darwin shyness was an ‘odd state of mind’ appearing to offer no benefit to our species, and since the 1970s the modern tendency in psychology has been to see shyness as pathology. However, evolutionary survival advantages of careful temperaments over adventurous temperaments in dangerous environments have also been recognized.\n\nIn Eastern cultures shyness-inhibition in school-aged children is seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well by peers and are accepted. They tended to be seen as competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals are also more likely to attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness or depression as those in the West do. In Eastern cultures being shy and inhibited is a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.\n\nIn Hispanic cultures shyness and inhibition with authority figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers in front of others, because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy when they are not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore it is common for Hispanic students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.\n\nCultures in which the community is closed and based on agriculture (Kenya, India, etc.) experience lower social engagement than those in more open communities (United States, Okinawa, etc.) where interactions with peers is encouraged. Children in Mayan, Indian, Mexican, and Kenyan cultures are less expressive in social styles during interactions and they spend little time engaged in socio-dramatic activities. They are also less assertive in social situations. Self-expression and assertiveness in social interactions are related to shyness and inhibition in that when one is shy or inhibited one exhibits little or no expressive tendencies. Assertiveness is demonstrated in the same way, being shy and inhibited lessen one's chances of being assertive because of a lack of confidence.\n\nIn the Italian culture emotional expressiveness during interpersonal interaction is encouraged. From a young age children engage in debates or discussions that encourage and strengthen social assertiveness. Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.\n\nPsychological methods and pharmaceutical drugs are commonly used to treat shyness in individuals who feel crippled because of low self-esteem and psychological symptoms, such as depression or loneliness. According to research, early intervention methods that expose shy children to social interactions involving team work, especially team sports, decrease their anxiety in social interactions and increase their all around self-confidence later on. Implementing such tactics could prove to be an important step in combating the psychological effects of shyness that make living normal life difficult for anxious individuals.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24405429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24405429", "title": "Species description", "text": "Species description\n\nA species description is a formal description of a newly discovered species, usually in the form of a scientific paper. Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of organism and explain how it differs from species which have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the type material and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal scientific name. Some 1.9 million species have been identified and described, out of some 8.7 million that may actually exist. Millions more have become extinct.\n\nA name of a new species becomes valid (available in zoological terminology) with the date of publication of its formal scientific description. Once the scientist has performed the necessary research to determine that the discovered organism represents a new species, the scientific results are summarized in a scientific manuscript, either as part of a book, or as a paper to be submitted to a scientific journal.\n\nA scientific species description must fulfill several formal criteria specified by the nomenclature codes, e.g. selection of at least one type specimen. These criteria are intended to ensure that the species name is clear and unambiguous, for example, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) states that \"Authors should exercise reasonable care and consideration in forming new names to ensure that they are chosen with their subsequent users in mind and that, as far as possible, they are appropriate, compact, euphonious, memorable, and do not cause offence.\"\n\nSpecies names are written in the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but many species names are based on words from other languages, Latinized.\n\nOnce the manuscript has been accepted for publication, the new species name is officially created.\n\nOnce a species name has been assigned and approved, it can generally not be changed except in the case of error. For example, a species of beetle (\"Anophthalmus hitleri\") was named by a German collector after Adolf Hitler in 1933 when he had recently become chancellor of Germany. It is not clear whether such a dedication would be considered acceptable or appropriate today, but the name remains in use.\n\nSpecies names have been chosen on many different bases. Most common is a naming for the species' external appearance, its origin, or the species name is a dedication for a certain person. Examples would include a bat species named for the two stripes on its back (\"Saccopteryx bilineata\"), a frog named for its Bolivian origin (\"Phyllomedusa boliviana\"), and an ant species dedicated to the actor Harrison Ford (\"Pheidole harrisonfordi\"). A scientific name in honor of a person or persons is a known as a taxonomic patronym or patronymic.\n\nA number of humorous species names also exist. Literary examples include the genus name \"Borogovia\" (an extinct dinosaur), which is named after the borogove, a mythical character from Lewis Carrol's poem \"Jabberwocky\". A second example, \"Macrocarpaea apparata\" (a tall plant) was named after the magical spell \"to apparate\" from the Harry Potter novels by J. K. Rowling, as it seemed to appear out of nowhere. In 1975, the British naturalist Peter Scott proposed the binomial name \"Nessiteras rhombopteryx\" (\"Ness monster with diamond-shaped fin\") for the Loch Ness Monster; it was soon spotted that it was an anagram of \"Monster hoax by Sir Peter S\".\n\nSpecies have frequently been named by scientists in recognition of supporters and benefactors. For example, the genus \"Victoria\" (a flowering waterplant) was named in honour of Queen Victoria of Great Britain. More recently, a species of lemur (\"Avahi cleesei\") was named after the actor John Cleese in recognition of his work to publicize the plight of lemurs in Madagascar.\n\nNon-profit ecological organizations may also allow benefactors to name new species in exchange for financial support for taxonomic research and nature conservation. A German non-profit organisation (gemeinnütziger Verein), BIOPAT - Patrons for Biodiversity has raised more than $450,000 for research and conservation through sponsorship of over 100 species using this model. An individual example of this system is the \"Callicebus aureipalatii\" (or \"monkey of the Golden Palace\"), which was named after the Golden Palace casino in recognition of a $650,000 contribution to the Madidi National Park in Bolivia in 2005.\n\nThe International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) discourages this practice somewhat: \"Recommendation 20A. Authors forming generic names should comply with the following ... (h) Not dedicate genera to persons quite unconcerned with botany, mycology, phycology, or natural science in general.\"\n\nEarly biologists often published entire volumes or multiple-volume works of descriptions in an attempt to catalog all known species. These catalogs typically featured extensive descriptions of each species and were often illustrated upon reprinting.\n\nThe first of these large catalogs was Aristotle's \"History of Animals\", published around 343 B.C. Aristotle included descriptions of creatures, mostly fish and invertebrates, in his homeland, and several mythological creatures rumored to live in far-away lands, such as the manticore.\n\nIn 77 A.D. Pliny the Elder dedicated several volumes of his \"Natural History\" to the description of all life forms he knew to exist. He appears to have read Aristotle's work, since he writes about many of the same far-away mythological creatures.\n\nToward the end of the 12th century, \"Konungs skuggsjá\", an Old Norse philosophical didactic work, featured several descriptions of the whales, seals, and monsters of the Icelandic seas. These descriptions were brief and often erroneous, and a description of the mermaid and a rare island-like sea monster called Hafgufu was included. The author was hesitant to mention the beast (known today to be fictitious) for fear of its size, but felt it was important enough to be included in his descriptions.\n\nHowever, the earliest recognized species authority is Linnaeus, who standardized the modern taxonomy system beginning with his \"Systema Naturae\" in 1735.\n\nAs the catalog of known species was increasing rapidly, it became impractical to maintain a single work documenting every species. Publishing a paper documenting a single species was much faster and could be done by scientists with less broadened scopes of study. For example, a scientist who discovered a new species of insect would not need to understand plants, or frogs, or even insects which did not resemble the species, but would only need to understand closely related insects.\n\nFormal species descriptions today follow strict guidelines set forth by the codes of nomenclature. Very detailed formal descriptions are made by scientists, who usually study the organism closely for a considerable time. A diagnosis may be used instead of, or as well as the description. A diagnosis specifies the distinction between the new species and other species.\n\nAccording to the RetroSOS report, the following numbers of species have been described each year since 2000.\n\n\n"}

It was formed in 1999 by a group of multidisciplinary scientists, researchers, and software developers, led by Chris Langton. Langton was also the founder of the emerging field of research called artificial life. The initial, primary, role for the SDG was to house continued development of the Swarm simulation software after the software become independent of the SFI in 1999.\n\nThe role of the Swarm Development Group, has since expanded to include the co-ordination of a long-running conference SwarmFest during May, June, or July each summer – typically hosted by a different research university each year. Developers, users, and researchers gather to present research papers and discuss the state of Swarm and other agent-based modeling platforms like RePast (University of Chicago) and Ascape (Brookings). Typically, a wide range of academic, corporate, and government organizations are represented at SwarmFest. The first SwarmFest was in 1998 while Swarm was still sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute. From SwarmFest 2000 onwards, after the SDG was formed in late 1999, SwarmFests were organized directly by the SDG.\n\nRecent SwarmFests have been held at a variety of institutions. SwarmFest 2007 was held at DePaul University's School of Computer Science, Telecommunications, and Information Systems, in downtown Chicago, Illinois. SwarmFest 2008 was held at Northwestern Memorial Hospital/Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in downtown Chicago, Illinois. Swarmfest 2008 had special focus areas on agent based modeling in Systems Biology, and the implementation of agent based models in high-performance computing environments. Between 2009 and 2012, SwarmFest was held at the Santa Fe Complex in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Swarmfest 2013 was held at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida July 8–9.; SwarmFest 2014 was held at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, IN from June 29 – July 1, 2014; the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC (in 2015), the University of Vermont in Burlington, VT (in 2016), and Old Dominion University in Suffolk, VA (in 2017), were the selected venues.\n\n"}

As Ingold has described the term: \"just as the landscape is an array of related features, so – by analogy – the taskscape is an array of related activities.\" Taskscape, then is a socially constructed space of human activity, understood as having spatial boundaries and delimitations for the purposes of analysis. Of key importance, is that \"taskscape\" as well as \"landscape\", is to be considered as perpetually in process rather than in a static or otherwise immutable state. A taskscape is typically analyzed via five factors: mobility, habitat, economy, nature, and public space.\n\nTim Ingold coined the term in his 1993 article defining the spatial and temporal dimensions of the landscape in human life. He considers it as a methodological structure and analyses the temporality of the landscape in Pieter Bruegel's famous painting, \"The Harvesters\".\n\n\n"}

Until his death he was the Treasurer General of the ANC and also its Member of Parliament.\n\nThomas Titus Nkobi (\"Comrade T.G.\") was born on 22 October 1922 in Plumtree, Matabeleland South, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He grew up and was educated in South Africa, where his father was working in the mines as a migrant labourer. He was at Adams College of Education in KwaZulu Natal with Joshua Nkomo, the Zimbabwean Vice-President and Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance and Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle, the Prime Minister of Lesotho. After completing High School in Natal he matriculated from Bantu High School (later Madibane High School) in Western Township, Johannesburg in 1946 and went to Roma College (now National University of Lesotho) in Lesotho, pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce degree.\n\nHis initial political involvement against the Apartheid regime started in 1944 during the Alexandra bus boycott, a non-violent protest campaign. In 1950 he formally joined the ANC and played a leading role in the 1952 ANC Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws. He was one of the main volunteers who travelled from village to village collecting demands of the African population that were incorporated into the ANC Freedom Charter; he attended the 1955 Congress of the People in Kliptown that drew up the Freedom Charter as a delegate from Alexandra.\n\nIn 1957 Thomas Nkobi shot to prominence when he chaired the Second Alexandra Peoples Transport Committee which was co-ordinating a bus boycott in the Johannesburg and Pretoria townships following a 25 per cent increase in bus fares. In the same year he was arrested for participating in the nationwide South African Potato Boycott, following The Farm Labour Scandal, a journalistic investigation by Ruth First and Joe Gqabi, which uncovered that Africans arrested for infringement of the pass laws were coerced into enforced labour on potato farms. In 1958 Thomas Nkobi became the National Organizer of the ANC and was charged with the task of implementing the M-Plan, an action plan, named after Nelson Mandela, to decentralise the ANCs organizational branches and communication channels to avoid public meetings and announcements and increase effectiveness of their political and social campaign.\n\nDuring the 1960 State of Emergency, he was amongst the thousands of political activists who were detained. After his release he continued working for the ANC as National Organizer and was also prominent in the underground. He was banned in 1961, and in 1962 placed under a 24-hour house arrest. In 1963 Thomas Nkobi fled South Africa for exile in Dar es Salaam / Tanzania and later Lusaka / Zambia, where he became actively involved in mobilising international public opinion against the Apartheid regime.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973 he served as deputy to then Treasurer General of the ANC, Moses Kotane. He was elected Treasurer General of the ANC in 1973, a post to which he was re-elected at all subsequent national conferences of the organisation.\n\nAfter the ANC was in legalised in 1990 he returned to South Africa. There he oversaw the ANCs budget for South Africa's first democratic election, which brought the ANC to power. Thomas Nkobi was re-elected as Treasurer General in party elections in 1991 and also elected as Member of Parliament, member of the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) and member of the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC); one of several elders with moderate views who retained leadership positions.\n\nHe died on 25 September 1994, in Johannesburg after suffering a fatal stroke. He is buried at Heroes' Acre in Soweto, a section of Soweto's Avalon Cemetery reserved as final resting place for many Anti-Apartheid activists.\n\nIn 2004, Thomas Nkobi posthumously received the Order of Luthuli in Gold for his \"exceptional and selfless contribution to the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist, free and democratic South Africa\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is now considered by the AOU as the nominate subspecies of the crowned woodnymph.\n\nThe violet-crowned woodnymph is a common to abundant bird of wet lowlands and foothills to 2500 m, and may move higher when not breeding. The female violet-crowned woodnymph is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a plant-fibre cup nest 1–5 m high on a horizontal branch. Incubation takes 15–19 days, and fledging another 20-26.\n\nThe adult male violet-crowned woodnymph is 10.2 cm long and weighs 4.5 g. It has a violet crown, upper back, shoulders and belly, a shiny green throat and breast, green lower back, and a deeply forked blue-black tail. The female is 8.4–9 cm long and weighs 3.5 g. She is bright green above and duller green below, with a grey throat and breast. Her tail is rounded, mainly green near the body but with a blue-black lower half and white corners. Young males lack any violet or iridescence and are bronze-coloured below. Immature females have buff fringes on the feathers of the nape, face and rump. The call is a high-pitched fast \"kip\".\nThe food of this species is nectar, taken from a variety of flowers. Males feed in the canopy, where their food plants include epiphytic Ericaceae and bromeliads, and defend flowers and scrubs in their feeding territories. Females stay in the understory. After breeding, both sexes may concentrate at \"Heliconias\". Like other hummingbirds, violet-crowned woodnymph also takes small insects and spiders as an essential source of protein.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52465506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52465506", "title": "Women's Business Ownership Act", "text": "Women's Business Ownership Act\n\nThe Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 was an act introduced by John LaFalce aimed at aiding the success of women business entrepreneurs. It provides a basis for policies, programs, and public/private sector initiatives supporting women's business endeavors. The bill was signed into law on October 25, 1988. For much of history, women were excluded from the business world, but now women are becoming entrepreneurs at a fast rate. The market contains many inequities that influence the success women in business are able to achieve. Sexual stereotyping and past societal barriers result in women not having the same access to ownership or control. The Women's Business Ownership Act was drafted in response to the Small Business Committee's series of six hearings on problems facing women entrepreneurs and follows the recommendations outlined in the Committee report \"New Economic Realities: The Rise of Women Entrepreneurs.\" Its intention is to promote equality within business opportunities for women.\n\nThe Congressional Committee identified four barriers to women owned businesses that they wished to address.\nThese findings were included in the Committee Report 100-736, which was filed on June 28, 1988. Findings like this are critical in order to formulate the basis for public policies and programs in order to benefit women entrepreneurs.\n\n\nThe Women's Business Ownership Act provided seed funding for women's business centers through an annual grant process by the Small Business Administration. They were intended to provide technical assistance to women in order to form businesses, particularly those who were socially or economically disadvantaged. Women's business centers provide training, technical assistance, and support for entrepreneurship for women. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research project has consistently shown that women have lower entrepreneurship endeavors than men, but research on women's business centers indicate that the centers in the United States are accomplishing their intended mission.\n\nWomen lack equal access to education, finance, and other support services, such as business networks. Women often also have to pay higher interest rates than men for similar loans. In addition to these logistical factors, women are often influenced by societal norms, such as being unlikely to be exposed to the concept of negotiation. The lack of resources for women entrepreneurs in daily assistance in the beginning stages of their businesses make it difficult for women to start businesses. As a result, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to stay in business for only short periods of time. Women’s Business Centers seek to offer assistance with the day-to-day operations of starting a business, hoping to help women overcome the barriers they face to entrepreneurship.\n\nSince 1995, the Center for Women in Business Enterprise in Boston and Worcester have helped over 14,000 entrepreneurs. This is indicative of the demand for such services. Women's Business Center Program has had significant economic impact, with more than one half of the Centers showing growth in number of clients helped, gross receipts, profits, the creation of jobs, and new firms started.\n\nCreated by the Women's Business Ownership Act, the National Women's Business Council is a non-partisan federal advisory board created to present policy advice about women small business issues to the President and Congress. It has resulted in the Census Bureau being required to include women business owners in its census survey.\n\nEstablished in 1988, it started as an advisory board intended to identify the barriers for women-owned businesses and report annually to the president and Congress. By the early 1990s, the National Women's Business Council included women business owners, policy makers, bankers, and representatives of women's business organizations in the discussion of potential solutions to the problems women-owned businesses face, which were then presented to the president and Congress. The Small Business Reauthorization Act changed the structure of the National Women's Business Council in 1994 to its current form, which includes women business owners and representatives of women's business organizations. The law was expanded in 1998 for the National Women's Business council to include the current fifteen members.\n\nThe members of the National Women's Business Council are appointed to three year terms. The fifteen members include:\n\nWhite women working on the legislation for the Women’s Business Ownership Act were concerned that adding amendments for women of color would make the bill too controversial to pass or “putting race and sex together in the same legislation complicates the issue and might threaten the passage of the legislation.” This concern indicates the marginalization that women face, but also the additional barriers for women of color.\n\nThe National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) was a main proponent for the passing of the bill. NAWBO argued that stereotypes of women created barriers to women business owners. However, NAWBO was hesitant to include women of color to its ranks. They were nervous that, due to the political climate of the time, adding a racial component to what was already considered progressive legislation intended to address women’s issues would provoke push back from conservatives. The coalition eventually was convinced that it was important to include women of color because their interests could be addressed by NAWBO without also involving the community of minority men business owners. A small sub-coalition was created, which consisted of the Organization of Pan Asian American Women, the Black Women’s Agenda, and the Coalition of Minority Women in Business.\n\nProcesses that are racialized and affect entrepreneurship are often gendered and classed as well. Residential segregation, racialized social networks, and wealth inequality influence blacks’ entrepreneurial behavior by reducing their access to resources necessary to start businesses. These aspects are also influenced by gender and class. As of 2015, only about 5% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women, and the majority are white. On average for full-time work, a white man will earn almost 56% more than a black woman. Black entrepreneurs understand their business ownership within a context of race, but also within the context of other social groups, like gender.\n\nInitially, women’s interest groups were accused of representing only middle- and upper-middle-class women when selecting issues to politically address. However, the interests of working class and poor women have received increased attention. Measures implemented by the Women’s Business Ownership Act, such as the Women's Business Centers, were intentionally implemented for women of lower socioeconomic status.\n\nAffirmative action programs are often used as a way to make the playing field equal for minority and women owned businesses, and can contribute to the ability for business entry and survival. These programs for women can be considered in terms of education, employment, and business ownership. For women business owners, affirmative action programs are considered legislation that encourage government agencies and contractors to do business with women-owned businesses. Programs that provide financial, management, and technical assistance to women business owners are also considered to be aspects of affirmative action. Affirmative action legislation has led to substantial improvements in the employment of minorities and women. While affirmative action independently is not enough to provide opportunities to those facing discrimination or marginalization, evidence suggests that it is beneficial in helping women and minorities to attain more education or economic gains. Ronald Reagan's administration from 1981 to 1989, or during the passage of the Women's Business Ownership Act, was adamantly opposed to affirmative action. There was a concern that the heavy opposition undermined the effectiveness of the policies.\n\nResearch conducted after the abolition of affirmative action in Washington and California found evidence to suggest there were slight increases in self-employment among minorities and women with no affirmative action. This is believed to be due to the opportunity cost of starting a business falling because of the restricting opportunities in a traditional labor market. However, this may not be true when considering different race and gender groups.\n"}
