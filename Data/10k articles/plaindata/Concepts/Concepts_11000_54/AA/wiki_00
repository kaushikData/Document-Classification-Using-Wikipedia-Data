More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot. Organised by the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and backed by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the plot is thought to have targeted the England–Tunisia match on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in Paris hosting the United States national team, and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers.\n\nThe original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian Farid Melouk, who had previously been sentenced \"in absentia\" to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings. Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into Belgium, where he was found to be in contact with Ahmed Zaoui and a GIA-linked Brussels mosque. On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot. Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium. Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a Kalashnikov rifle, several handguns and thousands worth of US dollars in cash. In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved. More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.\n\nThe March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom. Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief. Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder. In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom. \n\nOn 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander Hassan Hattab were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, Lyon and Corsica; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported. Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained. French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup. Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms. Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks. According to counter-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière, the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.\n\nThe plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June. Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters David Beckham and Michael Owen), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands. Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there. The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a nuclear meltdown.\n\nThe details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including FA staff. In 2009, England manager in 1998 Glenn Hoddle revealed that he had only been informed of the plot \"years later\", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 David Davies said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes. The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.\n\nAlthough organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. According to bin Laden biographer Yossef Bodansky, the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for \"dormant terrorist networks\" responsible for the August 1998 United States embassy bombings being \"reactivated\". The attacks killed over 200 and wounded more than 4,000.\n\nA terror plot against the UEFA Euro 2000 was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons. Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands. One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.\n\nThe night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the Stade de France. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals. The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.\n\n"}

{"id": "25013243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25013243", "title": "Araucaria (software)", "text": "Araucaria (software)\n\nAraucaria is an argument mapping software tool developed in 2001 by Chris Reed and Glenn Rowe, in the Argumentation Research Group at the School of Computing in the University of Dundee, Scotland. It is designed to visually represent arguments through diagrams that can be used for analysis and stored in Argument Markup Language (AML), based on XML. As a free software, it is available under the GNU General Public License and may be downloaded for free on the internet.\n\nThe user interface is composed of a main window (diagramming), a schemes editor and the AraucariaDB online interface.\n\nWhen a text file is loaded into the program, the text is displayed in the left-hand panel of the main window. Highlighting portions of text before clicking on the right (larger) panel creates corresponding nodes at the bottom of that panel. Nodes can then be paired together by dragging one (which will be the premise) to the other (the conclusion). \nTo each node may be attached a value such as the ownership of the proposition, or an evaluation specifying the degree of confidence placed in premise. Similarly, symbols can be added to the arrows to state the strength of the inference. In addition, the user may link arguments, supply missing premises (argument reconstruction) and use refutations. \nThe diagram will always take the form of a tree structure in Araucaria. The user has the choice of translating the argument into standard diagram, Toulmin diagram or Wigmore diagram, Araucaria 3.1 being the first software to integrate the latter ontology and to address the translation issues between the different diagrams.\n\nWhile Araucaria helps identify the structure of an argument, it provides freedom of analysis resources. The scheme editor allows the user to create argumentation schemes, group them together and save them into a scheme set file. The scheme set is then applied to the diagram, entirely or in part. As an illustration, an argument scheme relying on symptoms could be applied to the following assertion: \"The light has gone off. Therefore, the bulb must be broken\", with critical questions intended to determine if the result could stem from another reason (such as \"have all the lights in the flat gone off?\").\n\nThe AraucariaDB Online Repository can be browsed to retrieve specific arguments to fit a diagram. Alternatively, an argument diagram, along with annotations, can be saved into the database.\n\nAraucaria was developed in Java in order to be supported on most platforms. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License and complies with free software standards.\nArgument Markup Language (AML) was created to maintain the evolving relationship between text and diagram. To this end, tags are added to the text and specify the connection between each component. AML is designed to be an application of argumentation theory in artificial intelligence.\n\nBecause it is based on XML, a standard widely used by developers, AML content can be accessed through other software that support XML. Likewise, AML data is easily available online after using style sheets to create HTML web pages.\n\nAraucaria itself is conceived to be compatible with other tools. One example of integration is the argumentation software library Argkit. The online corpus provision\nis an extension of the Araucaria project. Further integration is planned with other applications currently under development.\n\nThe software is aimed at providing both a pedagogical tool (enhancing the teaching of critical thinking skills thanks to diagramming) and a support for research within the fields of argumentation theory and informal logic. In addition, it fits professional purposes, as it reduces the time needed to process data.\n\nAmong the choices of diagram available to the user, Wigmore charts were intended to be used for legal case analysis. Argument mapping tools are particularly suited to professionals and scholars in the legal field who have a considerable amount of arguments required to be processed in a consistent manner. Araucaria has been used by magistrates in Ontario Courts to help with a large volume of relatively simple cases.\n\nThe advantages of using Araucaria in both learning and teaching philosophy was considered by the program's authors, along with other scholars, in a paper published in 2006. They emphasized how much easier it is to explain and summarize philosophers' theories when arguments are visualized in a diagram. A qualitative survey was carried out among students revealing positive results.\n\nAraucaria is similar to other pre-existing software in some of its applications. However, the authors' intention was to \"fill a gap\" in providing a tool able to \"support both teaching and research in argumentation theory\".\n\nAs of mid-2009, Araucaria is deemed to have approximately 10,000 users, even though that is hard to assess with precision when it comes to software available for free on the internet. IP address logs show that the user base is very wide both on a geographical level (more than 40 countries) and on a sectoral level (range of domains including doctors, statisticians, lawyers and engineers).\n\nWhile Araucaria is arguably one of the most sophisticated diagramming software packages and enjoys an important user base, its interface and features may be viewed as outdated. According to Chris Reed, \"a large-scale rewrite is underway, which provides AIF support\".\nIt is unknown if this rewrite will be the occasion to turn Araucaria into an online and/or collaborative program. An online tool supporting AIF, albeit with less comprehensive features, was recently developed by Reed's research group (ARG:dundee). An alpha version of this Online Visualisation of Argument (OVA) is available.\n\nIn addition, one of Reed's long-time projects had been to tackle the limitations of computer diagramming induced by natural language interpretation, and to add a dialogic argumentation structure to the software. From October 2009 to March 2013, a research program called \"Dialectical Argumentation Machines\" is attempted to make a first step towards this objective.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bliss (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the United States, it was more commonly adopted by British libraries. A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.\n\nHenry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the City College of New York Library as Assistant Librarian. He was a critic of Melvil Dewey's work with the Dewey Decimal System and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs. Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of \"alternative location,\" in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.\n\nBliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, \"A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives\". This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, \"Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences\" was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.\n\nThe four broad underlying policies of the BC system are: \nBliss deliberately avoided the use of the decimal point because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric typewriter.\n\nIn 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of faceted classification. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.\n\nThe City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the Library of Congress system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.\n\nThe case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers’ colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries. It has also found success in libraries outside of the United States of America, as many of these libraries do not have a history of using either the Dewey Decimal, or the Library of Congress classification system.\n\nThe Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries.

{"id": "12198880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12198880", "title": "Broken heart", "text": "Broken heart\n\nBroken heart (also known as a heartbreak or heartache) is a metaphor for the intense emotional—and sometimes physical—stress or pain one feels at experiencing great longing. The concept is cross-cultural, often cited with reference to a desired or lost lover, and dates back at least 3,000 years.\n\nThe intense pain of a broken heart is believed to be part of the survival instinct. The \"social-attachment system\" uses the \"pain system\" to encourage humans to maintain their close social relationships by causing pain when those relationships are lost. Psychologists Geoff MacDonald of the University of Queensland and Mark Leary of Wake Forest University proposed in 2005 the evolution of common mechanisms for both physical and emotional pain responses and argue that such expressions are \"more than just a metaphor\". The concept is believed to be universal, with many cultures using the same words to describe both physical pain and the feelings associated with relationship loss.\n\nThe neurological process involved in the perception of heartache is not known, but is thought to involve the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain, which during stress may overstimulate the vagus nerve causing pain, nausea or muscle tightness in the chest. Research by Naomi Eisenberger and Matthew Lieberman of the University of California from 2008 showed that rejection is associated with activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and right-ventral pre-frontal cortex, areas established as being involved in processing of pain, including empathizing with pain experienced by others. The same researchers mention effect of social stressors on the heart, and personality on perception of pain.\n\nA 2011 study showed that the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense social rejection or social loss in general. Social psychologist Ethan Kross from University of Michigan, who was heavily involved in the study, said, \"These results give new meaning to the idea that social rejection hurts\". The research implicates the secondary somatosensory cortex and the dorsal posterior insula.\n\nFor most bereaved individuals, the journey through grief will ultimately culminate in an acceptable level of adjustment to a life without their loved one. The Kübler-Ross model postulates that there are five stages of grief after the loss of a loved-one: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And while it is recognized that mourners go through initial period of numbness leading to depression and finally to reorganization and recovery, most modern grief specialists recognize the variations and fluidity of grief experiences differ considerably in intensity and length among cultural groups, individually from person to person as well as depending on the amount of investment put into the relationship.\n\nRuminating, or having intrusive thoughts that are continuous, uncontrollable, and distressing, is often a component of grieving. John Bowlby's concept of searching for the lost object is about the anxiety and mounting frustration as the mourner remains lost, frequently sifting through memories of the departed, and perhaps fleeting perceptions of spectral visitations by the lost individual. When the loss involves 'being left' or 'unrequited love', in addition to the above, this mental searching is accompanied by obsessive thoughts about factors leading to the breakup, and possibilities for reuniting with the lost individual. When rejection is involved, shame may also be involved – the painful feeling of being inherently unacceptable, disposable, unworthy.\n\nThe physical signs of grieving include:\n\nA broken heart is a major stressor and has been found to precipitate episodes of major depression. In one study (death of a spouse), 24% of mourners were depressed at two months, 23% at seven months, 16% at 13 months and 14% at 25 months.\n\nAlthough there are overlapping symptoms, uncomplicated grief can be distinguished from a full depressive episode. Major depression tends to be more pervasive and is characterized by significant difficulty in experiencing self-validating and positive feelings. Major depression is composed of a recognizable and stable cluster of debilitating symptoms, accompanied by a protracted, enduring low mood. It tends to be persistent and associated with poor work and social functioning, pathological immunological function, and other neurobiological changes, unless treated.\n\nIn relationship breakups, mourners may turn their anger about the rejection toward themselves. This can deepen the depression and cause narcissistic wounding. The process of self-attack can range from mild self-doubt to scathing self recrimination which leaves a lasting imprint on individuals' self-worth, and causes them to doubt their lovability, personality-efficacy, and attachment worthiness going forward.\n\nIn severe cases, the depression of a broken heart can create a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma which can be severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection. A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' can trigger primal separation fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one's vital needs.\n\nMourners may also experience the intense stress of helplessness. If they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they will feel helpless and inadequate to the task. Feeling one's 'limited capacity' can produce a fault line in the psyche which renders the person prone to heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing someone with whom the mourner has come to rely in ways they did not realize. For instance, in time, couples can become external regulators for one another, attuned on many levels: pupils dilated in synchrony, echoing one another's speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms. Couples can function like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other's bio rhythms, responding to one another's pheromones, and be addictive due to the steady trickle of endogenous opiates induced by the relationship.\n\nResearch has shown that in extreme cases, some who experience a broken heart go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nThere are various predisposing psycho-biological and environmental factors that go into determining whether one's earlier emotional trauma might lead to the development of a true clinical picture of posttraumatic stress disorder. This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence more prone to becoming posttraumatic.\n\nAnother factor is that insecure attachments in childhood have shown to predispose the individuals to difficulties in forming secure attachments in adulthood and to having heightened responses to rejection and loss.\n\nThere is also variation in individuals' neurochemical systems that govern the stress regulation. Depending on the severity of the stress response induced in an individual by an event (i.e. a romantic breakup), certain concentrations of stress hormones including CRF, ACTH, and cortisol work to intensify the imprinting of an emotional memory of the event, indelibly inscribing its fears and other sensations in the amygdala (to serve as a warning for future events), while the same stress hormones can act to impede.\n\nIn many legends and fictional tales, characters die after suffering a devastating loss; however, even in reality people die from what appears to be a broken heart. \"Broken heart syndrome\" is commonly described as a physical pain in the heart or chest area, which is due to the emotional stress caused by a traumatic breakup or the death of a loved one.\n\nBroken heart syndrome mimics symptoms of a heart attack, but it is clinically different from a heart attack because the patients have few risk factors for heart disease and were previously healthy prior to the heart muscles weakening. Some echocardiograms expressed how the left ventricle, of people with the broken heart syndrome, was contracting normally but the middle and upper sides of the heart muscle had weaker contractions due to inverted T waves and longer Q-T intervals that are associated with stress. Magnetic resonance images suggested that the recovery rates for those suffering from broken heart syndrome are faster than those who had heart attacks and complete recovery to the heart is achieved within two months.\n\nPhysiological and biochemical changes that contribute to higher physical illnesses and heart diseases have been found in individuals that have high levels of anxiety and depression. Some individuals who have divorced have compromised immune systems because of inflammatory cytokines followed by a state of depression.\n\nBiblical references to the pain of a broken heart date back to 1015 BC.\n\nRudaki, regarded as the first great genius of Persian poetry, used broken heart imagery in his writing.\n\nShakespeare's play \"Antony and Cleopatra\" features a character, Enobarbus, who dies of a broken heart after betraying a friend. Lady Montague dies of a broken heart after the banishment of her son in \"Romeo and Juliet\".\n\nFrida Kahlo's 1937 painting \"Memory, the Heart\" portrays the artist's heartbreak during and after an affair between her husband and her sister.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first coined by G. Gregory Smith in his 1919 book \"Scottish Literature: Character and Influence\" in which he wrote:\nthe literature [of Scotland] is the literature of a small country... it runs a shorter course than others... in this shortness and cohesion the most favourable conditions seem to be offered for a making of a general estimate. But on the other hand, we find at closer scanning that the cohesion at least in formal expression and in choice of material is only apparent, that the literature is remarkably varied, and that it becomes, under the stress of foreign influence, almost a zigzag of contradictions. The antithesis need not, however, disconcert us. Perhaps in the very combination of opposites—what either of the two Thomases, of Norwich and Cromarty, might have been willing to call \"the Caledonian antisyzygy\"—we have a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered. If therefore, Scottish history and life are, as an old northern writer said of something else, 'varied with a clean contrair spirit', we need not be surprised to find that in his literature the Scot presents two aspects which appear contradictory. Oxymoron was ever the bravest figure, and we must not forget that disorderly order is order after all.\n\nThe poet Hugh MacDiarmid elaborated on the concept in his essay, \"The Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Gaelic Idea\", published in two parts in \"The Modern Scot\" 1931–1932. The notion is most frequently cited in reference to the seemingly morally contradictory quality of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson (\"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\") and James Hogg (\"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\"), but is also applied to contrasts between the Highlands and the Lowlands, Protestantism and Catholicism, Britishness and Scottishness, and others.\n\n"}

Kennedy presented a speech to the United States Congress in which he extolled four basic consumer rights, later called the Consumer Bill of Rights. The United Nations through the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection expanded these into eight rights, and thereafter Consumers International adopted these rights as a charter and started recognizing March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day.\n\nBefore the mid-twentieth century, consumers had limited rights with regard to their interaction with products and commercial producers. Consumers had limited ground on which to defend themselves against faulty or defective products, or against misleading or deceptive advertising methods.\n\nThe consumer movement began to gather a following, pushing for increased rights and legal protection against malicious business practices. By the end of the 1950s, legal product liability had been established in which an aggrieved party need only prove injury by use of a product, rather than bearing the burden of proof of corporate negligence.\n\nHelen Ewing Nelson was a drafter of the Consumer Bill of Rights and sought an outlet for distributing it. During Kennedy's election campaign he made a promise to support consumers. After his election, Fred Dutton, a colleague of Nelson's and a government officer who advised the president, asked for Nelson's suggestions on how the president could support consumers, and she sent him the Consumer Bill of Rights. Kennedy presented those rights in a speech to Congress on March 15, 1962. In that speech he named four basic rights of consumers.\n\nThe assertion of this right is aimed at the defense of consumers against injuries caused by products other than automobile vehicles, and implies that products should cause no harm to their users if such use is executed as prescribed. The right was further formalized in 1972 by the US federal government through the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). This organization has jurisdiction over thousands of commercial products, and powers that allow it to establish performance standards and require product testing and warning labels.\n\nThis right states that businesses should always provide consumers with enough appropriate information to make intelligent and informed product choices. Product information provided by a business should always be complete and truthful. Aiming to achieve protection against misleading information in the areas of financing, advertising, labeling, and packaging, the right to be informed is protected by several pieces of legislation passed between 1960 and 1980.\n\nSome of the legislation which was made because of the assertion of this right include the following:\n\nThe right to free choice among product offerings states that consumers should have a variety of options provided by different companies from which to choose. The federal government has taken many steps to ensure the availability of a healthy environment open to competition through legislation including limits on concept ownership through patent law, prevention of monopolistic business practices through anti-trust legislation, and the outlaw of price cutting and gouging.\n\nThis right has the ability of consumers to voice complaints and concerns about a product in order to have the issue handled efficiently and responsively. While no federal agency is tasked with the specific duty of providing a forum for this interaction between consumer and producer, certain outlets exist to aid consumers if difficulty occurs in communication with an aggrieving party. State and federal attorneys general are equipped to aid their constituents in dealing with parties who have provided a product or service in a manner unsatisfactory to the consumer in violation of an applicable law. Also, the Better Business Bureau is a national non-governmental organization whose sole agenda is to provide political lobbies and action on behalf of aggrieved consumers.\n\nIn 1985, the concept of consumer rights was endorsed by the United Nations through the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection, which expands them to include eight basic rights.\n\nThis right demands that people have access to basic, essential goods and services: adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water, and sanitation\n\nThe right to redress provides for consumers to receive a fair settlement of just claims, including compensation for misrepresentation, shoddy goods, or unsatisfactory services. For example, a consumer should be able to go to consumer court against mobile phone companies that put hidden charges on the bill that were not previously explained, or activate ringtones without the consumer's permission.\n\nThe right to consumer education states that consumers should be able to acquire knowledge and skills needed to make informed, confident choices about goods and services, while being aware of basic consumer rights and responsibilities and how to act on them.\n\nThis is the right to live and work in a work space or home that is non-threatening to the well-being of present and future generations.\n\nThe NGO Consumers International adopted the eight rights and restated them as a charter. Subsequently, the organization began recognizing the date of Kennedy's speech, March 15, as World Consumer Rights Day.\n\nAs of May 2014, the UK Government has introduced proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the \"Consumer Rights Bill\", and it will consolidate and develop Unfair Contract Terms provisions and Consumer Protection provisions.\n\n"}

The concept of demand was developed by Lacan in parallel to those of need and desire to account for the role of speech on human aspirations. Demand forms part of Lacan's battle against the approach to language acquisition favored by ego psychology, and makes use of Kojeve's theory of desire. Demand is not a Freudian concept.\n\nFor Lacan, demand is the result of language acquisition on physical needs - the individual's wants are automatically filtered through the alien system of external signifiers.\n\nWhere traditionally psychoanalysis had recognised that learning to speak was a major step in the ego's acquisition of power over the world, and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control, Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language.\n\nHe argued that \"demand constitutes the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs\", and that indeed the child's biological needs are themselves altered by \"the condition that is imposed on him by the existence of the discourse, to make his need pass through the defiles of the signifier\". Thus even in speaking one's demands, the latter are altered; and even when they are met, the child finds that it no longer wants what it thought it wanted.\n\nIn Lacanian thought, a demand results when a lack in the Real is transformed into the Symbolic medium of language. Demands faithfully express unconscious signifying formations, but always leave behind\na residue or kernel of desire, representing a lost surplus of jouissance for the subject, (because the Real is never totally symbolizable).\n\nAs a result, for Lacan, \"desire is situated in dependence on demand - which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a metonymic remainder which runs under it\". The frustration inherent in demand - whatever is actually asked for is 'not it' - is what gives rise to desire.\n\nThe demands of human society are initially mediated via the Mother; with the discourse of whom the infant comes to identify, subsuming its own non-verbal self-expression.\n\nThe result in the neurotic may be a dominance of parental demand, and of the social objects valued by such demands - jobs, degrees, marriage, success, money and the like. Lacan considered indeed that for the neurotic \"the demand of the Other assumes the function of an object in his phantasy...this prevalence given by the neurotic to demand\".\n\nLacan considered that the transference appears in the forms of demands from the patient - demands which he stressed the analyst must resist.\n\nThrough such demands, he states, \"the whole past opens up right down to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, and...regression shows nothing other than a return to the present of signifiers used in demands\".\n\nFrançois Roustang however has challenged the Lacanian view, arguing that the patient's demand, rather than undermining the analysis, may be a positive attempt to get the analyst to shift their therapeutic stance.\n"}

Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the \"elite\" are \"those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type.\" \nAmerican sociologist C. Wright Mills wrote of the \"elite\" in his 1957 book \"The Power Elite\" as \"those political, economic, and military circles, which as an intricate set of overlapping small but dominant groups share decisions having at least national consequences. Insofar as national events are decided, the power elite are those who decide them\". Mills states that the power elite members recognize other members' mutual exalted position in society. \"As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'.\" \"It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role. Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as Harvard, Columbia, Yale, and Princeton, but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts\".\n\nAccording to Mills, men receive the education necessary for elitist privilege to obtain their background and contacts, allowing them to enter three branches of the power elite, which are;\n\nAccording to Mills, the governing elite in the United States primarily draws its members from political leaders, including the president, and a handful of key cabinet members, as well as close advisers, major corporate owners and directors, and high-ranking military officers. These groups overlap and elites tend to circulate from one sector to another, consolidating power in the process.\n\nUnlike the ruling class, a social formation based on heritage and social ties, the power elite is characterized by the organizational structures through which its wealth is acquired. According to Mills, the power elite rose from \"the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich\". Domhoff further clarified the differences in the two terms: \"The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of organizations and institutions...Leaders within the upper class join with high-level employees in the organizations they control to make up what will be called the power elite\".\n\nThe Marxist theoretician Nikolai Bukharin anticipated the elite theory in his 1929 work, \"Imperialism and World Economy\": \"present-day state power is nothing but an entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate offices\".\n\nThe \"power elite\" is a term used by American sociologist C. Wright Mills to describe a relatively small, loosely connected group of individuals who dominate American policy making. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, media, and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.\n\nThe basis for membership of a power elite is institutional power, namely an influential position within a prominent private or public organization. A study of the French corporate elite has shown that social class continues to hold sway in determining who joins this elite group, with those from the upper-middle class tending to dominate. Another study (published in 2002) of power elites in the United States under President George W. Bush (in office 2001-2009) identified 7,314 institutional positions of power encompassing 5,778 individuals. A later study of U.S. society noted demographic characteristics of this elite group as follows:\n\n\nIn the 1970s an organized set of policies promoted reduced taxes, especially for the wealthy, and a steady erosion of the welfare safety net. Starting with legislation in the 1980s, the wealthy banking community successfully lobbied for reduced regulation. The wide range of financial and social capital accessible to the power elite gives their members heavy influence in economic and political decision making, allowing them to move toward attaining desired outcomes. Sociologist Christopher Doob gives a hypothetical alternative, stating that these elite individuals would consider themselves the overseers of the national economy. Also appreciating that it is not only a moral, but a practical necessity to focus beyond their group interests. Doing so would hopefully alleviate various destructive conditions affecting large numbers of less affluent citizens.\n\nMills determined that there is an \"inner core\" of the power elite involving individuals that are able to move from one seat of institutional power to another. They therefore, have a wide range of knowledge and interests in many influential organizations, and are, as Mills describes, \"professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs\". Relentless expansion of capitalism and the globalizing of economic and military power, binds leaders of the power elite into complex relationships with nation states that generate global-scale class divisions. Sociologist Manuel Castells writes in \"The Rise of the Network Society\" that contemporary globalization does not mean that \"everything in the global economy is global\". So, a global economy becomes characterized by fundamental social inequalities with respect to the \"level of integration, competitive potential and share of the benefits from economic growth\". Castells cites a kind of \"double movement\" where on one hand, \"valuable segments of territories and people\" become \"linked in the global networks of value making and wealth appropriation\", while, on the other, \"everything and everyone\" that is not valued by established networks gets \"switched off...and ultimately discarded\". The wide-ranging effects of global capitalism ultimately affect everyone on the planet, as economies around the world come to depend on the functioning of global financial markets, technologies, trade and labor.\n\n\n\n"}

They belong to the 'M' lineage of \"Apis mellifera\". They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues (5.7-6.4mm) and traditionally were called the German Dark Bee, a name still used today but ironically they are now considered an Endangered Breed in Germany. Their common name is derived from their brown-black color, with only a few lighter yellow spots on the abdomen. However today they are more likely to be called after the geographic / political region in which they live such as the British Black Bee, the Native Irish Honey Bee, the Cornish Black Bee and the Nordic Brown Bee, even though they are all the same subspecie, with the word \"native\" often being added by local beekeepers, even if the bee was introduced. It was domesticated in Europe and hives were brought to North America in the colonial era, where they were referred to as the English Fly by the native american indians.\n\nThe A. m. mellifera can be distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. Overall, when viewed from a distance, they should appear blackish, or in \"mellifera\", rich dark brown. For breeding pure A. m. mellifera details of the wing veins (wing morphometry) are still considered to be a reliable distinguishing character, although it has now been established that the formation of wing veins are influenced by temperatures that capped brood are exposed to.\n\nThe \"A. m. mellifera\" is descended from the M lineage of \"Apis mellifera\", of which all bees to a greater or lesser degree have a strongly defensive instinct (from the point of view of the bee) or strong aggression (from the point of view of the beekeeper), especially when compared to the C lineage.\n\"A. m. mellifera\" hybrids have an even greater reputation of aggression amongst beekeepers, which can increase in subsequent generations, if left unchecked, although this characteristic can be overcome with continual selective breeding over some generations. They are nervous and aggressive to the extent that routine inspections will take longer, decreasing the enjoyment of managing their colonies. This characteristic is one that has been traditionally associated with \"A. m. mellifera\" going back to the old British Black bee before the early 1900's: To quote Brother Adam who had first hand experience, \"The native (British Black) bee had undoubtedly many extremely valuable characteristics, but equally so a great many serious defects and drawbacks. She was very bad tempered and very susceptible to brood diseases and would in any case not have been able to produce the crops (of honey) we have secured since her demise\".\n\n\n\"Apis mellifera mellifera\" is no longer a significant commercial subspecies of the Western honey bee, but there are a number of dedicated hobbyist beekeepers that keep these bees in northern and central Europe. Immigrants brought these subspecies into the Americas. Prior to their arrival, the American continent did not have any honey bees.\nIn north western Europe, \"A. m. mellifera\" were the original honey bee stock until creation of the \"Buckfast bee\" a breed of bee whose progeny originally included the remnants of the old British black bee (\"A. m. mellifera\"), which became extinct due to the \"Acarapis woodi\" (acarine mite).\n\nIn the United States, research based on DNA sequencing analysis found DNA from the 'M' lineage of honey bees in the feral population of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Missouri, believed in part to be the DNA from imported bees of over 100 years ago (DNA from the other bee lineages was also found in these feral populations, suggesting that they likely came from escaped swarms from apiaries at unknown times in the past).\n\nDedicated organizations are today working on establishing conservation areas for the \"A. m. mellifera\", like the \"A. m. mellifera Santuary in Colonsay & Oronsay\" in Scotland, while breeding groups have been set up to \"establish racial purity\" of \"native strains\" and others running courses to train beekeepers in being able to calculate the \"racial purity\" of their bees through \"wing morphometry\". Other organizations are attempting to establish that the \"A. m. mellifera\" in their local geographic region are a distinct \"variety\", some even claiming it is a separate subspecies from that of \"A. m. mellifera\" in northern Europe, but to date no published research has been able to show this, however through morphometry and DNA analysis local geographic strains may be able to be identified, albiet not consistent across the geographic population, in which the strain's characteristics show less morphometric variation and therefore less environmental adaptability. With one group even starting a \"project to develop their \"own native\" breed of bee\". Even though DNA analysis has been able to show that the amount of non-\"A. m. mellifera\" DNA within local populations of \"A. m. mellifera\" remains relatively low, with an Irish survey showing that \"97.8% of sampled bees were determined to be pure \"A. m. mellifera\"\", a further study across eight northwest European countries showed that their \"A. m. mellifera\" poulations were genetically pure.\n\nIn the documentary More than Honey the bee kept and bred by Swiss (German) beekeeper Herr. Fred Jaggi was the \"A. m. mellifera\", referred to as the \"local black breed\", in which he strives to maintain \"racially pure\" bees, lamenting when he discovers yellow coloration in the colony of one of his queens, meaning that she has bred with a drone from a different subspecie and produced \"little half-breeds\", she is subsequently killed; we see in the documentary his pure bees succumbing to a brood disease and having to be gassed then burned: Herr. Jaggi abandons the local black bees and the goal of racial purity, choosing \"A. m. carnica\" bees instead, with an apiary that includes hybrids to enhance genetic diversity.\n\nIn 2012 a story began to circulate online and in some British newspapers (in which Dorian Pritchard the Conservation officer for BIBBA and President of SICAMM was interviewed and quoted) that the Old British Black Bee (\"A. m. mellifera\") was not extinct and had been discovered in the rafters of a church in Northumberland, there were numerous inaccuracies in the story, including: 1) The \"British Black\" bee was \"wiped out by a strain of Spanish flu in 1919\"; the Spanish flu only affected humans, it was the Isle of Wight Disease between 1904 through to 1945 that wiped out the \"original\" Old British (and Irish) Black Bees of the British Isles: 2) \"the Spanish flu which wiped out...every single bee in the UK\", no beekeepers at the time made this claim, what was claimed was that the original pure \"A. m. mellifera\" of the British Isles was wiped out, hybrids with other non-\"A. m. mellifera\" bees often survived, notably the \"A. m. ligustica\" and later the \"Buckfast bee\" bred by Brother Adam of Buckfast Abbey, also continental \"A. m. mellifera\", imported in subsequent years to repopulate the country, showed strong resistance to the \"Isle of Wight Disease\": 3) \"The British Black bee is different from other bees ...ideally suited to the British climate...more so than the European Black bee\", this suggests that the \"British Black Bee\" found in the church is a different subspecie than the \"European Black Bee\" the \"A. m. mellifera\", while in fact they are the same subspecie, as acknowledged by Philip Denwood writing in SICAMM's (\"International Association for the Protection of the European Dark Bee\") magazine \"mellifera.ch \" in 2014 (as a member of BKKA and BIBBA) \"...in the last decade DNA studies... have conclusively shown that modern specimens of Dark Bees from the UK and Ireland fit into the genetic specification of \"Apis mellifera melifera\" (the European dark / black bee)\".\n\n"}

An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.\n\nEvolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor. In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.\n\nStep One: Generate the initial population of individuals randomly. (First generation)\n\nStep Two: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)\n\nStep Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:\n\nSimilar techniques differ in genetic representation and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.\n\nA possible limitation of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear genotype-phenotype distinction. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as embryogenesis to become a mature phenotype. This indirect encoding is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the evolvability of the organism. Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment. Recent work in the field of artificial embryogeny, or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And gene expression programming successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes. \n\nSwarm algorithms include\n\n\nThe computer simulations \"Tierra\" and \"Avida\" attempt to model macroevolutionary dynamics.\n\n"}
{"id": "37232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37232", "title": "Fermat's principle", "text": "Fermat's principle\n\nIn optics, Fermat's principle or the principle of least time, named after French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time. This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light. However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path. In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.\n\nFermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays reflected off mirrors, refracted through different media, or undergoing total internal reflection. It follows mathematically from Huygens' principle (at the limit of small wavelength). Fermat's text \"Analyse des réfractions\" exploits the technique of adequality to derive Snell's law of refraction and the law of reflection.\n\nFermat's principle has the same form as Hamilton's principle and it is the basis of Hamiltonian optics.\n\nThe time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points A and B is given by:\n\n\"c\" is the speed of light in vacuum, \"ds\" an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, \"v\" = \"ds\"/\"dt\" the speed of light in a medium and \"n\" = \"c\"/\"v\" the refractive index of that medium, formula_2 is the starting time (the wave front is in A), formula_3 is the arrival time at B. The optical path length of a ray from a point A to a point B is defined by:\n\nand it is related to the travel time by \"S\" = \"cT\". The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An extremum in the light travel time between two points A and B is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that In the context of calculus of variations this can be written as\n\nIn general, the refractive index is a scalar field of position in space, that is, formula_6 in 3D euclidean space. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the \"x\" axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as formula_7 and\n\nwhere formula_9. The principle of Fermat can now be written as\n\nwhich has the same form as Hamilton's principle but in which \"x\" takes the role of time in classical mechanics. Function formula_12 is the optical Lagrangian from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in Hamiltonian mechanics) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.\n\nClassically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of Huygens' principle. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB will have optical paths differing from AB by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.\n\nFermat's principle is the main principle of quantum electrodynamics which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer. The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.\n\nIn the classic mechanics of waves, Fermat's principle follows from the extremum principle of mechanics (see variational principle).\n\nEuclid, c. 320 BCE in his Catoptrics (on mirrors, including spherical mirrors) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by Ptolemy, and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, Hero of Alexandria (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.\n\nIbn al-Haytham (Alhacen), in his \"Book of Optics\" (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist Ptolemy.\n\nThe generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to Cureau de la Chambre. It was met with objections by Claude Clerselier in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:\n\"... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one. It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.\n\nThe original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:\n\"Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.\"\nAlthough Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as Huygens' principle.\n\nHistorically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see Principle of least action).\n\n"}

The term \"functional\" in this context is different from its use in functional programming or in mathematics, where pairing \"functional\" with \"flow\" would be ambiguous. Here, \"functional flow\" pertains to the sequencing of operations, with \"flow\" arrows expressing dependence on the success of prior operations. FFBDs may also express input and output data dependencies between functional blocks, as shown in figures below, but FFBDs primarily focus on sequencing.\n\nThe FFBD notation was developed in the 1950s, and is widely used in classical systems engineering. FFBDs are one of the classic business process modeling methodologies, along with flow charts, data flow diagrams, control flow diagrams, Gantt charts, PERT diagrams, and IDEF.\n\nFFBDs are also referred to as \"Functional Flow Diagrams\", \"functional block diagrams\", and \"functional flows\".\n\nThe first structured method for documenting process flow, the flow process chart, was introduced by Frank Gilbreth to members of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”. Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into industrial engineering curricula.\n\nIn the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began training business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid, New York. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program. Another 1944 graduate, Ben S. Graham, Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial, adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set as the ASME Standard for Operation and Flow Process Charts, derived from Gilbreth's original work.\n\nThe modern Functional Flow Block Diagram was developed by TRW Incorporated, a defense-related business, in the 1950s. In the 1960s it was exploited by NASA to visualize the time sequence of events in space systems and flight missions. FFBDs became widely used in classical systems engineering to show the order of execution of system functions.\n\nFFBDs can be developed in a series of levels. FFBDs show the same tasks identified through functional decomposition and display them in their logical, sequential relationship. For example, the entire flight mission of a spacecraft can be defined in a top level FFBD, as shown in Figure 2. Each block in the first level diagram can then be expanded to a series of functions, as shown in the second level diagram for \"perform mission operations.\" Note that the diagram shows both input (transfer to operational orbit) and output (transfer to space transportation system orbit), thus initiating the interface identification and control process. Each block in the second level diagram can be progressively developed into a series of functions, as shown in the third level diagram on Figure 2.\n\nThese diagrams are used both to develop requirements and to identify profitable trade studies. For example, does the spacecraft antenna acquire the tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) only when the payload data are to be transmitted, or does it track TDRS continually to allow for the reception of emergency commands or transmission of emergency data? The FFBD also incorporates alternate and contingency operations, which improve the probability of mission success. The flow diagram provides an understanding of total operation of the system, serves as a basis for development of operational and contingency procedures, and pinpoints areas where changes in operational procedures could simplify the overall system operation. In certain cases, alternate FFBDs may be used to represent various means of satisfying a particular function until data are acquired, which permits selection among the alternatives.\n\nAn overview of the key FFBD attributes: \n\nA function shall be represented by a rectangle containing the title of the function (an action verb followed by a noun phrase) and its unique decimal delimited number. A horizontal line shall separate this number and the title, as shown in see Figure 3 above.

See Figure 9 for an example regarding use of a reference function.\n\nA line with a single arrowhead shall depict functional flow from left to right, see Figure 4.\n\nThe following basic logic symbols shall be used.\n\n\n\nEach FFBD shall contain the following contextual and administrative data:\nFigure 8 and Figure 9 present the data in an FFBD.

This zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is spherically symmetric (hence the name \"asphericity\") but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the three coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a cube, tetrahedron or other Platonic solid.\n\nSimilarly, the acylindricity formula_19 is defined by\n\nwhich is always non-negative and zero only when the two principal moments are equal, λ = λ.\nThis zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is cylindrically symmetric (hence the name, \"acylindricity\"), but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the two coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a regular prism.\n\nFinally, the relative shape anisotropy formula_21 is defined\n\nwhich is bounded between zero and one. formula_21 = 0 only occurs if all points are spherically symmetric, and formula_21 = 1 only occurs if all points lie on a line.\n\n"}

{"id": "42515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42515", "title": "Infinite monkey theorem", "text": "Infinite monkey theorem\n\nThe infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is \"extremely\" low (but technically not zero).\n\nIn this context, \"almost surely\" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the \"monkey\" is not an actual monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the \"monkey metaphor\" is that of French mathematician Émile Borel in 1913, but the first instance may have been even earlier.\n\nVariants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. Jorge Luis Borges traced the history of this idea from Aristotle's \"On Generation and Corruption\" and Cicero's \"De natura deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.\n\nThere is a straightforward proof of this theorem. As an introduction, recall that if two events are statistically independent, then the probability of both happening equals the product of the probabilities of each one happening independently. For example, if the chance of rain in Moscow on a particular day in the future is 0.4 and the chance of an earthquake in San Francisco on any particular day is 0.00003, then the chance of both happening on the same day is , assuming that they are indeed independent.\n\nSuppose the typewriter has 50 keys, and the word to be typed is \"banana\". If the keys are pressed randomly and independently, it means that each key has an equal chance of being pressed. Then, the chance that the first letter typed is 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is \"a\" is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the chance of the first six letters spelling \"banana\" is\nless than one in 15 billion, but not zero, hence a possible outcome.\n\nFrom the above, the chance of \"not\" typing \"banana\" in a given block of 6 letters is 1 − (1/50). Because each block is typed independently, the chance \"X\" of not typing \"banana\" in any of the first \"n\" blocks of 6 letters is\n\nAs \"n\" grows, \"X\" gets smaller. For an \"n\" of a million, \"X\" is roughly 0.9999, but for an \"n\" of 10 billion \"X\" is roughly 0.53 and for an \"n\" of 100 billion it is roughly 0.0017. As \"n\" approaches infinity, the probability \"X\" approaches zero; that is, by making \"n\" large enough, \"X\" can be made as small as is desired, and the chance of typing \"banana\" approaches 100%.\n\nThe same argument shows why at least one of infinitely many monkeys will produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original. In this case \"X\" = (1 − (1/50)) where \"X\" represents the probability that none of the first \"n\" monkeys types \"banana\" correctly on their first try. When we consider 100 billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys \"n\" increases, the value of \"X\" – the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text – approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for \"n\" going to infinity, is zero. So the probability of the word \"banana\" appearing at some point in an infinite sequence of keystrokes is equal to one.\n\nThis can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of strings, which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:\n\nBoth follow easily from the second Borel–Cantelli lemma. For the second theorem, let \"E\" be the event that the \"k\"th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability \"p\" of occurring, the \"E\" are independent, and the below sum diverges,\nthe probability that infinitely many of the \"E\" occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text, and make \"E\" the event where the \"k\"th block equals the desired string.\n\nHowever, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time the results are reversed. If there were as many monkeys as there are atoms in the observable universe typing extremely fast for trillions of times the life of the universe, the probability of the monkeys replicating even a \"single page\" of Shakespeare is unfathomably small.\n\nIgnoring punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of \"Hamlet.\" It has a chance of one in 676 (26 × 26) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks exponentially, at 20 letters it already has only a chance of one in 26 = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376 (almost 2 × 10). In the case of the entire text of \"Hamlet\", the probabilities are so vanishingly small as to be inconceivable. The text of Hamlet contains approximately 130,000 letters. Thus there is a probability of one in 3.4 × 10 to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4 × 10, or including punctuation, 4.4 × 10.\n\nEven if every proton in the observable universe were a monkey with a typewriter, typing from the Big Bang until the end of the universe (when protons might no longer exist), they would still need a still far greater amount of time – more than three hundred and sixty thousand \"orders of magnitude\" longer – to have even a 1 in 10 chance of success. To put it another way, for a one in a trillion chance of success, there would need to be 10 universes made of atomic monkeys. As Kittel and Kroemer put it in their textbook on thermodynamics, the field whose statistical foundations motivated the first known expositions of typing monkeys, \"The probability of \"Hamlet\" is therefore zero in any operational sense of an event...\", and the statement that the monkeys must eventually succeed \"gives a misleading conclusion about very, very large numbers.\"\n\nIn fact there is less than a one in a trillion chance of success that such a universe made of monkeys could type any particular document a mere 79 characters long.\n\nThe probability that an infinite randomly generated string of text will contain a particular finite substring is 1. However, this does not mean the substring's absence is \"impossible\", despite the absence having a prior probability of 0. For example, the immortal monkey \"could\" randomly type G as its first letter, G as its second, and G as every single letter thereafter, producing an infinite string of Gs; at no point must the monkey be \"compelled\" to type anything else. (To assume otherwise implies the gambler's fallacy.) However long a randomly generated finite string is, there is a small but nonzero chance that it will turn out to consist of the same character repeated throughout; this chance approaches zero as the string's length approaches infinity. There is nothing special about such a monotonous sequence except that it is easy to describe; the same fact applies to any nameable specific sequence, such as \"RGRGRG\" repeated forever, or \"a-b-aa-bb-aaa-bbb-...\", or \"Three, Six, Nine, Twelve…\".\n\nIf the hypothetical monkey has a typewriter with 90 equally likely keys that include numerals and punctuation, then the first typed keys might be \"3.14\" (the first three digits of pi) with a probability of (1/90), which is 1/65,610,000. Equally probable is any other string of four characters allowed by the typewriter, such as \"GGGG\", \"mATh\", or \"q%8e\". The probability that 100 randomly typed keys will consist of the first 99 digits of pi (including the separator key), or any other \"particular\" sequence of that length, is much lower: (1/90). If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digits of pi is 0, which is just as \"possible\" (mathematically probable) as typing nothing but Gs (also probability 0).\n\nThe same applies to the event of typing a particular version of \"Hamlet\" followed by endless copies of itself; or \"Hamlet\" immediately followed by all the digits of pi; these specific strings are equally infinite in length, they are not prohibited by the terms of the thought problem, and they each have a prior probability of 0. In fact, \"any\" particular infinite sequence the immortal monkey types will have \"had\" a prior probability of 0, even though the monkey must type something.\n\nThis is an extension of the principle that a finite string of random text has a lower and lower probability of \"being\" a particular string the longer it is (though all specific strings are equally unlikely). This probability approaches 0 as the string approaches infinity. Thus, the probability of the monkey typing an endlessly long string, such as all of the digits of pi in order, on a 90-key keyboard is (1/90) which equals (1/∞) which is essentially 0. At the same time, the probability that the sequence \"contains\" a particular subsequence (such as the word MONKEY, or the 12th through 999th digits of pi, or a version of the King James Bible) increases as the total string increases. This probability approaches 1 as the total string approaches infinity, and thus the original theorem is correct.\n\nIn a simplification of the thought experiment, the monkey could have a typewriter with just two keys: 1 and 0. The infinitely long string thusly produced would correspond to the binary digits of a particular real number between 0 and 1. A countably infinite set of possible strings end in infinite repetitions, which means the corresponding real number is rational. Examples include the strings corresponding to one-third (010101…), five-sixths (11010101…) and five-eighths (1010000…). Only a subset of such real number strings (albeit a countably infinite subset) contains the entirety of \"Hamlet\" (assuming that the text is subjected to a numerical encoding, such as ASCII).\n\nMeanwhile, there is an \"uncountably\" infinite set of strings which do not end in such repetition; these correspond to the irrational numbers. These can be sorted into two uncountably infinite subsets: those which contain \"Hamlet\" and those which do not. However, the \"largest\" subset of all the real numbers are those which not only contain \"Hamlet\", but which contain every other possible string of any length, and with equal distribution of such strings. These irrational numbers are called normal. Because almost all numbers are normal, almost all possible strings contain all possible finite substrings. Hence, the probability of the monkey typing a normal number is 1. The same principles apply regardless of the number of keys from which the monkey can choose; a 90-key keyboard can be seen as a generator of numbers written in base 90.\n\nIn one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its \"dactylographic\" [i.e., typewriting] monkeys (; the French word \"singe\" covers both the monkeys and the apes), appeared in Émile Borel's 1913 article \"Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité\" (\"Statistical mechanics and irreversibility\"), and in his book \"Le Hasard\" in 1914. His \"monkeys\" are not actual monkeys; rather, they are a metaphor for an imaginary way to produce a large, random sequence of letters. Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly.\n\nThe physicist Arthur Eddington drew on Borel's image further in \"The Nature of the Physical World\" (1928), writing:\n\nThese images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen. It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term \"improbable\" is functionally equivalent to \"impossible\".\n\nIn a 1939 essay entitled \"The Total Library\", Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges traced the infinite-monkey concept back to Aristotle's \"Metaphysics.\" Explaining the views of Leucippus, who held that the world arose through the random combination of atoms, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In \"On Generation and Corruption\", the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same \"atoms\", \"i.e.\", alphabetic characters. Three centuries later, Cicero's \"De natura deorum\" (\"On the Nature of the Gods\") argued against the atomist worldview:\n\nBorges follows the history of this argument through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was \"that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.\" (To which Borges adds, \"Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.\") Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:\n\nBorges' total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story \"The Library of Babel\", which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.\n\nIn 2003, lecturers and students from the University of Plymouth MediaLab Arts course used a £2,000 grant from the Arts Council to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six Celebes crested macaques in Paignton Zoo in Devon in England for a month, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website.\n\nNot only did the monkeys produce nothing but five total pages largely consisting of the letter S, the lead male began bashing the keyboard with a stone, and the monkeys followed by soiling it. Mike Phillips, director of the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technology (i-DAT), said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned \"an awful lot\" from it. He concluded that monkeys \"are not random generators. They're more complex than that. ... They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there.\"\n\nIn his 1931 book \"The Mysterious Universe\", Eddington's rival James Jeans attributed the monkey parable to a \"Huxley\", presumably meaning Thomas Henry Huxley. This attribution is incorrect. Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a now-legendary debate over Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, held at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford on 30 June 1860. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter itself had yet to emerge.\n\nDespite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. For example, Doug Powell argues as a Christian apologist that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of \"Hamlet\", it has failed to produce \"Hamlet\" because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in DNA. A more common argument is represented by Reverend John F. MacArthur, who claims that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins employs the typing monkey concept in his book \"The Blind Watchmaker\" to demonstrate the ability of natural selection to produce biological complexity out of random mutations. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his weasel program produce the Hamlet phrase \"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\", starting from a randomly typed parent, by \"breeding\" subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent, with random mutations. The chance of the target phrase appearing in a single step is extremely small, yet Dawkins showed that it could be produced rapidly (in about 40 generations) using cumulative selection of phrases. The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information. As Dawkins acknowledges, however, the weasel program is an imperfect analogy for evolution, as \"offspring\" phrases were selected \"according to the criterion of resemblance to a \"distant ideal\" target.\" In contrast, Dawkins affirms, evolution has no long-term plans and does not progress toward some distant goal (such as humans). The weasel program is instead meant to illustrate the difference between non-random cumulative selection, and random single-step selection. In terms of the typing monkey analogy, this means that \"Romeo and Juliet\" could be produced relatively quickly if placed under the constraints of a nonrandom, Darwinian-type selection because the fitness function will tend to preserve in place any letters that happen to match the target text, improving each successive generation of typing monkeys.\n\nA different avenue for exploring the analogy between evolution and an unconstrained monkey lies in the problem that the monkey types only one letter at a time, independently of the other letters. Hugh Petrie argues that a more sophisticated setup is required, in his case not for biological evolution but the evolution of ideas:\n\nJames W. Valentine, while admitting that the classic monkey's task is impossible, finds that there is a worthwhile analogy between written English and the metazoan genome in this other sense: both have \"combinatorial, hierarchical structures\" that greatly constrain the immense number of combinations at the alphabet level.\n\nR. G. Collingwood argued in 1938 that art cannot be produced by accident, and wrote as a sarcastic aside to his critics,\n\nNelson Goodman took the contrary position, illustrating his point along with Catherine Elgin by the example of Borges' \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\",\n\nIn another writing, Goodman elaborates, \"That the monkey may be supposed to have produced his copy randomly makes no difference. It is the same text, and it is open to all the same interpretations...\" Gérard Genette dismisses Goodman's argument as begging the question.\n\nFor Jorge J. E. Gracia, the question of the identity of texts leads to a different question, that of author. If a monkey is capable of typing \"Hamlet\", despite having no intention of meaning and therefore disqualifying itself as an author, then it appears that texts do not require authors. Possible solutions include saying that whoever finds the text and identifies it as \"Hamlet\" is the author; or that Shakespeare is the author, the monkey his agent, and the finder merely a user of the text. These solutions have their own difficulties, in that the text appears to have a meaning separate from the other agents: what if the monkey operates before Shakespeare is born, or if Shakespeare is never born, or if no one ever finds the monkey's typescript?\n\nThe theorem concerns a thought experiment which cannot be fully carried out in practice, since it is predicted to require prohibitive amounts of time and resources. Nonetheless, it has inspired efforts in finite random text generation.\n\nOne computer program run by Dan Oliver of Scottsdale, Arizona, according to an article in \"The New Yorker\", came up with a result on August 4, 2004: After the group had worked for 42,162,500,000 billion billion monkey-years, one of the \"monkeys\" typed, \"VALENTINE. Cease toIdor:eFLP0FRjWK78aXzVOwm)-‘;8.t\" The first 19 letters of this sequence can be found in \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\". Other teams have reproduced 18 characters from \"Timon of Athens\", 17 from \"Troilus and Cressida\", and 16 from \"Richard II\".\n\nA website entitled \"The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator\", launched on July 1, 2003, contained a Java applet that simulated a large population of monkeys typing randomly, with the stated intention of seeing how long it takes the virtual monkeys to produce a complete Shakespearean play from beginning to end. For example, it produced this partial line from \"Henry IV, Part 2\", reporting that it took \"2,737,850 million billion billion billion monkey-years\" to reach 24 matching characters:\n\nDue to processing power limitations, the program used a probabilistic model (by using a random number generator or RNG) instead of actually generating random text and comparing it to Shakespeare. When the simulator \"detected a match\" (that is, the RNG generated a certain value or a value within a certain range), the simulator simulated the match by generating matched text.\n\nMore sophisticated methods are used in practice for natural language generation. If instead of simply generating random characters one restricts the generator to a meaningful vocabulary and conservatively following grammar rules, like using a context-free grammar, then a random document generated this way can even fool some humans (at least on a cursory reading) as shown in the experiments with SCIgen, snarXiv, and the Postmodernism Generator.\n\nQuestions about the statistics describing how often an ideal monkey is expected to type certain strings translate into practical tests for random-number generators; these range from the simple to the \"quite sophisticated\". Computer-science professors George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman report that they used to call one such category of tests \"overlapping m-tuple tests\" in lectures, since they concern overlapping m-tuples of successive elements in a random sequence. But they found that calling them \"monkey tests\" helped to motivate the idea with students. They published a report on the class of tests and their results for various RNGs in 1993.\n\nThe infinite monkey theorem and its associated imagery is considered a popular and proverbial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known to the general public because of its transmission through popular culture rather than through formal education. This is helped by the innate humor stemming from the image of literal monkeys rattling away on a set of typewriters, and is a popular visual gag.\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Last Exit to Springfield\", Mr. Burns shows Homer \"a room with a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters. Soon they will have written the greatest novel known to man!\" Burns then chastises one monkey for typing, \"It was the best of times, it was the \"blurst\" of times!\".\n\nIn his 1978 radio play, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", Douglas Adams invoked the theorem to illustrate the power of the 'Infinite Improbability Drive' that powered a spaceship. From Episode 2: \"Ford, there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out.\"\n\nA quotation attributed to a 1996 speech by Robert Wilensky stated, \"We've heard that a million monkeys at a million keyboards could produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true.\"\n\nThe enduring, widespread popularity of the theorem was noted in the introduction to a 2001 paper, \"Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks: The Internet in the Light of the Theory of Accidental Excellence\". In 2002, an article in \"The Washington Post\" said, \"Plenty of people have had fun with the famous notion that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time could eventually write the works of Shakespeare\". In 2003, the previously mentioned Arts Council funded experiment involving real monkeys and a computer keyboard received widespread press coverage. In 2007, the theorem was listed by \"Wired\" magazine in a list of eight classic thought experiments.\n\n\n"}

For a cascade to begin an individual must encounter a scenario with a decision, typically a binary one. Second, outside factors can influence this decision (typically, through the observation of actions and their outcomes of other individuals in similar scenarios). Due to this influence, researchers have drawn comparisons between information cascades and herd behavior.\n\nThe two-step process of an informational cascade can be broken down into five basic components:\n\n1. There is a decision to be made – for example; whether to adopt a new technology, wear a new style of clothing, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular political position\n\n2. A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)\n\n3. People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier\n\n4. Each person has some information aside from their own that helps guide their decision\n\n5. A person can't directly observe the outside information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this information from what they do\n\nSocial perspectives of cascades, which suggest that agents may act irrationally (e.g., against what they think is optimal) when social pressures are great, exist as complements to the concept of information cascades. More often the problem is that the concept of an information cascade is confused with ideas that do not match the two key conditions of the process, such as social proof, information diffusion, and social influence. Indeed, the term information cascade has even been used to refer to such processes.\n\nInformation cascades occur when external information obtained from previous participants in an event overrides one's own private signal, irrespective of the correctness of the former over the latter. The experiment conducted in is a useful example of this process. The experiment consisted of two urns labeled A and B. Urn A contains two balls labeled \"a\" and one labeled \"b\". Urn B contains one ball labeled \"a\" and two labeled \"b\". The urn from which a ball must be drawn during each run is determined randomly and with equal probabilities (from the throw of a die). The contents of the chosen urn are emptied into a neutral container. The participants are then asked in random order to draw a marble from this container. This entire process may be termed a \"run\", and a number of such runs are performed.\n\nEach time a participant picks up a marble, he is to decide which urn it belongs to. His decision is then announced for the benefit of the remaining participants in the room. Thus, the (n+1)th participant has information about the decisions made by all the n participants preceding him, and also his private signal which is the label on the ball that he draws during his turn. The experimenters observed that an information cascade was observed in 41 of 56 such runs. This means, in the runs where the cascade occurred, at least one participant gave precedence to earlier decisions over his own private signal. It is possible for such an occurrence to produce the wrong result. This phenomenon is known as \"Reverse Cascade\".\n\nA person's signal telling them to accept is denoted as (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is (a low signal). The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an , and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an signal. This is essentially a conditional probability – the probability of when the correct action is to accept, or formula_1. Similarly formula_2 is the probability that an agent gets an signal when the correct action is reject. If these likelihoods are represented by \"q\", then \"q\" > 0.5. This is summarized in the table below.\nThe first agent determines whether or not to accept solely based on his own signal. As the model assumes that all agents act rationally, the action (accept or reject) the agent feels is more likely is the action he will choose to take. This decision can be explained using Bayes rule:\n\nformula_3\n\nIf the agent receives an signal, then the likelihood of accepting is obtained by calculating formula_4. The equation says that, by virtue of the fact that \"q\" > 0.5, the first agent, acting only on his private signal, will always increase his estimate of \"p\" with an signal. Similarly, it can be shown that an agent will always decrease his expectation of \"p\" when he receives a low signal. Recalling that, if the value, , of accepting is equal to the value of rejecting, then an agent will accept if he believes \"p\" > 0.5, and reject otherwise. Because this agent started out with the assumption that both accepting and rejecting are equally viable options (\"p\" = 0.5), the observation of an signal will allow him to conclude that accepting is the rational choice.\n\nThe second agent then considers both the first agent's decision and his own signal, again in a rational fashion. In general, the \"n\"th agent considers the decisions of the previous \"n\"-1 agents, and his own signal. He makes a decision based on Bayesian reasoning to determine the most rational choice.\nformula_5\nWhere is the number of accepts in the previous set plus the agent's own signal, and is the number of rejects. Thus, . The decision is based on how the value on the right hand side of the equation compares with \"p\".\n\nThe original model makes several assumptions about human behavior and the world in which humans act, some of which are relaxed in later versions or in alternate definitions of similar problems, such as the diffusion of innovations. \n\n\nA literature exists that examines how individuals or firms might respond to the existence of informational cascades when they have products to sell but where buyers are unsure of the quality of those products. Curtis Taylor (1999) shows that when selling a house the seller might wish to start with high prices, as failure to sell with low prices is indicative of low quality and might start a cascade on not buying, while failure to sell with high prices could be construed as meaning the house is just over-priced, and prices can then be reduced to get a sale. Daniel Sgroi (2002) shows that firms might use \"guinea pigs\" who are given the opportunity to buy early to kick-start an informational cascade through their early and public purchasing decisions, and work by David Gill and Daniel Sgroi (2008) show that early public tests might have a similar effect (and in particular that passing a \"tough test\" which is biased against the seller can instigate a cascade all by itself). Bose \"et al.\" have examined how prices set by a monopolist might evolve in the presence of potential cascade behavior where the monopolist and consumers are unsure of a products quality.\n\nInformation cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs one's own judgment. That is, one thinks: \"It's more likely that I'm wrong than that all those other people are wrong. Therefore, I will do as they do.\"\n\nIn what has been termed a reputational cascade, late responders sometimes go along with the decisions of early responders, not just because the late responders think the early responders are right, but also because they perceive their reputation will be damaged if they dissent from the early responders.\n\nInformation cascades have become one of the topics of behavioral economics, as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive price moves, either for the whole market (market bubble...) or a specific asset, like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.\n\nMarketers also use the idea of cascades to attempt to get a buying cascade started for a new product. If they can induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the product even if it is no better than, or perhaps even worse than, competing products. This is most effective if these later consumers are able to observe the adoption decisions, but not how satisfied the early customers actually were with the choice. This is consistent with the idea that cascades arise naturally when people can see what others do but not what they know.\n\nInformation cascades are usually considered by economists:\n\nDotey et al. state that information flows in the form of cascades on the social network. According to the authors, analysis of virality of information cascades on a social network may lead to many useful applications like determining the most influential individuals within a network. This information can be used for \"maximizing market effectiveness\" or \"influencing public opinion\". Various structural and temporal features of a network affect cascade virality.\n\nIn contrast to work on information cascades in social networks, the Social Influence Model of belief spread argues that people have some notion of the private beliefs of those in their network. The social influence model, then, relaxes the assumption of information cascades that people are acting only on observable actions taken by others. In addition, the social influence model focuses on embedding people within a social network, as opposed to a queue. Finally, the social influence model relaxes the assumption of the information cascade model that people will either complete an action or not by allowing for a continuous scale of the \"strength\" of an agents belief that an action should be completed.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the examples above, Information Cascades have been shown to exist in several empirical studies. Perhaps the best example, given above, is. Participants stood in a line behind an urn which had balls of different colors. Sequentially, participants would pick a ball out of the urn, looks at it, and then places it back into the urn. The agent then voices their opinion of which color of balls (red or blue) there is a majority of in the urn for the rest of the participants to hear. Participants get a monetary reward if they guess correctly, forcing the concept of rationality.\n\nOther examples include\n\nThe negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. Ward Farnsworth, a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book \"The Legal Analyst\": in many military courts, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as Israel and France have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before elections to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.\n\nAs previously stated, informational cascades are logical processes describing how an individual’s decision process changes based upon outside information. Cascades have never been a household name; at best, they exist hypothetically. Over the past few decades, cascades saw an increase in popularity through various fields of study. Specifically, they have been quite useful in comparing thought processes between Greek and German organic farmers. The aforementioned study suggests discrepancies between Greek and German thought processes based upon their cultural and socioeconomic differences. Even further, cascades have been extrapolated to ideas such as financial volatility and monetary policy. In 2004 Helmut Wagner and Wolfram Berger suggested cascades as an analytical vehicle to examine changes to the financial market as it became more globalized. Wagner and Berger noticed structural changes to the framework of understanding financial markets due to globalization; giving rise to volatility in capital flow and spawning uncertainty which affected central banks. Additionally, information cascades are useful in understanding the origins of terrorist tactics. When the attack by Black September occurred in 1972 it was hard not to see the similarities between their tactics and the Baader-Meinhof group (also known as the Red Army Faction [RAF]). All of these examples portray how the process of cascades were put into use. Moreover, it is important to understand the framework of cascades to move forward in a more globalized society. Establishing a foundation to understanding the passage of information through transnational and multinational organizations, and even more, is critical to the arising modern society. Summing up all of these points, cascades, as a general term, encompass a spectrum of different concepts. Information cascades have been the underlying thread in how information is transferred, overwritten, and understood through various cultures spanning from a multitude of different countries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1199133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1199133", "title": "Kermit Washington", "text": "Kermit Washington\n\nKermit Alan Washington (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional basketball player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player Rudy Tomjanovich during an on-court fight in 1977. His punch nearly killed Tomjanovich, and resulted in severe medical problems that ultimately ended Tomjanovich's playing career. \n\nWashington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school and barely got into college on an athletic scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once at American University, and became one of only seven players in NCAA history to average 20 points and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.\n\nA big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather rebounds. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons and played in the All-Star Game once. Washington was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the fifth overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach Pete Newell before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, Boston Celtics, San Diego Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors.\n\nKermit Washington's mother Barbara graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into Howard University), where she was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an X-ray technician. Washington had a rough childhood. When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked his uncle with an iron. His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared. Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who came and took them back. His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.\n\nThe effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying \"I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family.\" However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.\n\nAs a senior in high school, Washington stood but weighed a mere 150 lbs. After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class. He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects. When Thomas became his home room teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses. Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.\n\nHis basketball performance in high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house. Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.\n\nDuring the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as \"the happiest time in my life.\" He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.\n\nHe averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball. He still played a somewhat unaggressive or \"soft\" brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team. Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the University of Nebraska who was studying as an undergrad at American. Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be \"cool\" on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks. Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an NCAA-leading 19.8 rebounds in his junior season. He was drafted after his junior season by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him. He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school. He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 Olympic basketball team after the season, but did not make the squad.\n\nWashington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season. He marveled at newspaper reports in the \"Washington Post\" that mentioned \"coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop \"Kermit Washington\".\" He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season. He was a second team All-American, and helped American into the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep. The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark. He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game. He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology. Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.\n\nWashington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony. He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed in high school and college due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA. He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be \"labeled soft.\" The injury would bother him the rest of his career. He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.\nEntering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: \"Listen, you better learn how to play this game.\" The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.\n\nNewell had Washington watch tapes of Paul Silas, who was a rebounding forward for the Boston Celtics, and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game. He reworked Washington's game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly \"Big Man Camp\" in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.\n\nLos Angeles had acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. \"I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg.\" Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.\n\nNewell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of \"Sports Illustrated\" (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, \"Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates.\"\n\nOn December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the Houston Rockets, a scuffle broke out between several players at midcourt.\n\nThe events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted. Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks center Kent Benson elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand. Washington got into a brawl with several Buffalo Braves players a few games later. In the December game, at the beginning of the game's second half, Lakers guard Norm Nixon missed a shot. Houston's Kevin Kunnert and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate John Lucas. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward Robert Reid insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a \"scuffle\" between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch. Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle. But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.\n\nWashington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8 mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was \"the loudest silence you have ever heard.\" Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.\n\nTomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said \"I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it,\" and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.\n\nWorsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked, and \"Saturday Night Live\", then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member Garrett Morris comically defend the punch. It was also the subject of a \"New York Times\" editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed the rest of the season and they felt Washington should at least have done likewise.\n\nOn-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that \"you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other.\" Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.\n\nWashington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son at the time of the punch. His wife recalls she and her children were treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell's home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.\nOn December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington's. His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.\n\nYears later, Jerry West, who was the Lakers coach at the time, told John Feinstein he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager Bill Sharman said he was \"on the fence.\" Cooke, however, decided to move on.\n\nWashington started alongside Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, \"It's great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he's rebounding.\" Auerbach said, \"Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted.\" Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.\n\nKunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.\n\nWashington and Kunnert became involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in California but also wanted continue to own an NBA team. To solve this problem, he and John Y. Brown, Jr., owner of the Buffalo Braves NBA team, exchanged franchises. Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal. Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the San Diego Clippers.\n\nIn November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two. Before the game, the Clippers coach, Gene Shue, had suggested to the Rockets coach, Tom Nissalke, that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.\n\nAfter a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and Randy Smith to Portland in exchange for Walton. This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade. \n\nPortland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager Stu Inman, was a close friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.\n\nDuring the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets' civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.\n\nWashington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the full-time starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.\n\nSince retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of charitable organizations. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area with former Blazer teammate Kevin Duckworth, called \"Le Slam.\" The restaurant closed in 2001. He has also served in a coaching role with Stanford University, and worked at Pete Newell's fabled \"Big Man Camp\" for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa. In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to Goma, Zaire, working in a refugee camp helping victims of the bloody Rwandan Civil War. The stench of death and human waste extended for miles. \"It was a sad, sad sight\", Washington later recalled, \"a sight I'll never forget.\"\n\nAfter his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told \"The New York Times\" that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nWashington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, this appears to be a misrepresentation of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: \"I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant.\" John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:\nWashington currently lives in the Washington, D.C. area, where he is employed as a regional representative of the National Basketball Players Association.\n\nOn May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for allegedly embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa. On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to launder money he received as kickbacks. Washington, as a regional representative for the National Basketball Players Association, referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending. Washington failed to report this money as income on his tax return. In July 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for charity fraud.\n\n\n\n"}

Its discovery in 1963 was first described by J. K. Woo the following year. The cranial capacity is estimated to be , somewhat similar to that of its contemporary, Java Man.\n\nRemnants of Lantian Man were found in Lantian County, in China's Shaanxi province, approximately 50 km southeast of Xi'an. Shortly after the discovery of the mandible (jaw bone) of the first Lantian Man at Chenjiawo (陈家窝), also in Lantian, a cranium (skull) with nasal bones, right maxilla, and three teeth of another specimen of Lantian Man were found at Gongwangling (公王岭), another site in Lantian. \n\nA skull found at Gongwangling is the oldest fossil of a \"Homo erectus\" ever found in northern Asia. When first published in 1964, it was dated to 1.15 million years ago, but in 2001, Zhu Zhaoyu (), a geologist at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other scientists began a fresh research of the site. Their new analysis was published in 2015, which has determined that the strata containing the cranium from Gongwangling dates to approximately 1.63 million years ago, much older than the previous estimate of 1.15 million years. This new confirmed date makes the cranium the second oldest site outside of Africa, Dmanisi, Georgia being the oldest. It is older than the Peking Man, but slightly younger than the Yuanmou Man. Zhu's further survey of the region led to the discovery of the Shangchen site in Lantian, which was published in 2018. Stone tools (but no hominin fossils) found at Shangchen are dated to more than 2.1 million years ago, the earliest known evidence of hominins outside Africa, surpassing Dmanisi by 300,000 years.\n\nUntil the 1980s it had been commonly accepted that comparisons between European and Asian Paleolithic cultures were not possible. The common thinking was that there was too great a difference between their tool technologies. In the 1940s a researcher, H.L. Movius, proposed that the Paleolithic West was made up of \"hand axe cultures\", while the East had \"chopper-chopping tool cultures\". Numerous research into technological traditions followed the model proposed by Movius in support of the East/West technology divide.\n\nTwenty-six lithic artifacts were uncovered in the same loess sedimentary deposit as the cranium from the Gongwangling site in Lantian County, China. The artifacts consisted of cores, flakes, choppers, hand-axes, spheroids, and scrapers. Lab analysis suggested that the \"early hominins chose quartzite, quartz, greywacke and igneous rock pebbles/cobbles on the riverbank for stone knapping, whereas the fine sandstone, siliceous limestone and chert were used only occasionally.\" Studying the assemblage from Gongwangling along with a series of other sites in the Lantian region leads researchers to believe that the tools utilized by the hominids are more similar to the Acheulean tools utilized in the West than previously thought. This means that the tool technology is not different, and still consists of more large hand tools e.g. hand-axes than previous researchers thought and represents a continuum of technology from the West rather than two separately occurring technologies.\n\n\n\n"}

She has been described as alt-right, though she has denied this. In 2015, Southern ran as a Libertarian Party candidate in the Canadian federal election. She worked for The Rebel Media until March 2017. In addition, she has written for \"Spiked\", the \"International Business Times\", and The Libertarian Republic. Southern continues to work independently and uploads videos on YouTube.\n\nIn 2017, Southern supported the white identitarian group Defend Europe opposing the action of non-governmental organizations involved in search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea. She was detained by the Italian Coast Guard for blocking a ship embarking on a search-and-rescue mission. In March 2018, she was questioned under the UK Terrorism Act and denied entry to Britain, because of her intentions during her March visit. She said she was \"permanently banned\" from the UK, though it was later confirmed she was refused entry for specific purposes only, not banned.\n\nIn July 2018, she went on a speaking tour of Australia and jokingly called for the country to be bombed, quoting the Bible. In August 2018, her attempted speaking tour of New Zealand was unsuccessful. Auckland Council cancelled Southern's booking and blocked her from using its venues to \"stir up ethnic or religious tensions\".\n\nSouthern was born in Surrey, British Columbia. She studied political science at the University of the Fraser Valley but completed only two years and did not receive a degree. Regarding her reason for dropping out, Southern stated that it was a waste of money to pay for knowledge that she could get on her own.\n\nIn 2015, Southern was a candidate in the 2015 Canadian federal election representing the Libertarian Party in the district of Langley—Aldergrove. She was briefly removed by the party as a candidate, but was eventually reinstated with support from Breitbart News and The Rebel Media. The election was eventually won by Conservative candidate Mark Warawa. Southern finished last, having received 535 votes, or 0.9% of the total.\n\nIn June 2015 while reporting on the Vancouver SlutWalk for Rebel Media, Southern's cameraman was shoved and Southern's protest sign stating \"There Is No Rape Culture In The West\" was torn up.\n\nIn March 2016, a protester in Vancouver poured a container of urine over Southern's head while she was engaging with LGBTQ protesters at a rally in Vancouver, arguing for two human genders.\n\nSouthern was mistakenly suspended from Facebook, having criticized the site for banning several conservative commentators. She later received an email apology from Facebook saying the suspension was an \"error\".\n\nIn October 2016, Southern had her gender legally changed to male as part of a video produced for Rebel Media to show the ease of Ontario's new gender ID laws.\n\nIn 2016, Southern authored and self-published \"Barbarians: How Baby Boomers, Immigrants, and Islam Screwed My Generation\".\n\nIn January 2017, Southern posted incorrect rumours from 4chan that the Quebec City mosque shooting had been carried out by Syrian refugees; she later deleted those tweets. In March 2017, Southern announced she would be leaving Rebel Media to become an independent journalist. In the same month, she gained access to White House press briefings.\n\nIn April 2017, Southern was one of several scheduled speakers at a Patriots' Day rally in Berkeley, California. The rally led to a riot between pro-Trump demonstrators and anti-Trump counter-protesters.\n\nIn May 2017, Southern took part in an attempt organized by the identitarian group \"Génération identitare\" to block the passage of an NGO ship, the \"Aquarius\" (co-owned by SOS Mediterranée and by Doctors without Borders), which was leaving Sicily to start a search-and-rescue mission for ship-wrecked migrants off the shores of Northern Africa. Claiming that the goal of the activists \"was to stop an empty boat from going down to Libya and filling up with illegal migrants\", Southern was briefly detained by the Italian Coast Guard. NGO ships often rescue migrants and refugees, who disembark from Libyan shores on unsafe makeshift rafts, and bring them to Sicily. With regard to her actions, Southern stated that \"if the politicians won't stop the boats, we'll stop the boats.\"\n\nSouthern supported similar actions by identitarian group Defend Europe, which chartered a vessel in order to track and stop what it called collusion between NGOs and human traffickers. The group has been accused of intending to obstruct the rescue of migrants and refugees in distress at sea. In July 2017, Southern revealed that Patreon had deleted her account out of concerns about her \"raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life\". Southern denied these allegations, stating that Defend Europe's actions were likely to save lives and that none of her funding went towards the group.\n\nIn February 2018, Southern, along with Brittany Pettibone and Caolan Robertson, distributed flyers in the English town of Luton describing Allah as \"gay\".\n\nIn March 2018, Southern, Pettibone, and Pettibone's boyfriend, Martin Sellner, were all denied entry to the United Kingdom. Southern was also questioned under the Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Her denial of entry was due to her intentions during her March visit and on the same grounds as Pettibone and Sellner.\n\nShe said she was \"permanently banned\" from the UK. However, it was later confirmed she was instead refused entry for specific purposes only, and reports of her being banned were false.\n\nShortly before a planned speaking tour of Australia in July 2018, Australia's Department of Home Affairs denied Lauren Southern an Electronic Travel Authority visa, saying it was \"not a working visa\". She intended to charge $79 for a basic ticket and up to $749 for an \"intimate dinner\". The Australian government allowed her to enter the country once she had the correct visa. Arriving at Brisbane airport, she was wearing an \"It's OK to be white\" shirt.\n\nWhen she asked people on the street in Melbourne \"Should we kill Lauren Southern?\", many had never heard of her. A speaking event in Melbourne was opposed by more than 100 protestors.\n\nThere were no protestors at her event in Sydney, where ticket holders were notified of the venue by receiving a text on the day. The Sydney event included a $200 meet-and-greet, a $500 VIP meet-and-greet and a $750 dinner.\n\nIn Brisbane, Lauren Southern supported bombing the Australian city of Melbourne, quoting the Bible, as a joke. She was opposed by around 60 protesters.\n\nIn August 2018, Southern's attempted speaking tour of New Zealand was unsuccessful. Auckland Council cancelled her booking and blocked her from using its venues to \"stir up ethnic or religious tensions\". For agreeing with the cancellation, an MP received violent threats.\n\nThe subsequent booking of a private venue was revoked by its owners, one of whom said \"The minute I heard who it was I cancelled\". In retaliation, their venue was vandalised.\n\nThe failure to find a venue was celebrated by around 1,000 protestors, who said the planned event had nothing to do with freedom of speech. The Prime Minister said Southern's views \"are not those that are shared by this country\".\n\nSouthern and Canadian podcaster and YouTuber Stefan Molyneux were scheduled to speak in Auckland on 3 August 2018, at an Auckland Council-owned theatre. However, Auckland Live, the Council agency responsible for the theatre, cancelled the venue booking on the grounds of concerns around \"the health and safety of the presenters, staff and patrons\". The Mayor of Auckland Phil Goff then tweeted that Council venues should not be used to \"stir up ethnic or religious tensions\". He later said \"we've got no obligation at all\" to provide a venue for \"hate speech\". In response, Southern denied assertions that her views were \"hate speech\" and warned about the danger of \"progressivism\".\n\nNew Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters and National Party leader Simon Bridges said they would have supported her right to speak, while Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson said she supported the ban. For saying so, Davidson's family was sent degrading messages of a sexual nature and death threats by supporters of Lauren Southern. Human rights lawyer Craig Tuck criticized Mayor Goff's decision as a violation of free speech, while the cancellation of Southern and Molyneux's tour was welcomed by the Auckland Peace Action activist group and the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ). By contrast, \"The Spinoff\" contributor Ali Shakir said that while he disagreed with many of Southern's views, he thought she and Molyneux should be welcomed to New Zealand and said that barring them damaged the country's commitment to freedom of expression and raised \"serious concerns about the process.\" Shakir also questioned FIANZ's claim to speak for all Muslims. A group called the Free Speech Coalition advocated for a judicial review of the cancellation and raised NZ$50,000 in less than 24 hours. The group's supporters included former Labour Party cabinet minister Michael Bassett, former National and ACT parties leader Don Brash, Property Institute chief executive Ashley Church, Auckland University of Technology historian Paul Moon, broadcaster Lindsay Perrigo, political commentator Chris Trotter, and New Zealand Taxpayers' Union director Jordan Williams.\n\nOn 20 July, Immigration New Zealand granted visas for Southern and Molyneux to visit New Zealand. While describing their views as \"repugnant\" and \"counter to the kind and tolerant values of the vast majority of New Zealanders\", Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway cleared their entry on the grounds that the duo had met immigration character requirements including not having prior criminal convictions. He added that they were never banned from Australia or the United Kingdom as previously reported. Southern welcomed the news and tweeted that she hoped that she and Molyneux could be \"unbarred\" from their venue as well.\n\nAlistair McCylmont, a leading immigration lawyer, later said there were \"plenty\" of grounds to stop the two coming into the country. He cited the visa cancellation of a rapper in 2014 using a law usually reserved for white supremacists, and suggested the grounds of a risk to order or the public interest. \"Considering the amount of information out there in the public forum about the views held by the different people and what they've been talking, they would be plenty of grounds that could have been applied to declining visas.\" However, the minister took the view that denying entry would not be justified.\n\nOn 25 July, Southern and Molyneux cancelled their trip to New Zealand. The Free Speech Coalition said time had run out to find alternative arrangements for the pair, following the Auckland Council ban. On 26 July, Southern and Molyneux's promoter David Pellowe said that the duo would be speaking in Auckland after claiming that a new speaking venue had been found.\n\nOn 2 August, Southern and Molyneux arrived in Auckland for their speaking event on the following day. An email to attendees said the pair look forward to the day when \"ideas right of Stalin are permitted equal rights to peaceful assembly\". The speaking tour was booked at Auckland's Powerstation theatre but was cancelled shortly after the venue was revealed on social media. Owner Peter Campbell rescinded the booking, citing disruption to neighbours. Co-owner Gabrielle Mullins cited \"humanitarian issues\", adding \"The minute I heard who it was I cancelled\", \"It goes against quite a lot of things that we say\" and \"They can say whatever they want but personally I don't want it in my venue\". For refusing to host the speakers, their building was vandalised with graffiti.\n\nTāmaki Anti Fascist Action spokesperson Sina Brown-Davis said her group feared \"dehumanising depictions of indigenous people\" in New Zealand. Molyneux had called Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people \"the lowest rung of civilisation\". Brown-Davis added \"They've been quite clever framing this as a free speech issue, which they use as a smokescreen to introduce their politics of hate and division.\" In response to the cancellation, Southern blamed a \"violent and scary minority willing to make threats and commit violence\" for shutting down free speech. Roughly 1000 protestors gathered in Auckland's Aotea Square that night, celebrating the cancellation of the event, which they said had nothing to do with freedom of speech.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand is \"hostile\" to the views of the speakers and \"I think you'll see from the reaction they've had from New Zealanders that their views are not those that are shared by this country, and I'm quite proud of that\". Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson added \"Aotearoa does not stand for your messages of racism, hatred and especially white supremacy\". Justice Minister Andrew Little said the speakers \"clearly have misled people\" in trying to secure the venue. TV personality Te Hamua Nikora said the pair were against multiculturalism, unlike New Zealand. The minimum ticket price for the cancelled Auckland event was $99.\n\nSouthern has been widely described as alt-right, far right and right-wing. She rejects the label \"alt-right\". The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Southern's videos as anti-feminist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and borderline white nationalist. She is anti-multiculturalism and has called the Black Lives Matter movement a \"terrorist organisation\".\n\nSouthern said transgender people have a \"genuine delusion\" adding \"It’s body dysmorphia and that is a mental illness\". She criticised legal recognition for changing one's gender, because people doing so might be \"dishonest\".\n\nSouthern has spoken in opposition to feminism and has said that women are \"not psychologically developed to hold leadership positions\", and \"not going to be as great being CEOs\". In 2015 she attended SlutWalk and held a sign that read, \"There is no rape culture in the West.\" She also said that it was \"insane\" to focus on the issue.\n\nSouthern is against multiculturalism. She has asked whether a multicultural society would require \"witch doctors\" at medical conferences, and has claimed that \"multiculturalism will inevitably fail unless 50 per cent of the population believes in Western culture\". New Matilda reported that the core message of her 2018 speaking tour of Australia was that \"multiculturalism doesn't work\". On the tour, she caused controversy for publicly criticizing an \"Asian only\" room-share advert that she had photographed and published as evidence of the \"extremely tribalistic\" nature of immigrants; attempting to highlight the supposed failure of multiculturalism, in that it produced a form of \"segregation\".\n\nSouthern defended the American alt-right leader Richard Spencer, who said \"Hail Trump\" in a speech at a white nationalist gathering, and called for a \"peaceful\" ethnic cleansing of America. Southern said he \"is not a white supremacist, he is a white nationalist. He believes in a white ethnostate.\"\n\nSouthern has promoted the white genocide conspiracy theory. She has advocated for European countries to refuse refugees from Africa and Asia, saying that immigration would lead to white genocide, and has been labelled in media as a \"booster\" for the conspiracy at large. In 2018, Southern produced a documentary called \"Farmlands\" about the conspiracy theory in relation to post-Apartheid farm violence in South Africa. \"Farmlands\" includes claims of an impending race war in South Africa, a common talking point for white nationalists.\n\n"}

It was made popular by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and contends that the terms of the United States Constitution should be interpreted as meaning what they meant when they were ratified, which is to say, it asks the question: \"What would a reasonable person living at the time of ratification have understood these words to mean?\"\n\nThe theory stands in equal opposition to interpretivist theories such as original intent, and legal realist theories such as that of the living Constitution.\n\nOriginal meaning is a formalist theory, and a logical extension of textualism. Textualists believe that a statute means whatever the plain meaning of its words is, as opposed to other potential meanings, such as what those who drafted the law or voted for it \"intended\" it to say. Formalists would point out that it is unnecessary for any member of the legislature to share the intentions of any other member of the legislature, or even to \"have\" a particular intent; what counts is their vote, just as if a voter enters a polling station while inebriated, and indicates a preference for the wrong candidate, their vote will count as a vote for the person they indicated on the ballot paper, not for the candidate for whom they intended to vote before they started drinking. Likewise, even if not a single member of the legislature has read and comprehended the effect of a given bill (a scenario some critics of the USA PATRIOT Act and Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allege to have actually occurred during the enactment of these statutes), once it becomes law, it is a law no less or more valid than an identically worded law passed when every member of the legislature is of the same mind and understanding regarding its meaning and effect. This being the case, it is the text of the law which governs.\n\nAn originalist inquiry into the original \"meaning\" of the Constitution is able to cast a much broader net than an inquiry into the original \"intent\".\n\nOriginalists of all stripes cite \"The Federalist Papers\". It is fairly tenuous to suggest that this represents a good source for the original \"intent\": after all, Alexander Hamilton, who wrote the majority of those essays, was absent for the greater part of the Philadelphia Convention, and John Jay did not attend it at all. However, James Madison, the principal framer of the Constitution also wrote a substantial amount of \"The Federalist Papers\". Also, to suggest Hamilton and Jay's absence from the convention implies their ignorance as to the Constitution's original meaning is demeaning to those two men and inaccurate. The collected anti-Federalist papers, of course, will be no use at all to a person searching for the original \"intent\" of the framers. However, as evidence of how a reasonable person at the time would have understood the words of the Constitution, \"The Federalist Papers\" and the anti-Federalist essays are evidence of direct relevance.\n\nLikewise, neither John Adams nor Thomas Jefferson attended the Convention, and thus two of the most prolific writers of the founding era are necessarily excluded (or, at best, abstracted) from an original-intent inquiry. Because they were reasonable contemporaries of the Framers, their writings are informative to discussions of the text's original meaning.\n\nOne of the primary virtues of original meaning over original intent is that the original meaning is a fairly discernible thing, while the original intent is nebulous and uncertain. This is well-illustrated by the use of dictionaries. Contemporaneous dictionaries are of dubious value to an original \"intent\" inquiry, but of high value to an original \"meaning\" inquiry: we can establish what the words the Framers chose \"meant\", but that is not \"necessarily\" conclusive as to what they \"intended\" to say (consider for example, the law of unintended consequences).\n\nThe theory was arguably pioneered and popularized by Justice Antonin Scalia; whether Scalia could take credit for inventing it, he remained one of its most forceful and high-profile proponents, although he was also accused of deviating from the method (he himself admitted that \"in a crunch I may prove a faint-hearted originalist\") (Scalia, \"Originalism: The Lesser Evil\", 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849 at 864).\n\n"}

{"id": "681666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=681666", "title": "Penrose diagram", "text": "Penrose diagram\n\nIn theoretical physics, a Penrose diagram (named after mathematical physicist Roger Penrose) is a two-dimensional diagram capturing the causal relations between different points in spacetime. It is an extension of a Minkowski diagram where the vertical dimension represents time, and the horizontal dimension represents space, and slanted lines at an angle of 45° correspond to light rays. The biggest difference is that locally, the metric on a Penrose diagram is conformally equivalent to the actual metric in spacetime. The conformal factor is chosen such that the entire infinite spacetime is transformed into a Penrose diagram of finite size. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, every point in the diagram corresponds to a 2-dimensional sphere.\n\nWhile Penrose diagrams share the same basic coordinate vector system of other space-time diagrams for local asymptotically flat spacetime, it introduces a system of representing distant spacetime by shrinking or \"crunching\" distances that are further away. Straight lines of constant time and straight lines of constant space coordinates therefore become hyperbolas, which appear to converge at points in the corners of the diagram. These points represent \"conformal infinity\" for space and time.\n\nPenrose diagrams are more properly (but less frequently) called Penrose–Carter diagrams (or Carter–Penrose diagrams), acknowledging both Brandon Carter and Roger Penrose, who were the first researchers to employ them. They are also called conformal diagrams, or simply spacetime diagrams.\n\nTwo lines drawn at 45° angles should intersect in the diagram only if the corresponding two light rays intersect in the actual spacetime.\nSo, a Penrose diagram can be used as a concise illustration of spacetime regions that are accessible to observation. The diagonal boundary lines of a Penrose diagram correspond to the \"infinity\" or to singularities where light rays must end. Thus, Penrose diagrams are also useful in the study of asymptotic properties of spacetimes and singularities. An infinite static Minkowski universe, coordinates formula_1 is related to Penrose coordinates formula_2 by:\nThe corners of the Penrose diamond, which represent the spacelike and timelike conformal infinities, are formula_4 from the origin.\n\nPenrose diagrams are frequently used to illustrate the causal structure of spacetimes containing black holes. Singularities are denoted by a spacelike boundary, unlike the timelike boundary found on conventional space-time diagrams. This is due to the interchanging of timelike and spacelike coordinates within the horizon of a black hole (since space is uni-directional within the horizon, just as time is uni-directional outside the horizon).\nThe singularity is represented by a spacelike boundary to make it clear that once an object has passed the horizon it will inevitably hit the singularity even if it attempts to take evasive action.\n\nPenrose diagrams are often used to illustrate the hypothetical Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting two separate universes in the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole solution. The precursors to the Penrose diagrams were Kruskal–Szekeres diagrams. (The Penrose diagram adds to Kruskal and Szekeres' diagram the conformal crunching of the regions of flat space-time far from the hole.) These introduced the method of aligning the event horizon into past and future horizons oriented at 45° angles (since one would need to travel faster than light to cross from the Schwarzschild radius back into flat spacetime); and splitting the singularity into past and future horizontally-oriented lines (since the singularity \"cuts off\" all paths into the future once one enters the hole).\n\nThe Einstein-Rosen bridge closes off (forming \"future\" singularities) so rapidly that passage between the two asymptotically flat exterior regions would require faster-than-light velocity, and is therefore impossible. In addition, highly blue-shifted light rays (called a \"blue sheet\") would make it impossible for anyone to pass through.\nThe maximally extended solution does not describe a typical black hole created from the collapse of a star, as the surface of the collapsed star replaces the sector of the solution containing the past-oriented \"white hole\" geometry and other universe.\n\nWhile the basic space-like passage of a static black hole cannot be traversed, the Penrose diagrams for solutions representing rotating and/or electrically charged black holes illustrate these solutions' inner event horizons (lying in the future) and vertically oriented singularities, which open up what is known as a time-like \"wormhole\" allowing passage into future universes. In the case of the rotating hole, there is also a \"negative\" universe entered through a ring-shaped singularity (still portrayed as a line in the diagram) that can be passed through if entering the hole close to its axis of rotation. These features of the solutions are, however, not stable and not believed to be a realistic description of the interior regions of such black holes; the true character of their interiors is still an open question.\n\n\n"}

If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.\n\nA similar game, referred to as a \"Luring Lottery\", was actually played by the editors of \"Scientific American\" in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number \"1\" written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.\n\nAccording to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated die with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send \"1\" if you roll \"1\". If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a \"1\", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard. Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.\n\nAlthough the magazine had previously discussed the concept of superrationality from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a googolplex). Some took this game further by filling their postcards with mathematical expressions designed to evaluate to the largest possible number in the limited space allowed. The magazine was unable to tell who won, and the monetary value of the prize would have been a minuscule fraction of a cent.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2941630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2941630", "title": "Primary deviance", "text": "Primary deviance\n\nPrimary Deviance is the initial stage in defining deviant behavior. Prominent Sociologist Edwin Lemert conceptualized primary deviance as engaging in the initial act of deviance. This is very common throughout society, as everyone takes part in basic form violation. Primary deviance does not result in a person internalizing a deviant identity, so one does not alter their self-concept to include this deviant identity. It is not until the act becomes labeled or tagged, that secondary deviation may materialize. According to Edwin Lemert, Primary Deviance is the acts that are carried out by the individual that allows them to carry the deviant label.\n\nParental support and the influence that Parents have on their children is one of the highest contributors to the behavior in adolescents. This is the primary stage in which behaviors, morals and values are learned and adopted. The guidance from parents is intended to mold and shape the behaviors that will qualify them to properly function in society. Praises, love, affection, encouragement and many other aspects of positive enforcement is one of the largest components of parental support. However, this is not all it takes to prevent deviant behaviors from forming and occurring.Parents must enforce \"effective discipline, monitoring, and problem-solving techniques.\" Children who come from homes where parents do not enforce positive behaviors and do not punish deviant behaviors appropriately, are children who are likely to engage in deviant behaviors. This type of bond is considered weak and cause the child to act out become deviant.\"\n\nStrong bonds with Parents is essential to the social group that the child will choose to associate with. When there is little to no control in the home, no positive enforcement from Parents, and the child does not have positive feelings towards schooling and education; they are more likely to associate with deviant peers. When associating with deviant peers, they are more accepting of deviant behaviors than if the child chose another social group. This is why it is vital the Parent-Child bond is strong because it will have an ultimate influence on the peers they choose and will have an influence on if they choose to engage in primary deviant behaviors as a juvenile.\n\nFrank Tannenbaum, theorized that Primary Deviant behaviors may be innocent or fun for those committing the act, but can become a nuisance and viewed as some form of delinquency to their parents, educators and even those in law enforcement. Tannenbaum distinguished two different types of deviancy. The first one being the initial act which the child considers to be of innocence but are labeled as deviant by the adult, this label is called Primary Deviancy. The second is after they've been initially labeled that they graduate to Secondary deviance in which both the adult and child agree that they are a deviant. Tannenbaum stated that the \"over dramatization\" of these deviant acts can cause one to be labeled and accept the label of being a deviant. Due to them accepting this label, they will eventually graduate from being a primary deviant to a secondary deviant thus committing greater crimes.\n\nThe most prevalent theory as it relates to Primary Deviance was developed in the early 1960s by a group of sociologists and was titled Labeling theory. The Labeling theory is a variant of Symbolic interactionism. Symbolic interactionism is \"a theoretical approach in sociology developed by the famous George Herbert Mead. It emphasizes the roles of symbols and language as core elements of human interaction. Labeling theory according to Labeling Theorists; is applied by those put in place to keep law and order, such as Police Officers, Judges; etc. Those are the people who typically label the people who have violated some law or another. The label 'Deviant' does not come from the person who has committed the act,but someone who is more powerful than the person being labeled. This theory has been tremendously criticized for not being able to explain what causes deviance early on. However, The Labeling Theory's main focus is to explain how Labeling relates and can cause Secondary deviance.\n\nRobert Merton developed the \"Anomie Theory\" which was dedicated specifically to the causes of deviance. The word Anomie was derived from the 'Godfather of Sociology' Emile Durkheim. Anomie is \"the breakdown of social norms that results from society's urging people to be ambitious but failing to provide them with legitimate opportunities to succeed\" \"\". Merton theorized that society places substantial emphasis on the importance of achieving success. However, this goal is not attainable for people of all social classes.Due to the absence of resources for people of lower social classes to achieve a great level of success, Merton theorized that people are forced to commit deviant acts. Merton has labeled the deviants behavior's as \"Innovation\"\n\nThe Social Learning theory theorizes that deviant behavior is learned through Social Interactions with other people. Edwin Sutherland developed an explanation for this theory which explains how one learns deviant behavior. This explanation is called differential association.\n\nDifferential Association theorizes that \"If an individual associates with people who hold deviant ideas more than with people who embrace conventional ideas, the individual is likely to become deviant.\" The person that is presenting the deviant act isn't always necessarily the deviant. The emphasis of differential association is that if someone is presented with the opportunity they will likely commit the act.Although some one may associate with both deviants and those who hold conventional ideas, if the deviant contacts outweigh the conventional contacts then deviancy is likely to occur. Differential Association's main key point refers particularly to the association aspect. Differential Association is theorized to be \"the cause of deviance.\n\nA person who was labeled as deviant was the infamous murderer Charles Manson. Manson was born to a 16 year old Kathleen Maddox on November 12, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson's Father, Colonel Scott left Manson's mother to raise him alone. When Charles was seven years old, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia after his mother was sentenced to 5 years in prison for armed robbery. Living with his aunt and uncle, Manson was given a more stable life that could allow him to be a positive contributor to society. However, the absence of his mother and the yearning he had for that motherly love and affection caused Manson to indulge in primary deviant behavior at a young age, which ultimately manifested into secondary deviance as he became older.\n\nFollowing the counsel of another uncle, a \"mountain man\" who lived in the mountains of Kentucky, Manson labeled himself a rebel. Manson's first act of deviancy began at the age of 9 years old when he set his school on fire and was sent to reform school. Throughout his adolescent, Manson was sent to several reform schools in hopes of rehabilitating him. Between 1942 and 1947 after her release from prison, Manson's mother was unable to properly care for him and was unsuccessful in finding him a foster home. She turned him over to the courts and allowed them to place him in an all boys school called Gibault School for Boys. Ten months later, Manson ran away from the Gibault School for Boys in hopes of rekindling a relationship he had longed for with his mother. After she rejected him Manson turned to a life of deviancy. Manson thrived off of high-consensus deviant acts such as burglary and theft. Manson was then sent to Father Flanagan's Boys' Home in 1949. After 4 days at Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, Manson ran away and pursued other deviant acts; such as auto theft, burglary, and armed robbery. Manson ran away 18 times from the National Training School for Boys where he alleged he was molested and beaten. This behavior in Manson's early years, caused this label of deviant to shadow him through his adult life, where he eventually graduated to Secondary deviance and eventually led the dangerous cult The Manson Family.\n\n"}
{"id": "23626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23626", "title": "Property", "text": "Property\n\nProperty, in the abstract, is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether physical or incorporeal, of a person's estate; or so belonging to, as in being owned by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a corporation or even a society. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.\n\nIn economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property).\n\nProperty that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.\n\nThe Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.\n\nIn sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between \"collective property\" and \"private property\" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.\n\nImportant widely recognized types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced. An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.\n\nOften property is defined by the code of the local sovereignty, and protected wholly or more usually partially by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The standards of proof concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically somewhat managerial. Some philosophers assert that property rights arise from social convention, while others find justifications for them in morality or in natural law.\n\nVarious scholarly disciplines (such as law, economics, anthropology or sociology) may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving contracts. Positive law defines such rights, and the judiciary can adjudicate and enforce property rights.\n\nAccording to Adam Smith, the expectation of profit from \"improving one's stock of capital\" rests on private property rights. Capitalism has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate wealth, and efficiently allocate resources based on the operation of markets. From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view on the effects of property laws on inequality:\n\nIn his text \"The Common Law\", Oliver Wendell Holmes describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first, possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability of another to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.\n\n\n\nBoth communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers mainly on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one class over another, giving rise to domination through the use of this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is \"hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned\" (as the Communist Manifesto puts it) by members of the proletariat. Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital (land, factories, resources, etc.) and private property (homes, material objects and so forth).\n\nMost legal systems distinguish between different types of property, especially between land (immovable property, estate in land, real estate, real property) and all other forms of property—goods and chattels, movable property or personal property, including the value of legal tender if not the legal tender itself, as the manufacturer rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish tangible and intangible property. One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements (immovable man-made things), and personal property (movable man-made things).\n\nIn common law, real property (immovable property) is the combination of interests in land and improvements thereto, and personal property is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land. These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of leases, licenses and easements.\n\nThroughout the last centuries of the second millennium, with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided into tangible property (such as cars and clothing) and intangible property (such as financial instruments, including stocks and bonds; intellectual property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks; digital files; communication channels; and certain forms of identifier, including Internet domain names, some forms of network address, some forms of handle and again trademarks).\n\nTreatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when inheritable, which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of public domain, to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due the inapplicability of scarcity to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum band and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used at all. Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.\n\nOf the following, only sale and at-will sharing involve no encumbrance.\n\nThe two major justifications given for original property, or the homestead principle, are effort and scarcity. John Locke emphasized effort, \"mixing your labor\" with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land. Benjamin Tucker preferred to look at the telos of property, i.e. What is the purpose of property? His answer: to solve the scarcity problem. Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to people's desires do they become property. For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land. Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce. For something to be economically scarce it must necessarily have the \"exclusivity property\"—that use by one person excludes others from using it. These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property. Intellectual property—incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements (musical compositions, novels, computer programs)—are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things don't have the exclusivity property (however, those who support a scarcity justification may still support other \"intellectual property\" laws such as Copyright, as long as these are a subject of contract instead of government arbitration). Thus even ardent propertarians may disagree about IP. By either standard, one's body is one's property.\n\nFrom some anarchist points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the \"property right\" requires enforcement by the state. Different forms of \"property\" require different amounts of enforcement: intellectual property requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little, while ownership of one's own body requires absolutely no state intervention. Some anarchists don't believe in property at all.\n\nMany things have existed that did not have an owner, sometimes called the commons. The term \"commons,\" however, is also often used to mean something quite different: \"general collective ownership\"—i.e. common ownership. Also, the same term is sometimes used by statists to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access (public property). Law in all societies has tended to develop towards reducing the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources, due to the tragedy of the commons, while critics argue that it leads to the 'exploitation' of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential network effects. These arguments have differing validity for different types of \"property\"—things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the tragedy of the commons. Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.\n\nThings that do not have owners include: ideas (except for intellectual property), seawater (which is, however, protected by anti-pollution laws), parts of the seafloor (see the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for restrictions), gases in Earth's atmosphere, animals in the wild (although in most nations, animals are tied to the land. In the United States and Canada wildlife are generally defined in statute as property of the state. This public ownership of wildlife is referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is based on The Public Trust Doctrine.), celestial bodies and outer space, and land in Antarctica.\n\nThe nature of children under the age of majority is another contested issue here. In ancient societies children were generally considered the property of their parents. Children in most modern societies theoretically own their own bodies but are not considered competent to exercise their rights, and their parents or guardians are given most of the actual rights of control over them.\n\nQuestions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of abortion, drugs and euthanasia.\n\nIn many ancient legal systems (e.g. early Roman law), religious sites (e.g. temples) were considered property of the God or gods they were devoted to. However, religious pluralism makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the religious body that runs them.\n\nIntellectual property and air (airspace, no-fly zone, pollution laws, which can include tradable emissions rights) can be property in some senses of the word.\n\nOwnership of land can be held separately from the ownership of rights over that land, including sporting rights, mineral rights, development rights, air rights, and such other rights as may be worth segregating from simple land ownership.\n\nOwnership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest (e.g. firearms, real property, personal property, animals). Persons can own property directly. In most societies legal entities, such as corporations, trusts and nations (or governments) own property.\n\nIn many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.\n\nIn the Inca empire, the dead emperors, who were considered gods, still controlled property after death.\n\nUnder United States law the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The \"Takings\" clause requires that the government (whether state or federal—for the 14th Amendment's due process clause imposes the 5th Amendment's takings clause on state governments) may take private property only for a public purpose, after exercising due process of law, and upon making \"just compensation.\" If an interest is not deemed a \"property\" right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply and the doctrine of sovereign immunity precludes relief. Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use. On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered \"regulatory takings.\" Moreover, conduct sometimes deemed only a nuisance or other tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe.\n\nThere exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare first possession theory of property, where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does. Perhaps one of the most popular is the natural rights definition of property rights as advanced by John Locke. Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis. Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes one’s labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be \"enough, and as good, left in common for others.\" (see Lockean proviso)\n\nFrom the RERUM NOVARUM, Pope Leo XIII wrote \"It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and thereafter to hold it as his very own.\"\n\nAnthropology studies the diverse systems of ownership, rights of use and transfer, and possession under the term \"theories of property.\" Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.\n\nIn every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and \"law\" where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:\n\nCommunal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit. Such arrangements can under certain conditions erode open access resources. This development has been critiqued by the tragedy of the commons.\n\nCorporate systems describe ownership as being attached to an identifiable group with an identifiable responsible individual. The Roman property law was based on such a corporate system. In a well-known paper that contributed to the creation of the field of law and economics in the late 1960s, the American scholar Harold Demsetz described how the concept of property rights makes social interactions easier:\n\nDifferent societies may have different theories of property for differing types of ownership. Pauline Peters argued that property systems are not isolable from the social fabric, and notions of property may not be stated as such, but instead may be framed in negative terms: for example the taboo system among Polynesian peoples.\n\nIn medieval and Renaissance Europe the term \"property\" essentially referred to land. After much rethinking, land has come to be regarded as only a special case of the property genus. This rethinking was inspired by at least three broad features of early modern Europe: the surge of commerce, the breakdown of efforts to prohibit interest (then called \"usury\"), and the development of centralized national monarchies.\n\nUrukagina, the king of the Sumerian city-state Lagash, established the first laws that forbade compelling the sale of property.\n\nThe Ten Commandments shown in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 stated that the Israelites were not to steal, but the connection between Bronze Age concepts of theft and modern concepts of property is suspect.\n\nAristotle, in \"Politics,\" advocates \"private property.\" He argues that self-interest leads to neglect of the commons. \"[T]hat which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual.\"\n\nIn addition he says that when property is common, there are natural problems that arise due to differences in labor: \"If they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and having all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property.\" (\"Politics, 1261b34\")\n\nCicero held that there is no private property under natural law but only under human law. Seneca viewed property as only becoming necessary when men become avarice. St. Ambrose latter adopted this view and St. Augustine even derided heretics for complaining the Emperor could not confiscate property they had labored for.\n\nThe canon law \"Decretum Gratiani\" maintained that mere human law creates property, repeating the phrases used by St. Augustine. St. Thomas Aquinas agreed with regard to the private consumption of property but modified patristic theory in finding that the private possession of property is necessary. Thomas Aquinas concludes that, given certain detailed provisions,\n\nThe principal writings of Thomas Hobbes appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following the war between forces loyal to King Charles I and those loyal to Parliament. In his own words, Hobbes' reflection began with the idea of \"giving to every man his own,\" a phrase he drew from the writings of Cicero. But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own? He concluded: My own can only truly be mine if there is one unambiguously strongest power in the realm, and that power treats it as mine, protecting its status as such.\n\nA contemporary of Hobbes, James Harrington, reacted to the same tumult in a different way: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of \"Oceana\", he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is one in which the commoners have half a nation's property, with crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. A much better situation (a stable republic) will exist once the commoners own most property, he suggested.\n\nIn later years, the ranks of Harrington's admirers included American revolutionary and founder John Adams.\n\nAnother member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir Robert Filmer, reached conclusions much like Hobbes', but through Biblical exegesis. Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are but children, whether obedient or unruly, and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.\n\nIn the following generation, John Locke sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced constitution in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmer's views essentially require that the Stuart family be uniquely descended from the patriarchs of the Bible, and since even in the late 17th century that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmer's views in his First Treatise on Government, freeing him to set out his own views in the Second Treatise on Civil Government. Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world, each of the unhappy residents of which are willing to create a social contract because otherwise \"the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure,\" and therefore the \"great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property.\" They would, he allowed, create a monarchy, but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. \"To this end\" (to achieve the previously specified goal), he wrote, \"it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the legislative power into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the state of nature.\"\n\nEven when it keeps to proper legislative form, though, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.\n\n\"It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases...\"\n\nNote that both \"persons \"and\" estates\" are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, inclusive of the \"power and will of a legislator.\" In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.\n\nTo explain the ownership of property Locke advanced a labor theory of property.\n\nIn contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far David Hume lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to Paris to work at the British embassy.\n\nIn contrast, one might think, to his polemical works on religion and his empiricism-driven skeptical epistemology, Hume's views on law and property were quite conservative.\n\nHe did not believe in hypothetical contracts, or in the love of mankind in general, and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. \"In general,\" he wrote, \"it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves.\" Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded, because they have come to be what they are as a result of human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments, because he conceived of the two as complementary: \"A regard for liberty, though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established government.\"\n\nTherefore, Hume's view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them. He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to avarice as \"the spur of industry,\" and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which \"destroy industry, by engendering despair.\"\n\n\"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive.\"\n— (Source: Adam Smith, \"The Wealth of Nations\", 1776, Book I, Chapter X, Part II.)\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.\n\nSection VIII, \"Primitive Accumulation\" of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures (sheep heading). Marx sees this \"Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large unlanded class which had to work for wages in order to survive. Marx asserts that Liberal theories of property are \"idyllic\" fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.\n\nCharles Comte, in \"Traité de la propriété\" (1834), attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the Bourbon Restoration. According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: \"firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles.\"\n\nComte, as Proudhon later did, rejected Roman legal tradition with its toleration of slavery. He posited a communal \"national\" property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person, and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the Lockean proviso – there was \"still enough, and as good left.\" Comte's analysis would be used by later theorists in response to the socialist critique on property.\n\nIn his 1840 treatise \"What is Property?\", Pierre Proudhon answers with \"Property is theft!\" In natural resources, he sees two types of property, \"de jure\" property (legal title) and \"de facto\" property (physical possession), and argues that the former is illegitimate. Proudhon's conclusion is that \"property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition.\"\n\nHis analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property (usufruct) is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.\n\nProudhon's theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as Mikhail Bakunin who modified Proudhon's ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like Karl Marx.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat's main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book \"Economic Harmonies\" (1850). In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for \"I may justly gift or trade this water to another person\". In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object. By \"value,\" Bastiat apparently means \"market value\"; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility. \"In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services.\"\n\nBastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to \"gratis\" satisfaction. Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind. \"Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property.\"\n\nThis transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.\n\nAndrew J. Galambos (1924–1997) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos’ concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man’s life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. (Because the English language is deficient in omitting the feminine from “man” when referring to humankind, it is implicit and obligatory that the feminine is included in the term “man”.)\n\nGalambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property.” Galambos defines property as having the following elements:\n\nProperty includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual’s life; this means children are not the property of their parents. and \"primary property\" (a person's own ideas).\n\nGalambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.\nFor example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual’s money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person’s primordial property.\n\nContemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and to enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as W.H. Hutt (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the \"quintessence of individualism\". On the other hand, those such as Richard Pipes regard Locke's arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke's work \"marked a regression because it rested on the concept of Natural Law\" rather than upon Harrington's sociological framework.\n\nHernando de Soto has argued that an important characteristic of capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system which clearly records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole formal system of property make possible:\n\nAll of the above, according to de Soto, enhance economic growth.\n\n\nProperty-giving (legal)\n\n\nProperty-taking (legal)\n\n\nProperty-taking (illegal)\nExclusive or discretionary relational constructs\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12541870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12541870", "title": "Sandra Laing", "text": "Sandra Laing\n\nSandra Laing (born 1955) is a South African woman who was classified as coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although she was the child of at least three generations of ancestors who had been regarded as white. At the age of 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her appearance disrupted her family and adult life.\n\nLaing was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film \"Skin\", directed by Anthony Fabian, which won numerous awards. In addition, she is the subject of the documentaries \"In Search of Sandra Laing\" (1977), directed by Anthony Thomas for the BBC, which was banned by the apartheid government of the time, \"Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey\" (2000), and \"Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing\" (2009).\n\nSandra Laing was born in 1955 to Sannie and Abraham Laing, Afrikaners in Piet Retief, a small conservative town in South Africa during the apartheid era, when laws governed officially established social castes of racial classification. She had darker skin than other members of her family, which seemed to become more obvious as she grew older. Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all white, but Sandra displayed the physiognomy of African ancestors of earlier generations, perhaps from the 18th century or more recent. Her family treated her as white, the same as their sons Adriaan and Leon, and together they all attended the Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nWhen Laing was 10 years old and at an all-white boarding school, the school authorities expelled her because of complaints from the parents of other students, based on her appearance: primarily her skin colour and the texture of her hair. They believed she was \"coloured\", a term for mixed-race people. She was expelled and escorted home by two police officers.\n\nSandra's parents fought several legal battles to have her classified as white, based on her documented ancestry through them. Her father underwent a blood-typing test for paternity in the 1960s, as DNA tests were not yet available. The results were compatible with his being her biological father, though such tests are extremely imprecise due to the small number of blood types that most people have.\n\nAfter the publicity, Laing found herself shunned by the white community, although she was re-classified as white again in 1966 when the law was changed to allow a person to be classified as white if both parents are classified as white. She attended a coloured boarding school away from her family and became immersed in the non-white world. Her only friends were the children of black employees. At the age of 16, Laing eloped to Swaziland with Petrus Zwane, a black South African who spoke Zulu. She was jailed for three months for illegal border-crossing. Her father threatened to kill her for the marriage and broke off contact with her. They never met again.\n\nAlthough she and her husband had two children, who were classified as \"coloured\", she was threatened with losing them unless she also was classified as \"coloured\", as a white parent could not raise coloured children. At the age of 26, she arranged for the change in race classification officially, although her father had refused permission earlier. Except for secret trips to see her mother when her father was out of the house, Laing was estranged from her family and struggled to survive economically. When her parents moved away from Piet Retief, the clandestine visits were no longer possible. Laing lost contact with her family completely. \n\nLaing and her husband separated due to the pressures they were under, and she put their children into government care for a period. Years later she married again, to Johannes Motloung, a Sotho-speaking man. They had three children together and she was able to reclaim her first two; all are now grown and with families of their own. Trying to reconcile with her family in the 1980s, Laing learned that her father had died and her mother Sannie refused to see her.\n\nIn 2000 the \"Johannesburg Times\" tracked down Laing to learn about her years since the end of apartheid. The newspaper helped her find her mother, and they were able to reconcile. Sannie was then in a nursing home. Sannie and the two shared time together before her mother's death in 2001.\n\nThe publicity helped Laing, her husband and family gain new housing; they now live in Leachville, new estates east of Johannesburg. In 2009, it was reported that Laing's brothers still refused to see her. She has said in interviews with \"The Guardian\" and \"Little White Lies\" that she continued to hope they would some day have a change of heart.\n\nDocumentary films have been made about Laing: \nand a dramatic film:\nbased on the book:\n\n\n\n"}

Scope neglect is a specific form of extension neglect.\n\nIn one study, respondents were asked how much they were willing to pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported they were willing to pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively. Other studies of willingness-to-pay to prevent harm have found a logarithmic relationship or no relationship to scope size.\n\nDaniel Kahneman explains scope neglect in terms of judgment by prototype, a refinement of the representativeness heuristic. \"The story [...] probably evokes for many readers a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape,\" and subjects based their willingness-to-pay mostly on that mental image.\n\n"}

Shootouts are often portrayed in action films and Western films.\n\nOn December 19, 1854, while trekking on a miner's trail along the North Fork of the American River, Dr. Bolivar Sparks, James McDonald and Captain Jonathan Davis were bushwhacked by an international band of bandits. The bandits, who included a Frenchman, two Americans, two Englishmen, four Mexicans and four Australians, had recently robbed and killed four American miners on December 18, 1854, and six Chinese miners on December 17, 1854. McDonald was killed instantly, and Dr. Sparks was fatally wounded, however Captain Davis, an Army veteran, pulled out both of his pistols and killed seven of the bandits in quick order. Out of bullets, Captain Davis, an expert fencer, pulled out his Bowie knife and killed four more of his attackers. The surviving bandits fled for their lives.

Prolonged shootout and chase between police in Norco, California, and five heavily armed bank robbers wearing military-style fatigues and armed with assault rifles, thousands of rounds of hollow-point bullets as well as various explosive and incendiary devices.\nPolice responded to a bank robbery call in Norco. Upon arriving the police were ambushed and outgunned. After the robbers unloaded over 300 rounds at police cruisers, the officers were forced to retreat behind their cruisers or nearby obstacles, all the while being fired upon. The suspects attempted to escape in their own vehicle. During this attempt, the driver of the suspects was killed by a stray police shot. The suspects then hijacked a nearby vehicle and became involved in a prolonged chase, in which the suspects shot at police and disabled and destroyed 33 police vehicles (as well as civilian cars) with explosives thrown from the back of a truck. The suspects also disabled a police helicopter by shooting at it. Later, the suspects lay in wait for police as they chased them, and ambushed them, resulting in the death of a police officer and wounding 2 others. Heavily outgunned, the police were pinned down until one officer arrived with an AR-15 carbine. After the police engaged the suspects with the AR-15, the suspects fled. One of the suspects was killed in the shootout, one during a later standoff with the police the next day, and three were later captured. 8 officers were also wounded during the events.\n\nDeaths: Suspects: 2; Police: 1\n\nOctober 20, 1981. An attempted armed robbery of a Brinks armored truck by members of the Weather Underground and Black Liberation Army resulted in a shootout and the deaths of 20 police officers and a Brinks security guard in Nyack, New York.

Drega, armed with a scoped AR-15, killed Phillips and another Trooper, Les Lord, who arrived on the scene as backup. Then he stole Phillips' police cruiser and drove to the offices of the Colebrook News and Sentinel, where he killed judge Vickie Bunnell and newspaper editor Dennis Joos, who tackled him in an attempt to disarm him.\n\nAfter this, Drega drove home to set his house on fire, then drove to Vermont where he opened fire and critically injured a Vermont trooper who had followed him after identifying the stolen NH police car. Eventually, Drega abandoned the vehicle at a Vermont farmhouse and ambushed a group of law enforcement officers from multiple agencies who had been sent to track him down. After a long shootout in which two more officers were injured, Drega was killed by Border Patrol agent Stephen Brooks and NH State Trooper Charles West, who were respectively armed with an M14 Rifle and Remington 870 shotgun.\n\nDeaths: Police: 2; Civilians: 2; Suspect: 1\n\nInjuries: Police: 3\n\nApril 20, 1999.

David Hernandez Arroyo attacked his ex-wife, Maribel Estrada, and her son outside the courthouse in Tyler, Texas. Arroyo was armed with a semi-automatic MAK-90 (AK-47 clone with a semi-automatic receiver) rifle. Mrs. Estrada was shot in the head and died; her son was shot in the leg but recovered. The shots immediately brought a response from nearby sheriff’s deputies and Tyler Police. Arroyo began trading gunfire with the officers, who were armed only with pistols, and forced them to retreat, wounding several of them. A passing civilian, Mark Allen Wilson, drew his own pistol and attempted to aid the officers but Arroyo was wearing body armor and Wilson's pistol failed to stop him; Wilson was shot and killed by Arroyo. Afterward, Arroyo jumped in his pickup and led police on a high-speed chase, exchanging gunfire along the way. Arroyo was eventually shot and killed by a responding officer armed with a CAR-15 rifle.\n\nDeaths: 3 (Arroyo, Estrada and Wilson)\nJuly 10, 2005, Los Angeles, California.

However, typical \"soft targets\" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include national monuments, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers, movie theaters, cafés and restaurants, places of worship, nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as railway stations, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives. Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected. Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, diplomatic missions, and power stations.\n\nTerrorist groups almost exclusively choose to strike soft targets. Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets. The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties. Clark Kent Ervin notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage. In 2011, while preparations were being made for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the deputy commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.\n\nMilitary and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent. For example, U.S. military general John Galvin noted in 1987 that Contra rebels switched to civilian targets rather than continuing the direct fighting against the Sandinista National Liberation Front.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4151168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4151168", "title": "Spolia", "text": "Spolia\n\nSpolia (Latin, 'spoils'), repurposed building stone for new construction, or decorative sculpture reused in new monuments, is the result of an ancient and widespread practice whereby stone that has been quarried, cut, and used in a built structure, is carried away to be used elsewhere. The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.\n\nArchaeologist Philip A. Barker gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from Wroxeter that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.\n\nThe practice was common in late antiquity. Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures. According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that their building stone could be repurposed by St. Wulstan to construct a cathedral in 1084. And the parish churches of Atcham, Wroxeter, and Upton Magna are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of Viroconium Cornoviorum.\n\nRoman examples include the Arch of Janus, the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the Arch of Constantine, the colonnade of Old Saint Peter's Basilica; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the Panagia Gorgoepikoos church in Athens); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in St Albans Cathedral, in much of the medieval architecture of Colchester, porphyry columns in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and the colonnade of the basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the hypostyle mosques of Kairouan, Gaza and Cordoba.\n\nAlthough the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for \"spoliation\" could not be found.\n\nInterpretations of spolia generally alternate between the \"ideological\" and the \"pragmatic.\" Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of \"spoils\" or \"booty\" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.\n\nSpolia had apotropaic spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at Ankara, where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of Roma and Augustus. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the \"daimones\" that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.\n\nLiz James extends Foss's observation in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in Miletus, Sardis, Ephesus and Pergamum: \"laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit,\" Liz James observes. \"Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes\".\n\n\nThere is a large modern literature on spolia, and the following list makes no claim to be comprehensive.\n"}

{"id": "1642877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1642877", "title": "Symmetric space", "text": "Symmetric space\n\nIn differential geometry, representation theory and harmonic analysis, a symmetric space is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold whose group of symmetries contains an inversion symmetry about every point. This can be made more precise, in either the language of Riemannian geometry or of Lie theory. The Riemannian definition is more geometric, and plays a deep role in the theory of holonomy. \nThe Lie-theoretic definition is more algebraic.\n\nIn Riemannian geometry, a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold is a symmetric space if and only if its curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport. More generally, a Riemannian manifold (\"M\", \"g\") is said to be symmetric if and only if, for each point \"p\" of \"M\", there exists an isometry of \"M\" fixing \"p\" and acting on the tangent space formula_1 of \"M\" at \"p\" by minus the identity. \nAny symmetric space is complete, and has a finite cover which is a simply connected symmetric space; thus these two characterizations in fact coincide up to finite covers. Both descriptions can also naturally be extended to the setting of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.\n\nFrom the point of view of Lie theory, a symmetric space is the quotient \"G\"/\"H\" of Lie group \"G\" by a Lie subgroup \"H\", where the Lie algebra formula_2 of \"H\" is also required to be the +1-eigenspace of an involution of the Lie algebra formula_3 of \"G\". \nAs stated, this characterization includes pseudo-Riemannian spaces as well as a Riemannian ones; extra algebraic conditions are needed to restrict to the Riemannian case.\n\nRiemannian symmetric spaces arise in a wide variety of situations in both mathematics and physics. They were first classified by Élie Cartan. Their central role in the theory of holonomy was discovered by Marcel Berger. They are important objects of study in representation theory and harmonic analysis as well as in differential geometry.\n\nLet \"M\" be a connected Riemannian manifold and \"p\" a point of \"M\". An automorphism \"f\" of a neighborhood of \"p\" is said to be a geodesic symmetry if it fixes the point \"p\" and reverses geodesics through that point, i.e. if \"γ\" is a geodesic and formula_4 then formula_5 It follows that the derivative of the map at \"p\" is minus the identity map on the tangent space of \"p\". On a general Riemannian manifold, \"f\" need not be isometric, nor can it be extended, in general, from a neighbourhood of \"p\" to all of \"M\".\n\n\"M\" is said to be locally Riemannian symmetric if its geodesic symmetries are in fact isometric. This is equivalent to the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor. \nA locally symmetric space is said to be a (globally) symmetric space if, in addition, its geodesic symmetries are defined on all of \"M\".\n\nThe Cartan–Ambrose–Hicks theorem implies that \"M\" is locally Riemannian symmetric if and only if its curvature tensor is covariantly constant, and furthermore that any simply connected, complete locally Riemannian symmetric space is actually Riemannian symmetric.\n\nAny Riemannian symmetric space \"M\" is complete and Riemannian homogeneous (meaning that the isometry group of \"M\" acts transitively on \"M\"). In fact, already the identity component of the isometry group acts transitively on \"M\" (because \"M\" is connected).\nLocally Riemannian symmetric spaces that are not Riemannian symmetric may be constructed as quotients of Riemannian symmetric spaces by discrete groups of isometries with no fixed points, and as open subsets of (locally) Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nBasic examples of Riemannian symmetric spaces are Euclidean space, spheres, projective spaces, and hyperbolic spaces, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. More examples are provided by compact, semi-simple Lie groups equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. An example of a non-Riemannian symmetric space is anti-de Sitter space.\n\nAny compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1 (with its usual metric of constant curvature −1) is a locally symmetric space but not a symmetric space.\n\nLet \"G\" be a connected Lie group. Then a symmetric space for \"G\" is a homogeneous space \"G\"/\"H\" where the stabilizer \"H\" of a typical point is an open subgroup of the fixed point set of an involution \"σ\" in \"Aut(G)\". Thus \"σ\" is an automorphism of \"G\" with \"σ\" = id and \"H\" is an open subgroup of the set\nBecause \"H\" is open, it is a union of components of \"G\" (including, of course, the identity component).\n\nAs an automorphism of \"G\", \"σ\" fixes the identity element, and hence, by differentiating at the identity, it induces an automorphism of the Lie algebra formula_3 of \"G\", also denoted by \"σ\", whose square is the identity. It follows that the eigenvalues of \"σ\" are ±1. The +1 eigenspace is the Lie algebra formula_2 of \"H\" (since this is the Lie algebra of \"G\"), and the −1 eigenspace will be denoted formula_9. Since \"σ\" is an automorphism of formula_3, this gives a direct sum decomposition\nwith\nThe first condition is automatic for any homogeneous space: it just says the infinitesimal stabilizer formula_2 is a Lie subalgebra of formula_3. The second condition means that formula_9 is an formula_2-invariant complement to formula_2 in formula_3. Thus any symmetric space is a reductive homogeneous space, but there are many reductive homogeneous spaces which are not symmetric spaces. The key feature of symmetric spaces is the third condition that formula_9 brackets into formula_2.\n\nConversely, given any Lie algebra formula_21 with a direct sum decomposition satisfying these three conditions, the linear map \"σ\", equal to the identity on formula_2 and minus the identity on formula_9, is an involutive automorphism.\n\nIf \"M\" is a Riemannian symmetric space, the identity component \"G\" of the isometry group of \"M\" is a Lie group acting transitively on \"M\" (\"M\" is Riemannian homogeneous). Therefore, if we fix some point \"p\" of \"M\", \"M\" is diffeomorphic to the quotient \"G/K\", where \"K\" denotes the isotropy group of the action of \"G\" on \"M\" at \"p\". By differentiating the action at \"p\" we obtain an isometric action of \"K\" on T\"M\". This action is faithful (e.g., by a theorem of Kostant, any isometry in the identity component is determined by its 1-jet at any point) and so \"K\" is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of T\"M\", hence compact. Moreover, if we denote by \"s\": M → M the geodesic symmetry of \"M\" at \"p\", the map\nis an involutive Lie group automorphism such that the isotropy group \"K\" is contained between the fixed point group of \"σ\" and its identity component (hence an open subgroup).\n\nTo summarize, \"M\" is a symmetric space \"G\"/\"K\" with a compact isotropy group \"K\". Conversely, symmetric spaces with compact isotropy group are Riemannian symmetric spaces, although not necessarily in a unique way. To obtain a Riemannian symmetric space structure we need to fix a \"K\"-invariant inner product on the tangent space to \"G\"/\"K\" at the identity coset \"eK\": such an inner product always exists by averaging, since \"K\" is compact, and by acting with \"G\", we obtain a \"G\"-invariant Riemannian metric \"g\" on \"G\"/\"K\".\n\nTo show that \"G\"/\"K\" is Riemannian symmetric, consider any point \"p\" = \"hK\" (a coset of \"K\", where \"h\" ∈ \"G\") and define\nwhere \"σ\" is the involution of \"G\" fixing \"K\". Then one can check that \"s\" is an isometry with (clearly) \"s\"(\"p\") = \"p\" and (by differentiating) d\"s\" equal to minus the identity on T\"M\". Thus \"s\" is a geodesic symmetry and, since \"p\" was arbitrary, \"M\" is a Riemannian symmetric space.\n\nIf one starts with a Riemannian symmetric space \"M\", and then performs these two constructions in sequence, then the Riemannian symmetric space yielded is isometric to the original one. This shows that the \"algebraic data\" (\"G\",\"K\",\"σ\",\"g\") completely describe the structure of \"M\".\n\nThe algebraic description of Riemannian symmetric spaces enabled Élie Cartan to obtain a complete classification of them in 1926.\n\nFor a given Riemannian symmetric space \"M\" let (\"G\",\"K\",\"σ\",\"g\") be the algebraic data associated to it. To classify the possible isometry classes of \"M\", first note that the universal cover of a Riemannian symmetric space is again Riemannian symmetric, and the covering map is described by dividing the connected isometry group \"G\" of the covering by a subgroup of its center. Therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that \"M\" is simply connected. (This implies \"K\" is connected by the long exact sequence of a fibration, because \"G\" is connected by assumption.)\n\nA simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is said to be irreducible if it is not the product of two or more Riemannian symmetric spaces. It can then be shown that any simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian product of irreducible ones. Therefore, we may further restrict ourselves to classifying the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nThe next step is to show that any irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric space \"M\" is of one of the following three types:\n\n1. Euclidean type: \"M\" has vanishing curvature, and is therefore isometric to a Euclidean space.\n\n2. Compact type: \"M\" has nonnegative (but not identically zero) sectional curvature.\n\n3. Non-compact type: \"M\" has nonpositive (but not identically zero) sectional curvature.\n\nA more refined invariant is the rank, which is the maximum dimension of a subspace of the tangent space (to any point) on which the curvature is identically zero. The rank is always at least one, with equality if the sectional curvature is positive or negative. If the curvature is positive, the space is of compact type, and if negative, it is of noncompact type. The spaces of Euclidean type have rank equal to their dimension and are isometric to a Euclidean space of that dimension. Therefore, it remains to classify the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact and non-compact type. In both cases there are two classes.\n\nA. \"G\" is a (real) simple Lie group;\n\nB. \"G\" is either the product of a compact simple Lie group with itself (compact type), or a complexification of such a Lie group (non-compact type).\n\nThe examples in class B are completely described by the classification of simple Lie groups. For compact type, \"M\" is a compact simply connected simple Lie group, \"G\" is \"M\"×\"M\" and \"K\" is the diagonal subgroup. For non-compact type, \"G\" is a simply connected complex simple Lie group and \"K\" is its maximal compact subgroup. In both cases, the rank is the rank of \"G\".\n\nThe compact simply connected Lie groups are the universal covers of the classical Lie groups formula_26, formula_27, formula_28 and the five exceptional Lie groups \"E\", \"E\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\".\n\nThe examples of class A are completely described by the classification of noncompact simply connected real simple Lie groups. For non-compact type, \"G\" is such a group and \"K\" is its maximal compact subgroup. Each such example has a corresponding example of compact type, by considering a maximal compact subgroup of the complexification of \"G\" which contains \"K\". More directly, the examples of compact type are classified by involutive automorphisms of compact simply connected simple Lie groups \"G\" (up to conjugation). Such involutions extend to involutions of the complexification of \"G\", and these in turn classify non-compact real forms of \"G\".\n\nIn both class A and class B there is thus a correspondence between symmetric spaces of compact type and non-compact type. This is known as duality for Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nSpecializing to the Riemannian symmetric spaces of class A and compact type, Cartan found that there are the following seven infinite series and twelve exceptional Riemannian symmetric spaces \"G\"/\"K\". They are here given in terms of \"G\" and \"K\", together with a geometric interpretation, if readily available. The labelling of these spaces is the one given by Cartan.\n\nA more modern classification uniformly classifies the Riemannian symmetric spaces, both compact and non-compact, via a Freudenthal magic square construction. The irreducible compact Riemannian symmetric spaces are, up to finite covers, either a compact simple Lie group, a Grassmannian, a Lagrangian Grassmannian, or a double Lagrangian Grassmannian of subspaces of formula_29 for normed division algebras A and B. A similar construction produces the irreducible non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces.\n\nAn important class of symmetric spaces generalizing the Riemannian symmetric spaces are pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces, in which the Riemannian metric is replaced by a pseudo-Riemannian metric (nondegenerate instead of positive definite on each tangent space). In particular, Lorentzian symmetric spaces, i.e., \"n\" dimensional pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces of signature (\"n\" − 1,1), are important in general relativity, the most notable examples being Minkowski space, De Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space (with zero, positive and negative curvature respectively). De Sitter space of dimension \"n\" may be identified with the 1-sheeted hyperboloid in a Minkowski space of dimension \"n\" + 1.\n\nSymmetric and locally symmetric spaces in general can be regarded as affine symmetric spaces. If \"M\" = \"G\"/\"H\" is a symmetric space, then Nomizu showed that there is a \"G\"-invariant torsion-free affine connection (i.e. an affine connection whose torsion tensor vanishes) on \"M\" whose curvature is parallel. Conversely a manifold with such a connection is locally symmetric (i.e., its universal cover is a symmetric space). Such manifolds can also be described as those affine manifolds whose geodesic symmetries are all globally defined affine diffeomorphisms, generalizing the Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian case.\n\nThe classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces does not extend readily to the general case for the simple reason that there is no general splitting of a symmetric space into a product of irreducibles. Here a symmetric space \"G\"/\"H\" with Lie algebra\nis said to be irreducible if formula_9 is an irreducible representation of formula_2. Since formula_2 is not semisimple (or even reductive) in general, it can have indecomposable representations which are not irreducible.\n\nHowever, the irreducible symmetric spaces can be classified. As shown by Katsumi Nomizu, there is a dichotomy: an irreducible symmetric space \"G\"/\"H\" is either flat (i.e., an affine space) or formula_3 is semisimple. This is the analogue of the Riemannian dichotomy between Euclidean spaces and those of compact or noncompact type, and it motivated M. Berger to classify semisimple symmetric spaces (i.e., those with formula_3 semisimple) and determine which of these are irreducible. The latter question is more subtle than in the Riemannian case: even if formula_3 is simple, \"G\"/\"H\" might not be irreducible.\n\nAs in the Riemannian case there are semisimple symmetric spaces with \"G\" = \"H\" × \"H\". Any semisimple symmetric space is a product of symmetric spaces of this form with symmetric spaces such that formula_3 is simple. It remains to describe the latter case. For this, one needs to classify involutions \"σ\" of a (real) simple Lie algebra formula_3. If formula_39 is not simple, then formula_3 is a complex simple Lie algebra, and the corresponding symmetric spaces have the form \"G\"/\"H\", where \"H\" is a real form of \"G\": these are the analogues of the Riemannian symmetric spaces \"G\"/\"K\" with \"G\" a complex simple Lie group, and \"K\" a maximal compact subgroup.\n\nThus we may assume formula_39 is simple. The real subalgebra formula_3 may be viewed as the fixed point set of a complex antilinear involution \"τ\" of formula_39, while \"σ\" extends to a complex antilinear involution of formula_39 commuting with \"τ\" and hence also a complex linear involution \"σ\"∘\"τ\".\n\nThe classification therefore reduces to the classification of commuting pairs of antilinear involutions of a complex Lie algebra. The composite \"σ\"∘\"τ\" determines a complex symmetric space, while \"τ\" determines a real form. From this it is easy to construct tables of symmetric spaces for any given formula_39, and furthermore, there is an obvious duality given by exchanging \"σ\" and \"τ\". This extends the compact/non-compact duality from the Riemannian case, where either \"σ\" or \"τ\" is a Cartan involution, i.e., its fixed point set is a maximal compact subalgebra.\n\nThe following table indexes the real symmetric spaces by complex symmetric spaces and real forms, for each classical and exceptional complex simple Lie group.\n\nFor exceptional simple Lie groups, the Riemannian case is included explicitly below, by allowing \"σ\" to be the identity involution (indicated by a dash). In the above tables this is implicitly covered by the case \"kl\"=0.\n\nIn the 1950s Atle Selberg extended Cartan's definition of symmetric space to that of weakly symmetric Riemannian space, or in current terminology weakly symmetric space. These are defined as Riemannian manifolds \"M\" with a transitive connected Lie group of isometries \"G\" and an isometry σ normalising \"G\" such that given \"x\", \"y\" in \"M\" there is an isometry \"s\" in \"G\" such that \"sx\" = σ\"y\" and \"sy\" = σ\"x\". (Selberg's assumption that σ should be an element of \"G\" was later shown to be unnecessary by Ernest Vinberg.) Selberg proved that weakly symmetric spaces give rise to Gelfand pairs, so that in particular the unitary representation of \"G\" on \"L\"(\"M\") is multiplicity free.\n\nSelberg's definition can also be phrased equivalently in terms of a generalization of geodesic symmetry. It is required that for every point \"x\" in \"M\" and tangent vector \"X\" at \"x\", there is an isometry \"s\" of \"M\", depending on \"x\" and \"X\", such that\n\n\nWhen \"s\" is independent of \"X\", \"M\" is a symmetric space. \nAn account of weakly symmetric spaces and their classification by Akhiezer and Vinberg, based on the classification of periodic automorphisms of complex semisimple Lie algebras, is given in .\n\nIf the identity component of the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold at a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then either the manifold is a locally Riemannian symmetric space, or it is in one of 7 families.\n\nA Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel complex structure compatible with the Riemannian metric is called a Hermitian symmetric space. Some examples are complex vector spaces and complex projective spaces, both with their usual Riemannian metric, and the complex unit balls with suitable metrics so that they become complete and Riemannian symmetric.\n\nAn irreducible symmetric space \"G\"/\"K\" is Hermitian if and only if \"K\" contains a central circle. A quarter turn by this circle acts as multiplication by \"i\" on the tangent space at the identity coset. Thus the Hermitian symmetric spaces are easily read off of the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there are four infinite series, namely AIII, BDI with \"p=2\", DIII and CI, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces.\n\nA Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel subbundle of End(T\"M\") isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions at each point, and compatible with the Riemannian metric, is called Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space.\n\nAn irreducible symmetric space \"G\"/\"K\" is quaternion-Kähler if and only if isotropy representation of \"K\" contains an Sp(1) summand acting like the unit quaternions on a quaternionic vector space. Thus the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are easily read off from the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there is exactly one for each complex simple Lie group, namely AI with \"p\" = 2 or \"q\" = 2 (these are isomorphic), BDI with \"p\" = 4 or \"q\" = 4, CII with \"p\" = 1 or \"q\" = 1, EII, EVI, EIX, FI and G.\n\nIn the Bott periodicity theorem, the loop spaces of the stable orthogonal group can be interpreted as reductive symmetric spaces.\n\n\n"}

It involves the acknowledgment of a language system that determines an individual's perception and symbolic action in the world.\n\nKenneth Burke develops the terministic screen in his book of essays called \"Language as Symbolic Action\" in 1966. He defines the concept as \"a screen composed of terms through which humans perceive the world, and that direct attention away from some interpretations and toward others\". Burke offers the metaphor to explain why people interpret messages differently, based on the construction of symbols, meanings, and, therefore, reality. Words convey a particular meaning, conjuring images and ideas that induce support toward beliefs or opinions. Receivers interpret the intended message through a metaphorical screen of their own vocabulary and perspective to the world. Certain terms may grab attention and lead to a particular conclusion. \"Language reflects, selects, and deflects as a way of shaping the symbol systems that allow us to cope with the world\". Every word chosen says something about the society we live in. The language we choose to use will be a representation of our reality, our world, our culture, and our beliefs, even without intention.\n\nBurke describes two different types of terministic screens: scientistic and dramatistic. Scientistic begins with a definition of a term; it describes the term as what it is or what it is not, putting the term in black and white. When defining, the essential function is either attitudinal or hortatory. In other words, the focus is on expressions or commands. When terms are treated as hortatory, they are developed. Burke comments on why he uses developed rather than another word. \"I say 'developed'; I do not say 'originating'. The ultimate origins of language seem to me as mysterious as the origins of the universe itself. One must view it, I feel, simply as the 'given' \". The dramatistic approach concerns action: thou shalt or thou shalt not. This screen directs the audience toward action based on interpretation of a term. Via terministic screens, the audience will be able to associate with the term or dissociate from it.\n\n\"Social constructionism is a metaphor that attempts to capture the way Burke viewed the nature of the world and the function of language therein.\" Symbols, terms, and language build our view of life. Social constructionism allows us to look at Burke's theory in terms we recognize and are comfortable with. \n\nWhen a person says gender, most people, based on their individual beliefs, normally think of male or female. However, some could think of intersex individuals. If someone says they think of male, female, and intersex, more would be reflected about the person based on their terminology. Still others would recognize gender as different from biological sex, and say they think of man, woman, and other genders. Another example occurs within the abortion controversy. A pro-choice advocate would most likely use the word \"fetus\" but pro-life advocates would use the word \"baby\", because the term stirs more realistic and relatable images and has a bearing on the legal status. Using the word \"baby\" versus \"fetus\" defines reality differently (scientistic) and guides people to act in a certain way (dramatistic) solely based on term selection that may be unconscious.\n\nWords are absolute for thought and action. According to Burke, individuals create terministic screens consciously and unconsciously, as they perceive the world and share perspectives. Burke contends these screens set up a network of beliefs through which all ideas will be interpreted. Communication scholar Paul Stob contends that the language we use is thus not just a direct reflection of our intelligence, but also of perception and culture. David Blakesley posits that the terministic screen enables the further understanding of rhetorical perspectives. In each of these ways, the terministic screen allows for concepts to be interpreted in different ways by different people and contribute to the complexity of meaning.\n\n"}

Roeder warns, 'As our world becomes more efficient and automated, there is less ‘friction’ to slow the momentum, which can lead to catastrophic results.’ The book examines the impact of Big Mo on finance, media, politics, wars, religion and science. Roeder, an ex-executive at UBS, bank, argues that momentum played an instrumental role in the Global Financial Crisis, and that it distorted decision-making in the lead up to the second Iraq War. He suggests that momentum ‘has become the zeitgeist of our time’\n\nThe Big Mo was described by the Financial Times as ‘A compelling book that journeys seamlessly from finances to the Iraq war, from oil prices and climate change to religion and pop culture in an effort to explain how we behave and why we are so easily led.’ The Australian broadcaster Phillip Adams, wrote, ‘In our personal, political and economic lives we seem to be swept along by circumstances. Our attempts to change direction are doomed. The Big Mo explains why.’\n\nThe Guardian’s Steven Poole criticized the book for 'overstretching the Newtonian-physics analogy'. Steven Matcham, writing in The Australian, said, ‘Speed and size define the events of our age. As news travels ever faster, its impact increases.

{"id": "3555585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3555585", "title": "Vertical farming", "text": "Vertical farming\n\nVertical farming is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and fertigation. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to greenhouses, where natural sunlight can be augmented with artificial lighting and metal reflectors.\n\nHydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.\n\nThe term \"vertical farming\" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book \"Vertical Farming\". His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about farming with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as \"vertical\" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures. Modern usage of the term \"vertical farming\" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.\n\nMixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect Ken Yeang. Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.\n\nEcologist Dickson Despommier argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less embodied energy and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.\n\nDespommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at Columbia University. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.\n\nSeveral companies have developed stacking recycled shipping containers in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. Freight Farms produces a \"leafy green machine\" that is a complete farm-to-table system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, LED lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12 m × 2.4 m shipping container. Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked \"growpods\". A similar farm is under construction in Oman. TerraFarms offer a proprietary system of 40 foot shipping containers, which include computer vision integrated with an artificial neural network to monitor the plants; and are remotely monitored from California. It is claimed that the TerraFarm system \"has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming\" with each unit producing the equivalent of \"three to five acres of farmland\", using 97% less water<ref name=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/18/cli-cha-los-ang\"></ref> through water recapture and harvesting the evaporated water through the air conditioning. the TerraFarm system was in commercial operation. Plants can exploit light that varies in intensity through the day. Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.\n\nLighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at Philips have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency. Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.\n\nOne of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in \"Life Magazine\" in 1909. The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in Rem Koolhaas's \"Delirious New York\". Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.\n\nEarly architectural proposals that contributge to VF include Le Corbusier's Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972). SITE's Highrise of Homes is a near revival of the 1909 \"Life Magazine\" Theorem. Built examples of tower hydroponicums are documented in \"The Glass House\" by John Hix. Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed. The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of greenhouse and hydroponic technology. Early hydroponicums integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These horticultural building systems evolved from greenhouse technology. The British Interplanetary Society developed a hydroponicum for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.\n\nThe Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' \"Hydroponics: The Bengal System,\" first published in 1951 with data from the then-East Pakistan, today's Bangladesh, and the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nLater precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).\n\nKen Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.\n\nDickson Despommier is a professor of environmental health sciences and microbiology. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.\n\nAlthough many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption. \n\nDespommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of Manhattan (about 2,000,000 people) using only of rooftop gardens. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:\n\nArchitectural designs were independently produced by designers Chris Jacobs, Andrew Kranis and Gordon Graff. \n\nMass media attention began with an article written in \"New York\" magazine, followed by others, as well as radio and television features.\n\nIn 2011 the Plant in Chicago was building an anaerobic digester into the building. This will allow the farm to operate off the energy grid. Moreover, the anaerobic digester will be recycling waste from nearby businesses that would otherwise go into landfills.\n\nIn 2013 the Association for Vertical Farming was founded in Munich, Germany.\n\nAs of 2014, Vertical Fresh Farms was operating in Buffalo, New York, specializing in salad greens, herbs and sprouts. In March the world’s then largest vertical farm opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania, built by Green Spirit Farms (GSF). The firm is housed in a single story building covering 3.25 hectares, with racks stacked six high to house 17 million plants. The farm was to grow 14 lettuce crops per year, as well as spinach, kale, tomatoes, peppers, basil and strawberries. Water is scavenged from the farm's atmosphere with a dehumidifier.\n\nA 2015 study utilized inexpensive metal reflectors to supply sunlight to the plants, reducing energy costs.\n\nKyoto-based Nuvege (pronounced “new veggie”) operates a windowless farm. Its LED lighting is tuned to service two types of chlorophyll, one preferring red light and the other blue. Nuvege produces 6 million lettuce heads a year.\n\nThe US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency operates an 18-story project that produces genetically modified plants that make proteins useful in vaccines.\n\nOpponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming. Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing food miles, the distance that food travels from farm to consumer. However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that \"food miles are, at best, a marketing fad.\" Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.\n\nSimilarly, if power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal.\n\nThe initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm. Office occupancy costs can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as Tokyo, Moscow, Mumbai, Dubai, Milan, Zurich, and Sao Paulo ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.\n\nThe developers of the TerraFarm system produced from second hand, 40 foot shipping containers claimed that their system \"has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming\".\n\nDuring the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light. Environmental writer George Monbiot calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15. An article in the Economist argued that \"even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough\" and \"the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive\".\n\nAs \"The Vertical Farm\" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.\n\nDepending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse produce can create more greenhouse gases than field produce, largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.\n\nGreenhouses commonly supplement CO levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields. Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO sources, such as those from furnaces, contain pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and ethylene which significantly damage plants. This means a vertical farm requires a CO source, most likely from combustion. Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO to leak into the atmosphere.\n\nGreenhouse growers commonly exploit photoperiodism in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over light pollution.\n\nHydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or wetlands would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.\n\nAs of 2012, Vertical Harvest was raising funds for an urban, small-scale vertical farm in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nMany of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or aeroponic growing methods.\n\nA 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.\n\nIt is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas. Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.\n\nUnlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.\n\nFurthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.\n\nDespommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. dwarf wheat which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients), year-round crops and \"stacker\" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block () would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of of traditional farming.\n\nCrops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought. \"Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century.\"\n\nVF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.\n\nUp to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state, due to VR's increased productivity.\n\nVertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources. Deforestation and desertification caused by agricultural encroachment on natural biomes could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.\n\nThe scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.\n\nWithdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address anthropogenic mass extinctions.\n\nTraditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be unethical given a viable alternative. One study showed that wood mouse populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming. In comparison, vertical farming would cause nominal harm to wildlife.\n\nTraditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as malaria and schistosomes, exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks. The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. \n\nFood security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty. Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.\n\nVertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.\n\nVertical farms could exploit methane digesters to generate energy. Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into biogas that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.\n\nVertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:\n\n\nDevelopers and local governments in multiple cities have expressed interest in establishing a vertical farm: Incheon (South Korea), Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), Dongtan (China), New York City, Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Seattle, Surrey, B.C., Toronto, Paris, Bangalore, Dubai, Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nIn 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and ecosystem services,\n\nIn 2010 the Green Zionist Alliance proposed a resolution at the 36th World Zionist Congress calling on Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael (Jewish National Fund in Israel) to develop vertical farms in Israel.\n\nIn 2012 the world's first commercial vertical farm was opened in Singapore, developed by Sky Greens Farms, and is three stories high. They currently have over 100 nine meter-tall towers.\n\nIn 2013 the Association for Vertical Farming (AVF) was founded in Munich (Germany). By May 2015 the AVF had expanded with regional chapters all over Europe, Asia, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. This organization unites growers and inventors to improve food security and sustainable development. AVF focuses on advancing vertical farming technologies, designs and businesses by hosting international info-days, workshops and summits.\n"}

It includes the rights of women in the United States to adequate sexual health, available contraception methods, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of women’s health issues in American culture is inspired by second-wave feminism in the United States. As a result of this movement, women of the United States began to question the largely male-dominated health care system and demanded a right to information on issues regarding their physiology and anatomy. The U.S. government has made significant strides to propose solutions, like creating the Women’s Health Initiative through the Office of Research on Women’s Health in 1991.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has developed a definition for sexual health in the United States based on the World Health Organization’s definition of sexual health. \n“Sexual health is a state of well-being in relation to sexuality across the life span that involves physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual dimensions. Sexual health is an intrinsic element of human health and is based on positive, equitable, and respectful approach to sexuality, relationships, and reproduction, that is free of coercion, fear, discrimination, stigma, shame, and violence.\"\n\nThe United States government recognizes that gender is a factor which plays a significant role in sexual health.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has identified national reproductive health goals including reducing the level of unintended pregnancy. Out of all the pregnancies reported in the United States, half are unplanned. Of the 62 million women in the U.S. who are able to have children, seven out of ten of these women are sexually active but do not want to become pregnant. Contraception is a major issue of women’s reproductive health. 86% of sexually active women practice some form of contraception and 30% of these women use a hormonal form of contraception. Women in the U.S. have more freedoms in deciding their use of contraceptives among other global nations, comparatively.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have significant pull over the decision-making process women must make when choosing different types of contraception. Women of the U.S. still rely on their healthcare providers for the majority of information they receive about contraceptive use. In order to help healthcare providers provide appropriate family planning care, the CDC published the US Medical Elibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,2010. The CDC lists methods of birth control under two categories: reversible and permanent.\n\n\n\nHormonal contraception is the most popular method of contraception among women in the United States. Women under the age of thirty more commonly use hormonal oral contraception as their preferred method. Hormonal contraceptives can be almost 100% effective when used perfectly, but in most cases it is used imperfectly. Oral hormonal contraceptives have an 8% failure rate. The popularity of oral hormonal contraceptives among women changes over the course of a year with 32% of women deciding to discontinue use of an oral hormonal contraceptive after one year of typical use.\n\nA large stigma exists among women on the topic of using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a form of contraception. The two types of IUDs that exist for current contraceptive use are Copper T 380A and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or Mirena. IUDs are underutilized by women in the United States with only 2% of women using IUD as an effective contraception. The effectiveness of a contraceptive is described in terms of perfect use and typical use. An IUD is different than most forms of contraception, as it is 100% effective in both cases of use. It is not possible to use IUDs improperly or inconsistently because they must be inserted inside of the uterus. Women in the United States have many fears about the use of IUDs, making them the less popular form of contraception. For many women in the U.S., IUDs are only an option when other traditional contraception methods have been used (hormonal birth control, barrier methods, etc.) or when a women has already had children. The fear surrounding use of an IUD stems from a lack of proper education on all available contraception options available to women in the U.S.. Women have cited being afraid of the quality of the device itself, placing the device inside their bodies voluntarily, and the time required to hold the device in place. There is a lack of knowledge about female anatomy and pregnancy prevention, even among women of the United States.\n\nA health objective of the United States government through The United States Public Health Service is to reduce the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases from the 1980s to today. The Centers for Disease Control is responsible for many studies on the topic of STDs as well as the effect of STDs on women and girls. STDs are defined by the CDC as “infections you can get from having sex with someone who has an infection”. There are more than twenty types of identifiable STDs caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses. Within one year in the United States there are an estimated 12 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases that occur. Of those 12 million cases there are 1.5 million cases of gonorrhea, 500,000 cases of genital herpes, and 110,000 cases of syphilis. Both women and men in the United States are affected by the STD epidemic. However, women have a stronger negative health reaction to some STDs than men. The negative health effects of STDs for women can include pelvic inflammatory disease (PIV), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, fetal and perinatal infections, complications to pregnancy, fetal loss, cervical cancer, and increased risk of tubal pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. Women in the U.S. are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs for a variety of reasons. Some STDs appear asymptomatic in women therefore women are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs than men. Like most health topics, there is a gap that exists in understanding the pathology of diseases in women versus men. Women receive less than adequate information about the prevalence of STDs as well as the symptoms of STDs.\n\nAs with contraception in the U.S., a stigma exists which prevents women from learning about all possible STDs and their treatment. A study by the Journal of Women’s Health identified STDs as a topic women would rather not talk about. Women, with their partners, do not commonly discuss STDs as well. The stigma surrounding STDs in the U.S. prevents women from discussing the topic even among healthcare provides, close friends, partners, and family. Younger women do not understand the risk that STDs can pose to them. For example, Chlamydia is one of the most common STDs affecting women and men in the United States. Women do not follow the recommendation that people should be screened for Chlamydia at least once per year. Most women do not even know any information about Chlamydia as an STD besides the fact that it is curable.\n\nSTD screening is most effective for identifying STDs in women, but is commonly underutilized by women in the U.S. Healthcare access and access to family planning clinics increases the probability that women will seek out and utilize STD screening. Screening is a form of testing healthy versus symptomatic people against traditional symptoms of STDs to determine STD prevalence. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has available clinics across the United States for the purpose of screening for STDs as well as other family planning services. Planned Parenthood suggests that sexually active women screen for STDs at least annually. A study by the Journal for Women’s Health identified a need for a knowledge campaign on STD screening targeting sexually active young women.\n"}
{"id": "144804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144804", "title": "Yin and yang", "text": "Yin and yang\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, yin and yang ( and ; \"yīnyáng\", lit. \"dark-bright\", \"negative-positive\") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as qi. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things . Included among these forms are humans. Many tangible dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (t'ai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the \"I Ching\".\n\nThe notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as Communities of Practice, but in this context yin and yang are better viewed as parts of an oneness that is expressed in the Tao. The term \"dualistic-monism\" or dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful paradox of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts. According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light). Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. taijitu symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.\n\nIn Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu ( 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.\n\nThese Chinese terms \"yin\" 陰 or 阴 \"shady side\" and \"yang\" 陽 or 阳 \"sunny side\" are linguistically analyzable in terms of Chinese characters, pronunciations and etymology, meanings, topography, and loanwords.\n\nThe Traditional Chinese characters and for the words \"yīn\" and \"yáng\" are both classified as radical- esphonetic characters, combining the semantically significant \"mound; hill\" radical or with the phonetic indicators \"ying\" and \"yang\" . The first phonetic \"yīn\" \"cloudy\" ideographically combines \"jīn\" \"now; present\" and \"yún\" \"cloud\", denoting the \"今 presence of 云 clouds\". The second phonetic \"yáng\" \"bright\" originally pictured the \"sun\" with \"rays coming down\". This phonetic is expanded with the \"sun\" radical into \"yáng\" 暘 \"rising sun; sunshine\". The \"mound; hill\" radical 阝full forms semantically specify \"yīn\" 陰 \"shady/dark side of a hill\" and \"yáng\" 陽 \"sunny/light side of a hill\".\n\nThe Simplified Chinese characters and for \"yīn\" and \"yáng\" combine the same \"hill\" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic \"yuè\" \"moon\" and \"rì\" \"sun\", graphically denoting \"shady side of a hill\" and \"sunny side of a hill\". Compare the Classical Chinese names (which contain \"tài\" \"great\") for these two heavenly bodies: \"Tàiyīn\" \"moon\" and \"Tàiyáng\" \"sun\".\n\nThe Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first tone \"yīn\" \"shady; cloudy\" or sometimes falling fourth tone \"yìn\" \"to shelter; shade\", and 陽 or 阳 \"sunny\" is always pronounced with rising second tone \"yáng\".\n\nSinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) \"Qieyun\" rhyme dictionary and later rhyme tables, which was subsequently used to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology from rhymes in the (11th-7th centuries BCE) \"Shijing\" and phonological components of Chinese characters. Reconstructions of Old Chinese have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.\n\nCompare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions of \"yīn\" 陰 and \"yáng\" 陽:\n\nSchuessler gives probable Sino-Tibetan etymologies for both Chinese words.\n\n\"Yin\" < *\"ʔəm\" compares with Burmese \"ʔum\" \"overcast; cloudy\", Adi \"muk-jum\" \"shade\", and Lepcha \"so'yǔm\" \"shade\"; and is probably cognate with Chinese \"àn\" < *\"ʔə̂mʔ\" \"dim; gloomy\" and \"qīn\" < *\"khəm\" \"blanket\"\n\n\"Yang\" < *\"laŋ\" compares with Lepcha \"a-lóŋ\" \"reflecting light\", Burmese \"laŋ\" \"be bright\" and \"ə-laŋ\" \"light\"; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese \"chāng\" < *\"k-hlaŋ\" \"prosperous; bright\"; \"bǐng\" < *\"braŋʔ\" \"bright\"; \"liàng\" < \"*raŋh\" \"(pale) light\"; \"lǎng\" < \"raŋʔ\" \"brilliant light\"; \"míng\" < \"mraŋ\" \"bright, become light, enlighten\". Schuessler surmises that those items either are areal words (cf. Tai \"plaŋ\" \"bright\") or belong to an Austroasiatic word family (cf. Proto-Viet-Muong \"hlaŋ\"); owing to \"the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function\".\n\n\"Yin\" and \"yang\" are semantically complex words. \n\nA reliable Chinese-English dictionary gives the following translation equivalents.\nYin 陰 or 阴 Noun ① [philosophy] negative/passive/female principle in nature ② Surname Bound morpheme ① the moon ② shaded orientation ③ covert; concealed; hidden ④ ⑦ negative ⑧ north side of a hill ⑨ south bank of a river ⑩ reverse side of a stele ⑪in intaglio Stative verb ① overcast \nYang 陽 or 阳 Bound morpheme ① [Chinese philosophy] positive/active/male principle in nature ②the sun ④ in relief ⑤ open; overt ⑥ belonging to this world ⑦ [linguistics] masculine ⑧ south side of a hill ⑨ north bank of a river \n\nThe compound \"yin-yang\" 陰陽 or 阴阳 means \"yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.\".\n\nThe sinologist Rolf Stein etymologically translates Chinese \"yin\" 陰 \"shady side (of a mountain)\" and \"yang\" 陽 \"sunny side (of a mountain)\" with the uncommon English geographic terms \"ubac\" \"shady side of a mountain\" and \"adret\" \"sunny side of a mountain\" (which are of French origin)...\n\nMany Chinese place names or toponyms contain the word \"yang\" \"sunny side\" and a few contain \"yin\" \"shady side\". In China, as elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.\n\n\"Yang\" refers to the \"south side of a hill\" in Hengyang 衡陽, which is south of Mount Heng 衡山 in Hunan province, and to the \"north bank of a river\" in Luoyang 洛陽, which is located north of the Luo River 洛河 in Henan.\nSimilarly, \"yin\" refers to \"north side of a hill\" in Huayin 華陰, which is north of Mount Hua 華山 in Shaanxi province.\n\nIn Japan, the characters are used in western Honshu to delineate the north-side San'in region 山陰 from the south-side San'yō region 山陽, separated by the Chugoku mountain range 中国山地.\n\nEnglish \"yin\", \"yang\", and \"yin-yang\" are familiar loanwords of Chinese origin.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines:\nyin (jɪn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese \"yīn\" shade, feminine; the moon.] \na. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also \"attrib\". or as \"adj\"., and \"transf\". Cf. yang. \nb. \"Comb\"., as yin-yang, the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as yin-yang symbol, a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively \"yin\" and \"yang\", each containing a 'seed' of the other. \nyang (jæŋ) Also Yang. [Chinese \"yáng\" yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] \na. In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also \"attrib.\" or as \"adj.\" Cf. yin.\nb. \"Comb.\": yang-yin = \"yin-yang\" s.v. yin b.\n\nFor the earliest recorded \"yin and yang\" usages, the \"OED\" cites 1671 for \"yin\" and \"yang\", 1850 for \"yin-yang\", and 1959 for \"yang-yin\".\n\nIn English, \"yang-yin\" (like \"ying-yang\") occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword \"yin-yang\"— yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some \"yangyin\" collocations, such as 洋銀 (lit. \"foreign silver\") \"silver coin/dollar\", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the \"Hanyu Da Cidian\") enter \"yangyin\" *陽陰. While \"yang\" and \"yin\" can occur together in context, \"yangyin\" is not synonymous with \"yinyang\". The linguistic term \"irreversible binomial\" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English \"cat and mouse\" (not *\"mouse and cat\") and \"friend or foe\" (not *\"foe or friend\"). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, \"tiandi\" 天地 \"heaven and earth\" and \"nannü\" 男女 \"men and women\". \"Yinyang\" meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why \"yinyang\" violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say \"yinyang\" than \"yangyin\"), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since \"yinyang\" first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".\n\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with Five Elements as part of the School of Naturalists. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\" He then discusses Zou Yan (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history. Particularly under Confucianism, yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\nThe notion of yin and yang has led to the persecution and extinction of Asian sun goddess cults outside of Korea and Japan.\n\nIn Daoist philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the Tao Te Ching at chapter 42.  It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a mutual whole (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is to postulate the notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood. Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:\n\nYin is the black side with the white dot in it, and yang is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.\n\nThe yin-yang symbol, having no \"officially standardized\" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it \"frivolous\" (that is, \"merely\" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos). \n\nYin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself. If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has vacuity.\n\nIn the \"I Ching\", originally a divination manual of the Western Zhou period (c. 1000–750 BC), yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊). These are then combined into trigrams, which are more yang (\"e.g.\" ☱) or more yin (\"e.g.\" ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (\"e.g.\", ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (\"e.g.\" ䷕ and ䷟). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the swastika, common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in Celtic art and Roman shield markings.\n\nTaijiquan (Chinese: 太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. Wu Jianquan, a famous Chinese martial arts teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:\n\n\nFootnotes\nWorks cited\n\n"}
