{"id": "823330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=823330", "title": "Aish HaTorah", "text": "Aish HaTorah\n\nAish HaTorah (, \"Esh HaTorah\", \"Fire of the Torah\") is a Jewish Orthodox organization and yeshiva.\n\nAish HaTorah was established in Jerusalem by Rabbi Noah Weinberg in 1974, after he left the Ohr Somayach yeshiva, which he had previously co-founded. The organization worked to engage young Jews in discussion and study about the relevance of their heritage. It later expanded worldwide, and continues promotes its extensive adult education classes.\n\nAish HaTorah describes itself as blending the traditions of the Lithuanian yeshivas with the doctrines of Hasidism. Weinberg himself was a product of Lithuanian schools but he was also a grandson of the Slonimer Rebbe. His teachings reflect influences of both schools as well as certain facets of the Kabbalah of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Vilna Gaon and others.\n\nAish HaTorah describes itself as pro-Israel and encourages Jewish people to visit Israel and connect to the land and its history. The organization's stated mission is \"providing opportunities for Jews of all backgrounds to discover their heritage.\"\n\nThe name Aish HaTorah, literally \"Fire [of] the Torah\", was inspired by the Talmudic story of Rabbi Akiva, the once illiterate 40-year-old shepherd who subsequently became the most famous sage of the Mishnah. Elie Wiesel said, \"Aish HaTorah means to me the passion of teaching, the passion of learning. The study of Torah, the source of Jewish values, is the way to Jewish survival.\"\n\nAish HaTorah operates about 35 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, Shabbat and Jewish holiday programs, and community building.\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Aish HaTorah yeshiva offers both beginners' drop-in classes and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. It has a high-tech main campus and outreach center that features a rooftop vista overlooking the Temple Mount, and the Kirk Douglas Theatre, which houses a dramatic film presentation of the Jewish contribution to humanity. An \"Explorium\" of Jewish History is scheduled to open in 2013, designed to accommodate 300,000 visitors annually.\n\nAish HaTorah runs the Discovery Seminar. The four-hour seminar reviews Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish philosophy questions.\n\nIn 2005 Aish HaTorah produced a documentary film, \"Inspired\" which chronicles the lives of selected baalei teshuvah (\"returnees to Jewish observance\"). Aish HaTorah believes that the high rate of intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews has diluted the Jewish people’s vitality. \"Inspired\" was produced to encourage more observant Jews to share their positive Jewish religious experiences of Jewish life with non-observant Jews, as a way to strengthen the baal teshuva movement and revitalize Jewish life.\n\nIn 2007 Aish released a sequel, \"Inspired Too\". These films paved the way for Project Inspire, the grassroots organization that helps inspire Orthodox Jews to reach out to non-affiliated Jews to teach them about their heritage. Once an offshoot of Aish HaTorah, Project Inspire is now an independent organization under the umbrella of Aish Global.\n\nIn 2008, the Clarion Project, an organization that shares staff, fundraising sources and an address with Aish HaTorah, and has been linked in media reports with Aish HaTorah, distributed its film called \"Obsession.\" The film had been criticized for being unfair in its portrayal of Muslims as violent. The film was sent to more than 28 million people in the United States in anticipation of the United States presidential election. Aish HaTorah denied any connection to the film. The Council on American–Islamic Relations filed a complaint about the film with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn 2012, the Clarion Project released a film called . The film was produced by Raphael Shore, who works for Aish HaTorah. The film was called \"Islamophobic\" by The Forward.\n\nWhen the Israeli Foreign Ministry sought to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses, it worked with Aish HaTorah to develop the Hasbara Fellowships. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses.\n\nIn August 2016, the Israeli government announced an Israel-Diaspora outreach program called The Israel-Diaspora Initiative. The program partners were announced as Chabad and Olami Worldwide, an organization that works closely with Aish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "205522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205522", "title": "Ann Coulter", "text": "Ann Coulter\n\nAnn Hart Coulter (; born December 8, 1961) is an American conservative social and political commentator, writer, syndicated columnist, and lawyer.\n\nBorn in New York City, Coulter was raised in New Canaan, Connecticut. She deepened her conservative interests while studying history at Cornell University, where she helped found \"The Cornell Review\". She subsequently embarked on a career as a law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration. Her first book concerned the Bill Clinton impeachment, and sprang from her experience writing legal briefs for Paula Jones's attorneys, as well as columns she wrote about the cases.\n\nCoulter's syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate appears in newspapers, and is featured on conservative websites. Coulter has written 12 best-selling books.\n\nAnn Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent of Irish–German heritage, who was a native of Albany, New York; and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a native of Paducah, Kentucky. Her family later moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised. She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who idolized Joseph McCarthy. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since kindergarten. To prepare for arguments, she read books like \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" by Barry Goldwater.\n\nAt age 14, Coulter visited her older brother in New York City, where he attended law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by Milton Friedman and William E. Simon. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, he and his friends took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer. She graduated from New Canaan High School in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002, while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet \"The Washington Post\" columnist Lloyd Grove cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in New Canaan, Connecticut, prior to the 1980 Presidential election. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.\n\nWhile attending Cornell University, Coulter helped found \"The Cornell Review\", and was a member of the Delta Gamma national sorority. She graduated \"cum laude\" from Cornell in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and received her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1988, where she was an editor of the \"Michigan Law Review\". At Michigan, Coulter was president of the local chapter of the Federalist Society and was trained at the National Journalism Center.\n\nAfter law school, Coulter served as a law clerk, in Kansas City, for Pasco Bowman II of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. After a short time working in New York City in private practice, where she specialized in corporate law, Coulter left to work for the United States Senate Judiciary Committee after the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994. She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the deportation of aliens convicted of felonies. She later became a litigator with the Center for Individual Rights.\n\nIn 2000, Coulter considered running for Congress in Connecticut on the Libertarian Party ticket to serve as a spoiler in order to throw the seat to the Democratic candidate and see that Republican Congressman Christopher Shays failed to gain re-election, as a punishment for Shays' vote against Clinton's impeachment. The leadership of the Libertarian Party of Connecticut, after meeting with Coulter, declined to endorse her. As a result, her self-described \"total sham, media-intensive, third-party Jesse Ventura campaign\" did not take place. Shays subsequently won the election, and held the seat until 2009.\n\nCoulter's career is highlighted by the publication of twelve books, as well as the weekly syndicated newspaper column that she publishes. She is particularly known for her polemical style, and describes herself as someone who likes to \"stir up the pot. I don't pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\".\nShe has been compared to Clare Boothe Luce, one of her idols, for her satirical style. She also makes numerous public appearances, speaking on television and radio talk shows, as well as on college campuses, receiving both praise and protest. Coulter typically spends 6–12 weeks of the year on speaking engagement tours, and more when she has a book coming out.\nIn 2010, she made an estimated $500,000 on the speaking circuit, giving speeches on topics of modern conservatism, gay marriage, and what she describes as the hypocrisy of modern American liberalism. During one appearance at the University of Arizona, a pie was thrown at her. Coulter has, on occasion, in defense of her ideas, responded with inflammatory remarks toward hecklers and protestors who attend her speeches.\n\nCoulter is the author of twelve books, many of which have appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, with a combined 3 million copies sold .\n\nCoulter's first book, \"\", was published by Regnery Publishing in 1998 and made the New York Times Bestseller list. It details Coulter's case for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\nHer second book, \"\", published by Crown Forum in 2002, reached the number one spot on \"The New York Times\" non-fiction best seller list. In \"Slander\", Coulter argues that President George W. Bush was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of \"Slander\" was called into question by then-comedian and author, later Democratic U.S. Senator from Minnesota, Al Franken; he also accused her of citing passages out of context. Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts. Coulter responded to criticisms in a column called \"Answering My Critics\".\n\nIn her third book, \"\", also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the Cold War—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers-Alger Hiss affair, and Ronald Reagan's challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to \"tear down this wall\"—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.\nShe also argues that the correct identification of Annie Lee Moss, among others, as communists was misreported by the liberal media.\n\"Treason\" was published in 2003, and spent 13 weeks on the Best Seller list.\n\nCrown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, \"How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter\".\n\nCoulter's fifth book, published by Crown Forum in 2006, is \"\".\nIn it, she argues, first, that American liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself.\n\"Godless\" debuted at number one on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. Some passages in the book match portions of others' writings published at an earlier time (including newspaper articles and a Planned Parenthood document), leading John Barrie of iThenticate to assert that Coulter had engaged in \"textbook plagiarism\".\n\nCoulter's \"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans\" (Crown Forum), published in October 2007, and \"\" (Crown Forum), published on January 6, 2009, both also achieved best-seller status.\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Crown Forum published her eighth book \"\". Coulter said she based this book heavily on the work of French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon, who wrote on mass psychology, and in it she argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.\n\nHer ninth book, published September 25, 2012, is \"\". It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.\n\nCoulter's tenth book, \"Never Trust a Liberal Over 3 – Especially a Republican\", was released October 14, 2013. It is her second collection of columns and her first published by Regnery since her first book, \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\". Coulter published her eleventh book, \"\" on June 1, 2015. The book addresses illegal immigration, amnesty programs, and border security in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: \"Human Events Online\", WorldNetDaily, Townhall.com, VDARE, \"FrontPage Magazine\", \"Jewish World Review\" and her own website. Her syndicator says, \"Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers\".\n\nIn 1999, Coulter worked as a regular columnist for \"George\" magazine. Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine \"Human Events\". In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, Constitutional issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the executive branch.\n\nIn 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for \"National Review Online\" (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the September 11 attacks. On the national television show \"Politically Incorrect\", Coulter accused \"NRO\" of censorship and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. Jonah Goldberg, editor-at-large of \"NRO\", said, \"We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement].\"\n\nCoulter contracted with \"USA Today\" to cover the 2004 Democratic National Convention. She wrote one article that began, \"Here at the Spawn of Satan convention in Boston ...\" and referred to some unspecified female attendees as \"corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons\". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over \"basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable\". An explanatory article by the paper went on to say \"Coulter told the online edition of \"Editor & Publisher\" magazine that \"USA Today\" doesn't like my \"tone\", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'\" \"USA Today\" replaced Coulter with Jonah Goldberg, and Coulter published it instead on her website.\n\nIn August 2005, the \"Arizona Daily Star\" dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: \"Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives\".\n\nIn July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, \"\". After \"The Augusta Chronicle\" dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained: \"it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about\". Ryan also stated that \"pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around\".\n\nCoulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network MSNBC as a legal correspondent. She later appeared on CNN and Fox News. Coulter went on to make frequent guest appearances on many television and radio talk shows.\n\nCoulter appeared in three films released during 2004. The first was \"Feeding the Beast\", a made-for-television documentary on the \"24-Hour News Revolution\". The other two films were \"FahrenHYPE 9/11\", a direct-to-video documentary rebuttal of Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 911\", and \"Is It True What They Say About Ann?\", a documentary on Coulter containing clips of interviews and speeches. In 2015, Coulter had a cameo as the Vice President in the made-for-TV movie \"\".\n\nCoulter is a Christian and belongs to the Presbyterian denomination. She is a conservative columnist and has described herself as a \"typical, immodest-dressing, swarthy male-loving, friend-to-homosexuals, ultra-conservative.\" She is a registered Republican and former member of the advisory council of GOProud since August 9, 2011.\n\nShe supports the display of the Confederate flag. She came to the defense of Milo Yiannopoulos, of whom she is a friend, for his comments defending pederasty.\n\nCoulter believes \"Roe v. Wade\" should be overturned and left to the states. She is anti-abortion, but believes there should be an exception if a woman is raped. However, in 2015, she prioritized the issue of immigration, stating: \"I don't care if [Trump] wants to perform abortions in White House after this immigration policy paper\".\n\nCoulter was raised by a Catholic father and Protestant mother. At one public lecture she said: \"I don't care about anything else; Christ died for my sins, and nothing else matters.\" She summarized her view of Christianity in a 2004 column, saying, \"Jesus' distinctive message was: People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day, because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.\" She then mocked \"the message of Jesus... according to liberals\", summarizing it as \"something along the lines of 'be nice to people, which, in turn, she said \"is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity.\"\n\nConfronting some critics' views that her content and style of writing is unchristian, Coulter said that she is \"a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it.\" She also said: \"Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian means that I am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy—you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism\". In \"\", Coulter characterized the theory of evolution as bogus science, and contrasted her beliefs to what she called the left's \"obsession with Darwinism and the Darwinian view of the world, which replaces sanctification of life with sanctification of sex and death\". Coulter subscribes to intelligent design, an antievolution ideology.\n\nCoulter endorsed the period of NSA warrantless surveillance from 2001 to 2007. During a 2011 appearance on Stossel, she said \"PATRIOT Act, fantastic, Gitmo, fantastic, waterboarding, not bad, though torture would've been better.\" She criticized Rand Paul for \"this anti-drone stuff\".\n\nCoulter opposes hate crime laws, calling them \"unconstitutional\". She also stated that \"Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others.\"\n\nCoulter has criticized former president George W. Bush's immigration proposals, saying they led to \"amnesty\". In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:\n\nCoulter strongly opposes the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Regarding illegal immigration, she strongly opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants, and at the 2013 CPAC said she has now become \"a single-issue voter against amnesty\".\n\nIn June 2018, during the controversy caused by the Trump administration family separation policy, Coulter dismissed immigrant children as \"child actors weeping and crying\" and urged Trump not to \"fall for it\".\n\nCoulter opposes same-sex marriage, opposes \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", and supports federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman. She insists that her opposition to same-sex marriage \"wasn't an anti-gay thing\" and that \"It's genuinely a pro-marriage position to oppose gay marriage\". In an April 1, 2015, column, Coulter declared that liberals had \"won the war on gay marriage (by judicial fiat)\".\n\nCoulter also opposes civil unions and privatizing marriage. When addressed with the issue of rights granted by marriage, she said, \"Gays already can visit loved ones in hospitals. They can also visit neighbors, random acquaintances, and total strangers in hospitals—just like everyone else. Gays can also pass on property to whomever they would like\". She disagreed with the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 \"Lawrence v. Texas\" ruling, stating there was no right to sodomy written in the Constitution and that under federalism each individual state and territory would have to repeal their sodomy laws. She stated she opposed banning same-sex sexual intercourse. She also stated that same-sex sexual intercourse was already protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prevents police from going into your home without a search warrant or court order.\n\nIn regard to \"Romer v. Evans\", in which the United Supreme Court overturned Article II, Section 30b of the Colorado Constitution, which prohibited the \"State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.\", Coulter described the ruling as \"they couldn't refuse to give affirmative action benefits to people who have sodomy\". She also disagreed with repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, stating that it is not an \"anti-gay position; it is a pro-military position\" because \"sexual bonds are disruptive to the military bond\". She also stated that there is \"no proof that all the discharges for homosexuality involve actual homosexuals.\" On April 1, 2015, in a column, she expressed support for Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act and said it was an \"apocryphal\" assertion to claim the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would be used to discriminate against LGBT people. She expressed her support for the \"Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission\" ruling.\n\nCoulter has expressed her opposition to treatment of LGBT people in the countries of Cuba, People's Republic of China, and Saudi Arabia. Coulter opposes publicly funded sex reassignment surgery. She supports the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act and opposes transgender individuals using bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. She says her opposition to bathroom usage corresponding to gender identity has nothing to do with transgender people, but cisgendered \"child molesters\" who \"now has the right to go into that bathroom.\" She supports banning transgender military service personnel from the United States military.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She considers herself \"the Judy Garland of the Right\". In the last few years, she has attracted many LGBT fans, namely gay men and drag queens.\n\nAt the 2007 CPAC, Coulter said, \"I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing Mitt Romney's position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers\", and \"Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against.\" She added, \"I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us.\"\n\nIn Coulter's 2007 book \"If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans\", in the chapter \"Gays: No Gay Left Behind!\", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of GOProud, where she commented that same-sex marriage \"is not a civil right\". On February 9, 2011, in a column, she described the national Log Cabin Republicans as \"ridiculous\" and \"not conservative at all\". She did however describe the Texas branch of Log Cabin Republicans, for whom she's been signing books for years, as \" real conservatives\".\n\nAt the 2011 CPAC, during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, \"The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side\", and \"Gays are natural conservatives\". Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that \"The gays have got to be pro-life\", and \"As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?\"\n\nCoulter initially supported George W. Bush's presidency, but later criticized its approach to immigration. She endorsed Duncan Hunter and later Mitt Romney in the 2008 Republican presidential primary and the 2012 Republican presidential primary and presidential run. In the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, she endorsed Donald Trump. She has since distanced herself from Trump since his election following arguments over immigration policies, calling for his impeachment on September 14, 2017 and saying \"Put a form in Trump, he's dead\". She now describes herself as a \"former Trumper\".\n\nOther candidates Coulter has endorsed include Greg Brannon, 2014 Republican primary candidate for North Carolinia Senator, Paul Nehlen, 2016 Republican primary candidate for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, Mo Brooks, 2017 Republican primary candidate for Alabama Senator, and Roy Moore, and 2017 Republican candidate for Alabama Senator.\n\nCoulter strongly supports continuing the War on Drugs. However, she has said that, if there were not a welfare state, she \"wouldn't care\" if drugs were legal. She spoke about drugs as a guest on \"Piers Morgan Live\", when she said that marijuana users \"can't perform daily functions\".\n\nCoulter is as an advocate of the white genocide conspiracy theory. She has compared non-white immigration into the United States with genocide, and claiming that \"a genocide\" is occurring against South African farmers, she has said that the Boers are the \"only real refugees\" in South Africa. Regarding domestic politics, \"Vox\" labelled Coulter as one of many providing a voice for \"the 'white genocide' myth\", and the SPLC covered Coulter's remarks that if the demographic changes occurring in the U.S. were being \"legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide\".\n\nAnn Coulter has described herself as a \"polemicist\" who likes to \"stir up the pot\" and does not \"pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do\". While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President Bill Clinton as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political pundit, sometimes creating controversy ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. \"Time\" magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter \"likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote\". This was in reference to her statement that \"it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except Goldwater in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.\" Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the \"New York Observer\", Coulter said:\nIn addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015). This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.\n\nCoulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for \"Human Events\", was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.\n\nCoulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a favorable settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.\n\nDavid Daley, who wrote the interview piece for \"The Hartford Courant\" recounted what followed:\n\nIn his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: \"We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President.\" After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:\n\nThe case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via summary judgment. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, \"... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment.\" The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.\n\nIn October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, \"I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund.\" Coulter publicly denounced Jones, calling her \"the trailer-park trash they said she was\" (Coulter had earlier chastened Clinton supporters for calling Jones this name), after Clinton's former campaign strategist James Carville had made the widely reported remark, \"Drag a $100 bill through a trailer park, and you'll never know what you'll find\", and called Jones a \"fraud, at least to the extent of pretending to be an honorable and moral person\".\n\nCoulter wrote:\n\nAs the 2008 presidential campaign was getting under way, Coulter drew criticism for statements she made at the 2007 Conservative Political Action Conference about presidential candidate John Edwards:\n\nThe comment was in reference to \"Grey's Anatomy\" star Isaiah Washington's use of the epithet and his subsequent mandatory \"psychological assessment\" imposed by ABC executives. It was widely interpreted as meaning that Coulter had called Edwards a \"faggot\", but Coulter argued that she did not actually do so, while simultaneously indicating she would not have been wrong to say it. Edwards responded on his web site by characterizing Coulter's words as \"un-American and indefensible\", and asking readers to help him \"raise $100,000 in 'Coulter Cash' this week to keep this campaign charging ahead and fight back against the politics of bigotry\". He also called her a \"she-devil\", adding, \"I should not have name-called. But the truth is—forget the names—people like Ann Coulter, they engage in hateful language.\" Coulter's words also drew condemnation from many prominent Republicans and Democrats, as well as groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Three advertisers (Verizon, Sallie Mae and Netbank) also pulled their advertisements from Coulter's web site, and several newspapers dropped her column. Coulter responded in an e-mail to the \"New York Times\", \"C'mon, it was a joke. I would never insult gays by suggesting that they are like John Edwards. That would be mean.\" On March 5, 2007, she appeared on \"Hannity and Colmes\" and said, \"Faggot isn't offensive to gays; it has nothing to do with gays. It's a schoolyard taunt meaning 'wuss.'\" Gay rights advocates were not convinced. \"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable,\" said Neil G. Giuliano, president of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, \"and the applause from her audience is an important reminder that Coulter's ugly brand of bigotry is at the root of the discriminatory policies being promoted at this gathering.\" A spokesman for Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments \"wildly inappropriate\".\n\nAs the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named Duncan Hunter as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his anti-abortion credentials, saying \"[t]his is a winning issue for us, protecting little babies\". On January 16, 2008, Coulter began endorsing Governor Mitt Romney as her choice for the 2008 Republican nomination, saying he is \"manifestly the best candidate\" (contrasting Romney with Republican candidates John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Rudy Giuliani). By contrast, Coulter was critical of eventual Republican nominee John McCain. On the January 31, 2008, broadcast of \"Hannity and Colmes\", Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for Hillary Clinton, stating, \"[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain.\"\n\nRegarding then-presidential-candidate Barack Obama in an April 2, 2008, column, she characterized his book \"Dreams from My Father\" as a \"dimestore \"Mein Kampf\". Coulter writes, \"He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially WASPs. We think everybody is inferior, and we are perfectly charming about it.\"\n\nIn March 2010, Coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three Canadian universities, The University of Western Ontario, the University of Ottawa and the University of Calgary. The tour was organized by the International Free Press Society.\n\nOn the eve of Coulter's first speech at the University of Western Ontario, an e-mail to Coulter from François Houle, provost of the University of Ottawa, was leaked to the media. The e-mail warned that \"promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges.\" Coulter released a public statement alleging that by sending her the e-mail, Houle was promoting hatred against conservatives. During her speech at the University of Western Ontario, she told a Muslim student to \"take a camel\", in response to the student's question about previous comments by Coulter that Muslims should not be allowed on airplanes.\n\nOn March 22, the University of Ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent Coulter from speaking. The event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence; Alain Boucher of the Ottawa Police Service said there were ten officers visible at the scene, \"plus other resources\" nearby. Boucher alleged that Coulter's security team decided to call off the event, saying, \"We gave her options,\" including, he said, to \"find a bigger venue.\" But \"they opted to cancel ... It's not up to the Ottawa police to make that decision.\" Boucher claimed there were no arrests. CTV News reported, \"It was a disaster in terms of just organization, which is probably one of the reasons why it was cancelled\", citing the small number of students tasked with confirming who had signed up to attend Coulter's talk.\n\nEvent organizer and conservative activist Ezra Levant blamed the protest on the letter sent to Coulter by Houle. After the cancellation, Coulter called the University of Ottawa \"bush league\", stating:\n\nOn September 14, 2001, three days after the September 11 attacks (in which her friend Barbara Olson had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:\nThis comment resulted in Coulter's being fired as a columnist by the \"National Review\", which she subsequently referred to as \"squeamish girly-boys\". Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations remarked in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" that before September 11, Coulter \"would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues\", but \"now it's accepted as legitimate commentary\".\n\nOne day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:\nCoulter was highly critical in 2002 of the U.S. Department of Transportation and especially its then-secretary Norman Mineta. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use racial profiling as a component of airport screening. After a group of Muslims was expelled from a US Airways flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the ejection from a flight of six imams, Coulter wrote:\nCoulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted \"any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'\" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England\". Coulter says the poll was \"by \"The Daily Telegraph\"\", actually it was by Sunrise, an \"Asian\" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because \"FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling\", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. \"The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?\"\n\nCoulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the civil rights lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most \"egregious discrimination\" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them. In an interview with \"The Guardian\" she said, \"I think airlines ought to start advertising: 'We have the most civil rights lawsuits brought against us by Arabs.'\" When the interviewer, Jonathan Freedland, replied by asking what Muslims would do for travel, she responded, \"They could use flying carpets.\"\n\nOne comment that drew criticism from the blogosphere, as well as fellow conservatives, was made during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2006, where she said, referring to the prospect of a nuclear-equipped Iran, \"What if they start having one of these bipolar episodes with nuclear weapons? I think our motto should be, post-9-11: Raghead talks tough, raghead faces consequences.\" Coulter had previously written a nearly identical passage in her syndicated column: \"I believe our motto should be, after 9/11: Jihad monkey talks tough; jihad monkey takes the consequences. Sorry, I realize that's offensive. How about 'camel jockey'? What? Now what'd I say? Boy, you tent merchants sure are touchy. Grow up, would you?\"\n\nIn October 2007, Coulter made further remarks about Arabs—this time, Iraqis—when she stated in an interview with \"The New York Observer\":\nIn a May 2007 article looking back at the life of then recently deceased evangelical Reverend Jerry Falwell, Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that \"the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen.\" In her article, Coulter stated that she disagreed with Falwell's statement, \"because Falwell neglected to specifically include Teddy Kennedy and 'the Reverend' Barry Lynn\".\n\nIn October 2007, Coulter participated in David Horowitz' \"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week\", remarking in a speech at the University of Southern California, \"The fact of Islamo-Fascism is indisputable. I find it tedious to detail the savagery of the enemy ... I want to kill them. Why don't Democrats?\"\n\nIn the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, Coulter told \"Hannity\" host Sean Hannity that the wife of bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev should be jailed for wearing a hijab. Coulter continued by saying \"Assimilating immigrants into our culture isn't really working. They're assimilating us into their culture.\"\n\nIn the wake of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in Paris, Coulter said France \"needs to move to the next step\" in dealing with terror. Coulter said of some immigrants:\n\nCoulter has attributed American gun violence in America to black and Muslim American men, stating that the epidemic of gun-related deaths is \"not a gun problem, it's a demographic problem.\"\n\nWhen asked about the financial crisis in the 2000s, Coulter claimed one reason for it was that \"they gave your mortgage to a less qualified minority\".\n\nOn March 16, 2011, discussing the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, Coulter, citing research into radiation hormesis, wrote that there was \"burgeoning evidence that excess radiation operates as a sort of cancer vaccine.\" Her comments were criticized by figures across the political spectrum, from Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (who told Coulter, \"You have to be responsible ... in something like this, you gotta get the folks out of there, and you have to report worst-case scenarios\") to MSNBC's Ed Schulz (who stated that \"You would laugh at her if she wasn't making light of a terrible tragedy.\").\n\nDuring the Republican Party presidential primaries, she supported Mitt Romney over former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. On an interview during \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on Fox News, she compared Newt Gingrich's attacks on the media to Jesse Jackson \"accusing people of racism\". On her website, she posted a column titled, \"Re-elect Obama: Vote Newt!\" arguing that if Newt Gingrich won the Republican nomination, Barack Obama would win re-election. When asked to respond about her criticism, Newt Gingrich dismissed them as \"the old order\" and cited recent polls showing him ahead of Mitt Romney.\n\nOn October 22, 2012, following a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account: \"I highly approve of Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard\", drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word which some find offensive to describe the president of the United States. The Special Olympics condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's. On \"The Alan Colmes Show\", Coulter stated that she does not regret her use of the word, saying, Retard' had been used colloquially to just mean 'loser' for 30 years. But no, these aggressive victims have to come out and tell you what words to use.\"\n\nAfter the election, in which Barack Obama won, Ann Coulter wrote a column titled \"Romney Was Not the Problem\". In it she argued against the idea that Mitt Romney lost because he failed to get his message across. She also said that Mitt Romney lost because he was running against an incumbent.\n\nIn March 2013, Coulter was one of the keynote speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where she made references to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's weight (\"CPAC had to cut back on its speakers this year about 300 pounds\") and progressive activist Sandra Fluke's hairdo. (Coulter quipped that Fluke didn't need birth control pills because \"that haircut is birth control enough\".) Coulter advocated against a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants because such new citizens would never vote for Republican candidates: \"If amnesty goes through, America becomes California and no Republican will ever win another election.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2015, Coulter appeared on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" and said that of all the declared Republican primary candidates, Donald Trump had the best chance of winning the general election, prompting the studio audience to laugh in disbelief. Coulter later endorsed Donald Trump in the general election, which he went on to win.\n\nCoulter has been a contributor to VDARE since 2006.\n\nVDARE is a right wing website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow. VDARE is considered controversial because of its alleged ties to white supremacist rhetoric and support of scientific racism and white nationalism.\n\nIn April 2017, \"The New York Times\" reported that the University of California, Berkeley had cancelled Ann Coulter's speech scheduled for April 27. A university spokesman said they had not discussed a specific date with her and only learned about it by reading news reports. The university administrators cited threats of violence and offered to accommodate her on a later date. Coulter said she saw no way forward, telling \"The New York Times\", \"It's a sad day for free speech.\" Both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren publicly called for the university to defend her right to free speech.\n\nCoulter was reportedly invited by UC Berkeley student organization Berkeley Patriot to participate in an event headed by Milo Yiannopoulos, scheduled for September 24–27. Coulter never promoted her participation and after the event was cancelled noted that her speakers bureau agency had never contracted for her to appear at the event.\n\nCoulter was accused of anti-semitism in an October 8, 2007, interview with Donny Deutsch on \"The Big Idea\". During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants \"Jews to be perfected, as they say\" (referring to them being converted to Christianity). Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment. Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Bradley Burston, and the National Jewish Democratic Council asked media outlets to cease inviting Coulter as a guest commentator. Talk show host Dennis Prager, while disagreeing with her comments, said that they were not \"anti-semitic\", noting, \"There is nothing in what Ann Coulter said to a Jewish interviewer on CNBC that indicates she hates Jews or wishes them ill, or does damage to the Jewish people or the Jewish state. And if none of those criteria is present, how can someone be labeled anti-Semitic?\" Conservative activist David Horowitz also defended Coulter against the allegation.\n\nCoulter in September 2015 tweeted in response to multiple Republican candidates' references to Israel during a Presidential debate, \"How many f—ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?\" The Anti-Defamation League referred to the tweets as \"ugly, spiteful and anti-Semitic\". In response to accusations of anti-Semitism, she tweeted \"I like the Jews, I like fetuses, I like Reagan. Didn't need to hear applause lines about them all night.\"\n\nIn October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\" by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal \"Human Events\" who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled \"A Case for Impeachment\".\n\nOn the July 5, 2006, episode of \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" on MSNBC, guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book \"Godless\" as well as in her columns over the previous year. Barrie ran \"Godless\" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. He points to a 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the \"Portland Press\" as some examples of evidence.\n\nMedia Matters for America has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter's work. The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges. Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.\nColumnist Bill Nemitz from the \"Portland Press Herald\" accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book \"Godless\", but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.\n\nSometimes referred to as an \"Internet queen\", Coulter has a high public profile.\n\nShe rejects \"the academic convention of euphemism and circumlocution\", and is claimed to play to misogyny in order to further her goals; she \"dominates without threatening (at least not straight men)\". Feminist critics also reject Coulter's opinion that the gains made by women have gone so far as to create an anti-male society and her call for women to be rejected from the military because they are more vicious than men. Like the anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, Coulter uses traditionally masculine rhetoric as reasoning for the need for traditional gender roles, and she carries this idea of feminized dependency into her governmental policies, according to feminist critics.\n\nCoulter's maternal line in the United States extends back to the American Revolutionary War and earlier, while her father's ancestors are Irish and German immigrants who arrived in the United States in the mid-19th century. She has two older brothers: James, an accountant, and John, an attorney. Coulter has been engaged several times, but she has never married and has no children. She has dated \"Spin\" founder and publisher Bob Guccione, Jr., and conservative writer Dinesh D'Souza. In October 2007, she began dating Andrew Stein, the former president of the New York City Council, a liberal Democrat. When asked about the relationship, Stein told the \"New York Post\", \"She's attacked a lot of my friends, but what can I say, opposites attract!\" On January 7, 2008, however, Stein told the \"New York Post\" that the relationship was over, citing irreconcilable differences. Kellyanne Conway, who refers to Coulter as a friend, told \"New York\" magazine in 2017 that Coulter \"started dating her security guard probably ten years ago because she couldn't see anybody else\".\n\nCoulter owns a house, bought in 2005, in Palm Beach, Florida, a condominium in Manhattan, and an apartment in Los Angeles. She votes in Palm Beach and is not registered to do so in New York or California. She is a fan of several jam bands, such as the Grateful Dead, the Dave Matthews Band, and Phish. Some of her favorite books include the Bible, \"Mere Christianity\", \"Wuthering Heights\", \"Anna Karenina\", true crime stories about serial killers, and anything by Dave Barry.\n\n\n\n"}

Appalled by the fact that although she had been a registered voter in Pennsylvania and Ohio she was unable to register to vote in Alabama, Cooper began to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. Her attempt to register to vote in 1963 resulted in her being fired from her job as a nurse at a rest home. She then worked as a clerk at the Torch Motel.\n\nIn January 1965, Cooper stood in line for hours outside the Dallas County Courthouse to register to vote until Sheriff Jim Clark ordered her to vacate the premises. Clark prodded Cooper in the neck with a billy club until Cooper turned around and hit the sheriff in the jaw, knocking him down. Deputies then wrestled Cooper to the ground as Clark continued to beat her repeatedly with his club. Cooper was charged with \"criminal provocation\" and was escorted to the county jail, and then held for 11 hours before being allowed to leave. She spent the period of her incarceration singing spirituals. Some in the sheriff's department wanted to charge her with attempted murder. Following this incident, Cooper became a registered voter in her home state.\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Annie Lee Cooper became a centenarian. Reflecting on her longevity, she stated, \"My mother lived to be 106, so maybe I can live that long, too.\" She died on November 24, 2010, at the Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma, Alabama.\n\nIn the 2014 film \"Selma\", Cooper was portrayed by Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey said that she took the role \"because of the magnificence of Annie Lee Cooper and what her courage meant to an entire movement.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "53917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53917", "title": "Archetype", "text": "Archetype\n\nThe concept of an archetype appears in areas relating to behavior, modern psychological theory, and literary analysis. An archetype can be:\n\n\nThe word \"archetype\", \"original pattern from which copies are made\", first entered into English usage in the 1540s and derives from the Latin noun \"archetypum\", latinisation of the Greek noun (\"archétypon\")\",\" whose adjective form is (\"archétypos\"), which means \"first-molded\", which is a compound of \"archḗ\", \"beginning, origin\", and \"týpos\", which can mean, amongst other things, \"pattern\", \"model\", or \"type\".\n\nUsage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism to their work.\nAccording to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture and/or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.\n\nThe origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as Plato. Plato's \"ideas\" were pure mental forms that were imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. They were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir Thomas Browne and Francis Bacon both employ the word 'archetype' in their writings; Browne in \"The Garden of Cyrus\" (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.\n\nThe concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, c. 1919. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a complex ( e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through evolution. At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.\nJung states in part one of \"Man And His Symbols\" that:My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype \"is a tendency to form such representations\" of a motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms \"primordial images,\" include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden. He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.\n\nOther authors have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:\n\n\n\nLater in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. Ernest Dichter took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Around 1939, he moved to New York and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a famous letter boasting his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.\n\nChristopher Booker, author of \"The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories\", argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:\nThese themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes.\n\nArchetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring images, symbols, or patterns (which may include motifs such as the \"quest\" or the \"heavenly ascent\"; recognizable character types such as the \"trickster\", \"saint\", \"martyr\" or the \"hero\"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.\n\nThe archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.\n\n"}
{"id": "303890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303890", "title": "Banking in Switzerland", "text": "Banking in Switzerland\n\nBanking in Switzerland began in the early 18th century through Switzerland's merchant trade and has, over the centuries, grown into a complex, regulated, and international industry. Along with the Swiss Alps, Swiss chocolate, watchmaking and mountaineering, banking is seen as emblematic of Switzerland. Switzerland has a long, kindred history of banking secrecy and client confidentiality reaching back to the early 1700s. Started as a way to protect wealthy European banking interests, Swiss banking secrecy was codified in 1934 with the passage of the landmark federal law, the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks. \n\nControversial protection of foreign accounts and assets during World War II sparked a series of proposed financial regulations seeking to temper bank secrecy to little success. Switzerland, considered the \"grandfather of bank secrecy\", has been one of the largest offshore financial centers and tax havens in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite an international push to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of proposed roll backs. Disclosing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offence since the early 1900s. Employees working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks \"have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that observed by doctors or priests\". Since 1934, banking secrecy laws have been violated by four people: Christoph Meili (1997), Bradley Birkenfeld (2007), Rudolf Elmer (2011), and Hervé Falciani (2014). After insurmountable professional setbacks, all the men were either fired or resigned from their banks, served with federal arrest warrants and fined.\n\nThe Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held US$6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets. Switzerland's main lingual hubs, Geneva (for French), Lugano (for Italian), and Zürich (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the Financial Secrecy Index and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The three largest banks–UBS, Credit Suisse, Julius Bär–are all regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), and the Swiss National Bank (NSB) which derives its authority from a series of federal statutes. Banking in Switzerland has historically played, and still continues to play, a dominant role in the Swiss economy and society. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product. Banking in Switzerland has been portrayed, to varying degrees of accuracy, in overall popular culture, books, movies, and television shows.\n\nDuring the 18th century, Swiss mercenaries brought home funds from their contracts that helped Swiss banks begin. Banking began in the eighteenth century by way of the riches of merchants. Wegelin & Co., established in 1741, was the oldest bank in Switzerland until it restructured into a new legal entity in 2013. \"Hy Hentsch & Co.\" bank and Lombard Odier, were both founded in 1796 in Geneva as private banks, and The Pictet Group was established in 1805 as a merchant bank. \"Hentsch & Cie\" was a founding member of the Swiss National bank during 1852.\n\nSwiss banks have served as safe havens for the wealth of dictators, despots, mobsters, arms dealers, corrupt officials, and tax cheats of all kinds.\n\nSwitzerland is a prosperous nation with a per capita gross domestic product higher than that of most Western European nations. The value of the Swiss franc (CHF) has been relatively stable compared with that of other currencies. Swiss neutrality and national sovereignty, long recognized by foreign nations, have fostered a stable environment for the banking sector to develop and thrive. Switzerland maintained neutrality through both World Wars, is not a member of the European Union, and did not join the United Nations until 2002. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), an organization that facilitates cooperation among the world's central banks, is headquartered in Basel. Founded in 1930, the BIS chose to locate in Switzerland because of the country's neutrality, which was important to the organization founded by countries that had been enemies in World War I.\n\nBanking has played a dominant role in the Swiss economy for two centuries. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), total banking assets amount to 467% of total gross domestic product.\n\nThe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is a public law institution that supervises most banking-related activities as well as securities markets and investment funds. Regulatory authority is derived from the Swiss Financial Market Supervision Act (FINMASA) and Article 98 of the Swiss Federal Constitution. The office of the Swiss Banking Ombudsman, founded in 1993, is sponsored by the Swiss Banking Ombudsman Foundation, which was established by the Swiss Bankers Association. The ombudsman's services, which are offered free of charge, include mediation and assistance to persons searching for dormant assets. The ombudsman handles about 1,500 complaints raised against banks yearly.\n\n Bank secrecy in the Swiss region can be traced to the Great Council of Geneva which outlawed the disclosure of information about the European upper class in 1713. As a way of avoiding the Protestant banking system, Catholic French Kings deposited their holdings in Geneva accounts. During the 1780s, Swiss bank accounts began insuring deposits which contributed to their reputation for financial security. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna formally established Switzerland's international neutrality which led to a large capital influx. The wealthy, landlocked Switzerland saw banking secrecy as a way to build an empire similar to that of France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Swiss historian Sébastian Guex notes in \"The Origins of Secret Swiss Bank Accounts\":This is what the Swiss bourgeoisie are thinking: 'That’s our future. We will play on the contradictions between the European powers and, protected by the shield of our neutrality, our arm will be industry and finance.’After a small scale civil war in the 1840s between the Swiss cantons, the Swiss Federation was founded in 1848. The formation of the state, through a direct democracy, contributed to the political stability needed for banking secrecy. The mountainous terrain of Switzerland provided a natural environment to excavate underground vaults for storage of gold and diamonds. During the 1910s, Swiss bankers traveled to France to advertise its banking secrecy during World War I. The war's contribution to political and economic instability, sparked a rapid capital movement into Switzerland. As European countries began to increase taxes to finance the war, wealthy clients moved their holdings into Swiss accounts to avoid taxation. The French banked in Geneva, the Italians in Lugano, and the Germans in Zurich. While disclosing client information was a civil offence in Switzerland for centuries, the Swiss Federal Assembly made it a federal criminal offence in 1934 with the passage of the landmark legislation, the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks. Colloquially known as the Banking Law of 1934 or the Swiss Banking Law of 1934, it codified banking secrecy. The Federal Assembly enacted the law to quell controversy over the alleged tax evasion of wealthy French businessmen, military generals, and Catholic bishops. An additional provision, Article 47(b), was drafted before its ratification to protect Jewish assets from the Nazi party.\n\nAlong with protecting German Jewish assets, Swiss banks collaborated with Nazi Germany and their allies by storing their gold and cash balances in underground vaults. Adolf Hitler maintained an account at the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) estimated at 1.1 billion Reichsmarks. After the United States formally asked the bank to transfer the money in the 1990s, UBS wired US$400 to 700 million worth of Reichsmarks to U.S. authorities. Banking regulations in Switzerland limit the amount of orphaned assets allowed to leave a bank's custody. UBS, with consent from the Swiss government, froze the account containing Hitler's assets indefinitely, and clipped the Reichsmarks, stripping the currency of value. During World War II, UBS also maintained accounts for hundreds of German Jewish businesspeople and households. After the Banking Law of 1934 was passed, the bank aggressively protected assets of the \"enemies of Nazi Germany\". When Hitler announced an (aborted) invasion of Switzerland in 1940, UBS contracted the Swiss Armed Forces to blockade their retail banks and transport Jewish assets to underground military bunkers. The Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) and Credit Suisse, did likewise but along with UBS, they were later fined hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations for their dealings with Nazi Germany. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, numerous international proposals for bank secrecy rollbacks were made by foreign states with little success.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, Switzerland signed the European Union Savings Tax Directive (EUSTD) which obliges Swiss banks to report to 43 European countries non-identifying annual tax statistics. On December 3, 2008, the Federal Assembly increased the prison sentence for violations of banking secrecy from a maximum of six months to five years. In late 2008, after an international, multi-state into Switzerland's role in U.S. tax evasion, the Swiss government entered into a limited, Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice. The agreement initiated the landmark Birkenfeld Disclosure of information on more than 4,000 clients.\nIn another step toward loosening banking secrecy, Switzerland signed the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), after rejecting it twice in parliament. The FATCA requires Swiss banks to disclose non-identifying U.S. client information annually to the Internal Revenue Service. The agreement does not guarantee the semi-automatic information transfers, which remain at the discretion of Swiss government authorities. If a client does not consent to having their information shared with the IRS, Swiss law prohibits the disclosure. If a client does consent, Swiss banks send the IRS tax-related information about the account holder but are prohibited from disclosing identities pursuant to Article 47 of the Banking Law of 1934. The 2018 Financial Secrecy Index stated: \"this [does] not mean that Swiss banking secrecy was finished, as some excitable news reports suggest… the breach was a partial [dent]\".\n\nIn March 2015, the Swiss government entered into bilateral \"Rubik Agreements\" with Germany, Austria, and the United Kingdom allowing foreign holders of Swiss bank accounts to retain their anonymity in exchange for paying predetermined back taxes. Switzerland adopted the International Convention on the Automatic Exchange of Banking Information (AEOI) in 2017, agreeing to automatically release limited financial information to certain countries for the sole purpose of tax auditing. This agreement includes the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) which obliges Swiss banks to automatically send foreign tax authorities the client's name, address, domicile, tax number, date of birth, account number, account balance at years end, and the gross investment income. The CRS does not, however, override the Swiss Banking Law of 1934, so the client's expenses (withdrawals) and investments are not disclosed. Thus tax authorities cannot \"go fishing\" for tax evaders, they must directly link a financial crime to the client's account. The disclosed information can \"only\" be used for tax auditing and Swiss authorities may prevent disclosure.\n\nIn December 2017, the Swiss parliament launched a standing initiative and expressed an interest in formally embedding banking secrecy within the Swiss Constitution making it a federally-protected constitutional right. In January, 2018, a U.S. district court ruled that Swiss bankers \"[have] nothing to do with the choice that an American taxpayer makes to not declare offshore assets\", later clarifying they should not be seen as facilitating tax evasion but rather provide a legal service that is made illegal by the client. The Swiss Justice Ministry announced in March 2018 that disclosure of client information in a pending court case involving a Swiss bank is subject to federal espionage and extortion charges in addition to charges relating to banking secrecy laws.\n\nSwitzerland, considered the \"grandfather of bank secrecy\", has been one of the largest offshore financial centers and tax havens in the world since the mid-20th century. Despite an international push to meaningfully roll back banking secrecy laws in the country, Swiss social and political forces have minimized and reverted much of the proposed roll backs. Disclosing client information has been considered a serious social and criminal offense since the early 1900s. Whistleblowers, despite legal protections, have been treated with hostility from the public and often face professional set backs in Switzerland. Swiss bankers who maintain offices \"exclusively\" in Switzerland are shielded from a foreign state's lawsuits, extradition requests, and criminal charges, as long as they remain \"within\" the country's legal jurisdiction. In spite of minor adjustments to bank secrecy, bankers working in Switzerland and abroad at Swiss banks \"have long adhered to an unwritten code similar to that observed by doctors or priests\". Switzerland's main lingual hubs, Geneva (for French), Lugano (for Italian), and Zürich (for German) service the different geographical markets. It consistently ranks in the top three states on the Financial Secrecy Index and was named first many times, most recently in 2018. The Swiss Bankers Association estimated in 2018 that Swiss banks held US$6.5 trillion in assets or 25% of all global cross-border assets.\n\nSecrecy laws have been violated by four people since 1934: Christoph Meili (1997), Bradley Birkenfeld (2007), Rudolf Elmer (2011), and Hervé Falciani (2014). In all four cases, the whistleblowers were served with federal arrest warrants, fined, and sustained professional setbacks in Switzerland.\n\nA handful of larger Swiss banks operate undisclosed or otherwise secretive bank vaults, storage facilities or underground bunkers for gold bars, diamonds, or other valuable physical assets. Most of these underground bunkers are located near or at the foothills of the mountainous regions of the Swiss Alps. These facilities are not subject to the same banking regulations as banks in Switzerland and do not have to report holdings to regulatory agencies. The Swiss defense department estimates that of the ten former military bunkers available for sale, six of them were sold to Swiss banks to house assets during the 1980s and 1990s. Storage in these underground bunkers and bank vaults is typically reserved for clients that pass a multi-stage security clearance. Some of these bunkers are not accessible by road or foot and require aircraft transportation.\n\nMany banks in Switzerland offer clients numbered bank accounts, accounts where the identity of the holder is replaced with a multi-digit number known only to the client and select private bankers. Although these accounts do add another layer of banking secrecy, they are not completely anonymous as the name of the client is still recorded by the bank and subject to limited, warranted disclosure. Some Swiss banks supplement the number with a code name such as \"Cardinal\", \"Octopussy\" or \"Cello\" that identifies the client, alternatively. However, to open this type of account in Switzerland, clients must pass a multi-stage clearance procedure and prove to the bank the lawful origins of their assets.\n\nMany sovereign states do not legally require private bankers to confirm whether or not a client has or has not paid their taxes, in any capacity. On top of this, Switzerland's banking secrecy laws prohibit the disclosure of client information under a variety of federal, cantonal, and civil policies. Many foreign nationals open Swiss bank accounts to take advantage of these laws and tax distinctions. While citizens of Switzerland retain the full force of banking secrecy protections, foreign clients are afforded some of the most stringent bank–client confidentiality protections in the world. In exchange for banking services, the Swiss government charges \"a low, lump-sum option on the money they bank\", after which Swiss tax authorities consider client tax burdens \"settled\". After the Banking Law of 1934 was passed, Swiss bankers traveled across Europe to advertise its banking secrecy during World War II. As European countries began to increase taxes to finance the war, wealthy clients moved their holdings into Swiss accounts to avoid taxation.\n\nAccording to the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index, Switzerland's banking secrecy laws have rendered it a premier tax haven since the 1900s. One of the most prominent attractions to the disclosure protection laws is the distinction between tax evasion (non-reporting of income) and tax fraud (active deception). Akin to the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion in the U.S., the non-reporting of income is only a civil offense in Switzerland while tax fraud is a financial crime. When foreign clients deposit holdings into a Swiss bank account, the bank is legally prohibited from disclosing balances or client information to tax authorities. This prohibition can only be waved if the client has produced a written statement of consent or a financial crime has been directly linked to the bank account. More often than not, clients don't consent to foreign tax authorities which leaves only the latter circumstance available. Many client services available in Switzerland (e.g. numbered bank accounts) are used to shield client data from tax authorities.\n\nBreaches of banking secrecy laws in Switzerland are automatically processed pursuant to Article 47 of the Banking Law of 1934: those who disclose client information are subject to a maximum of five years imprisonment and 250,000 francs (€215,000 or US$250,000) in fines. Whistleblowers and leakers of client information often face hostility from the public and sustain professional set backs. Denounced as a criminal in Switzerland, a federal arrest warrant has been in place for Bradley Birkenfeld since 2008, after he disclosed UBS client information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in 2007. After the 2008 financial crisis, the Swiss Parliament initiated a series of international tax treaties that rolled back banking secrecy protections for foreign clients in response to pressure from the European Union, United States, and United Kingdom. Despite implementing nearly 50 information transfer agreements and numerous limitations to banking secrecy protections for foreign clients, Switzerland has been ranked among the top three tax havens in the world every single year since the financial crisis, most recently in 2018. The majority of the overseas wealth in Switzerland originates in Germany, France and Saudi Arabia. \n\nAs of 2018, there are more than 400 securities dealers and banking instituons in Switzerland, ranging from the \"Two Big Banks\" down to small banks serving the needs of a single community or a few special clients. The largest and second largest Swiss banks are UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, respectively. They account for over 50% of all deposits in Switzerland; each has extensive branch networks throughout the country and most international centers. Due to their size and complexity, UBS and Credit Suisse are subject to an extra degree of supervision from the Federal Banking Commission.\n\nUBS Group AG came into existence in June 1998, when Union Bank of Switzerland, founded in 1862, and Swiss Bank Corporation, founded in 1872, merged. Headquartered in Zurich and Basel, it is Switzerland's largest bank. It maintains seven main offices around the world (four in the United States and one each in London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong) and branches on five continents.\n\nCredit Suisse Group is the second-largest Swiss bank. Based in Zurich and founded in 1856, Credit Suisse offers private banking, investment banking and asset management services. It acquired the First Boston Corporation in 1988 and merged with the Winterthur insurance company in 1997; the latter was sold to AXA in 2006. The asset management services were sold to Aberdeen Asset Management during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Swiss National Bank (SNB) serves as the country's central bank. Founded by the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank (16 January 1906), it began conducting business on 20 June 1907. Its shares are publicly traded, and are held by the cantons, cantonal banks, and individual investors; the federal government does not hold any shares. Although a central bank often has regulatory authority over the country's banking system, the SNB does not; regulation is solely the role of the Federal Banking Commission.\n\nRaiffeisen Banks \"assumes the role of central bank\" in providing treasury services, and is the third largest group consisting of 328 banks in 2011, 390 in 2012 with 1,155 branches. During February 2012, P. Vincenz was chief executive. During January, an announcement was made that the non-U.S. businesses of Wegelin & Co, the oldest Swiss bank, would be bought by the Raiffeisen group. The group has 3 million plus clients within Switzerland.\n\nThe term private bank refers to a bank that offers private banking services and in its legal form is a partnership. The first private banks were created in St. Gallen in the mid-18th century and in Geneva in the late 18th century as partnerships, and some are still in the hands of the original families such as Hottinger and Mirabaud. In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations. Historically in Switzerland a minimum of CHF1 million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry hurdles to CHF250,000 for private investors.\n\nThere are, as of 2006, 24 cantonal banks; these banks are state-guaranteed semi-governmental organizations controlled by one of Switzerland's 26 cantons that engage in all banking businesses. The largest cantonal bank, the Zurich Cantonal Bank, had a 2005 net income of CHF810 million.\n\nBanking in Switzerland, in particular Swiss banking secrecy practices, has been detailed in global popular culture to varying degrees of accuracy. According to official statements from the Swiss National Film Archives, inaccurate or exaggerated portrayals negatively impact Switzerland by reducing bankers to unflattering \"caricatures\" that are \"ever disposed to accept funds from questionable sources\". In 2014, Sindy Schmiegel, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) stressed that financial regulation in Switzerland is dramatically more strict than portrayed fictionally. \"The Economic Times\" noted that popular culture portrays Swiss bank accounts as \"completely anonymous\" later adding \"this is simply not true.\"\n\nSwiss banking was prominently featured in the following films and television shows:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "540801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540801", "title": "Behaviorism", "text": "Behaviorism\n\nBehaviorism (or behaviourism) is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that all behaviors are either reflexes produced by a response to certain stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli. Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of inheritance in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental factors.\nBehaviorism combines elements of philosophy, methodology, and psychological theory. It emerged in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to depth psychology and other traditional forms of psychology, which often had difficulty making predictions that could be tested experimentally. The earliest derivatives of Behaviorism can be traced back to the late 19th century where Edward Thorndike pioneered the law of effect, a process that involved strengthening behavior through the use of reinforcement.\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, John B. Watson devised methodological behaviorism, which rejected introspective methods and sought to understand behavior by only measuring observable behaviors and events. It was not until the 1930s that B. F. Skinner suggested that private events—including thoughts and feelings—should be subjected to the same controlling variables as observable behavior, which became the basis for his philosophy called \"radical behaviorism.\" While Watson and Ivan Pavlov investigated the stimulus-response procedures of classical conditioning, Skinner assessed the controlling nature of consequences and also its potential effect on the antecedents (or discriminative stimuli) that strengthens behavior; the technique became known as operant conditioning.\n\nSkinner's radical behaviorism has been highly successful experimentally, revealing new phenomena with new methods, but Skinner’s dismissal of theory limited its development. Theoretical behaviorism recognized that a historical system, an organism, has a state as well as sensitivity to stimuli and the ability to emit responses. Indeed, Skinner himself acknowledged the possibility of what he called “latent” responses in humans, even though he neglected to extend this idea to rats and pigeons. Latent responses constitute a repertoire, from which operant reinforcement can select. \n\nThe application of radical behaviorism—known as applied behavior analysis—is used in a variety of settings, including, for example, organizational behavior management, to the treatment of mental disorders, such as autism and substance abuse. In addition, while behaviorism and cognitive schools of psychological thought may not agree theoretically, they have complemented each other in cognitive-behavior therapies, which have demonstrated utility in treating certain pathologies, including simple phobias, PTSD, and mood disorders.\n\nThere is no universally agreed-upon classification, but some titles given to the various branches of behaviorism include:\n\nTwo subtypes are:\n\nB. F. Skinner proposed radical behaviorism as the conceptual underpinning of the experimental analysis of behavior. This view differs from other approaches to behavioral research in various ways but, most notably here, it contrasts with methodological behaviorism in accepting feelings, states of mind and introspection as behaviors subject to scientific investigation. Like methodological behaviorism it rejects the reflex as a model of all behavior, and it defends the science of behavior as complementary to but independent of physiology. Radical behaviorism overlaps considerably with other western philosophical positions such as American pragmatism.\n\nThis essentially philosophical position gained strength from the success of Skinner's early experimental work with rats and pigeons, summarized in his books \"The Behavior of Organisms\" and \"Schedules of Reinforcement\". Of particular importance was his concept of the operant response, of which the canonical example was the rat's lever-press. In contrast with the idea of a physiological or reflex response, an operant is a class of structurally distinct but functionally equivalent responses. For example, while a rat might press a lever with its left paw or its right paw or its tail, all of these responses operate on the world in the same way and have a common consequence. Operants are often thought of as species of responses, where the individuals differ but the class coheres in its function-shared consequences with operants and reproductive success with species. This is a clear distinction between Skinner's theory and S–R theory.\n\nSkinner's empirical work expanded on earlier research on trial-and-error learning by researchers such as Thorndike and Guthrie with both conceptual reformulations—Thorndike's notion of a stimulus–response \"association\" or \"connection\" was abandoned; and methodological ones—the use of the \"free operant\", so called because the animal was now permitted to respond at its own rate rather than in a series of trials determined by the experimenter procedures. With this method, Skinner carried out substantial experimental work on the effects of different schedules and rates of reinforcement on the rates of operant responses made by rats and pigeons. He achieved remarkable success in training animals to perform unexpected responses, to emit large numbers of responses, and to demonstrate many empirical regularities at the purely behavioral level. This lent some credibility to his conceptual analysis. It is largely his conceptual analysis that made his work much more rigorous than his peers', a point which can be seen clearly in his seminal work \"Are Theories of Learning Necessary?\" in which he criticizes what he viewed to be theoretical weaknesses then common in the study of psychology. An important descendant of the experimental analysis of behavior is the Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior.\n\nAs Skinner turned from experimental work to concentrate on the philosophical underpinnings of a science of behavior, his attention turned to human language with his 1957 book \"Verbal Behavior\" and other language-related publications; \"Verbal Behavior\" laid out a vocabulary and theory for functional analysis of verbal behavior, and was strongly criticized in a review by Noam Chomsky.\n\nSkinner did not respond in detail but claimed that Chomsky failed to understand his ideas, and the disagreements between the two and the theories involved have been further discussed. Innateness theory is opposed to behaviorist theory which claims that language is a set of habits that can be acquired by means of conditioning. According to some, the behaviorist account is a process which would be too slow to explain a phenomenon as complicated as language learning. What was important for a behaviorist's analysis of human behavior was not language acquisition so much as the interaction between language and overt behavior. In an essay republished in his 1969 book \"Contingencies of Reinforcement\", Skinner took the view that humans could construct linguistic stimuli that would then acquire control over their behavior in the same way that external stimuli could. The possibility of such \"instructional control\" over behavior meant that contingencies of reinforcement would not always produce the same effects on human behavior as they reliably do in other animals. The focus of a radical behaviorist analysis of human behavior therefore shifted to an attempt to understand the interaction between instructional control and contingency control, and also to understand the behavioral processes that determine what instructions are constructed and what control they acquire over behavior. Recently, a new line of behavioral research on language was started under the name of relational frame theory.\n\nBehaviourism focuses on one particular view of learning: a change in external behaviour achieved through using reinforcement and repetition (Rote learning) to shape behavior of learners. Skinner found that behaviors could be shaped when the use of reinforcement was implemented. Desired behavior is rewarded, while the undesired behavior is not rewarded. Incorporating behaviorism into the classroom allowed educators to assist their students in excelling both academically and personally. In the field of language learning, this type of teaching was called the audio-lingual method, characterised by the whole class using choral chanting of key phrases, dialogues and immediate correction.\n\nWithin the behaviourist view of learning, the \"teacher\" is the dominant person in the classroom and takes complete control, evaluation of learning comes from the teacher who decides what is right or wrong. The learner does not have any opportunity for evaluation or reflection within the learning process, they are simply told what is right or wrong.\nThe conceptualization of learning using this approach could be considered \"superficial\" as the focus is on external changes in behaviour i.e. not interested in the internal processes of learning leading to behaviour change and has no place for the emotions involved the process.\n\nOperant conditioning was developed by B.F. Skinner in 1937 and deals with the modification of \"voluntary behaviour\" or operant behaviour. Operant behavior operates on the environment and is maintained by its consequences. Reinforcement and punishment, the core tools of operant conditioning, are either positive (delivered following a response), or negative (withdrawn following a response). Skinner created the \"Skinner Box\" or operant conditioning chamber to test the effects of operant conditioning principles on rats. From this study, he discovered that the rats learned very effectively if they were rewarded frequently. Skinner also found that he could shape the rats' behavior through the use of rewards, which could, in turn, be applied to human learning as well.\n\nAlthough operant conditioning plays the largest role in discussions of behavioral mechanisms, classical conditioning (or Pavlovian conditioning or respondent conditioning) is also an important behavior-analytic process that need not refer to mental or other internal processes. Pavlov's experiments with dogs provide the most familiar example of the classical conditioning procedure. In simple conditioning, the dog was presented with a stimulus such as a light or a sound, and then food was placed in the dog's mouth. After a few repetitions of this sequence, the light or sound by itself caused the dog to salivate. Although Pavlov proposed some tentative physiological processes that might be involved in classical conditioning, these have not been confirmed. The idea of classical conditioning helped behaviorist John Watson discover the key mechanism behind how humans acquire the behaviors that they do, which was to find a natural reflex that produces the response being considered.\n\nWatson's \"Behaviourist Manifesto\" has three aspects that deserve special recognition: one is that psychology should be purely objective, with any interpretation of conscious experience being removed, thus leading to psychology as the \"science of behaviour\"; the second one is that the goals of psychology should be to predict and control behaviour (as opposed to describe and explain conscious mental states; the third one is that there is no notable distinction between human and non-human behaviour. Following Darwin's theory of evolution, this would simply mean that human behaviour is just a more complex version in respect to behaviour displayed by other species.\n\nBehaviorism is a psychological movement that can be contrasted with philosophy of mind. The basic premise of \"radical behaviorism\" is that the study of behavior should be a natural science, such as chemistry or physics, without any reference to hypothetical inner states of organisms as causes for their behavior. Less radical varieties are unconcerned with philosophical positions on internal, mental and subjective experience. Behaviorism takes a functional view of behavior. According to Edmund Fantino and colleagues: \"Behavior analysis has much to offer the study of phenomena normally dominated by cognitive and social psychologists. We hope that successful application of behavioral theory and methodology will not only shed light on central problems in judgment and choice but will also generate greater appreciation of the behavioral approach.\"\n\nBehaviorist sentiments are not uncommon within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a logical behaviorist position (e.g., the \"beetle in a box\" argument). In logical positivism (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel), the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W. V. O. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism, influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Quine's work in semantics differed substantially from the empiricist semantics of Carnap which he attempted to create an alternative to, couching his semantic theory in references to physical objects rather than sensations. Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book \"The Concept of Mind\". Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented \"category mistakes\", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist, though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will.\nSkinner's view of behavior is most often characterized as a \"molecular\" view of behavior; that is, behavior can be decomposed into atomistic parts or molecules. This view is inconsistent with Skinner's complete description of behavior as delineated in other works, including his 1981 article \"Selection by Consequences\". Skinner proposed that a complete account of behavior requires understanding of selection history at three levels: biology (the natural selection or phylogeny of the animal); behavior (the reinforcement history or ontogeny of the behavioral repertoire of the animal); and for some species, culture (the cultural practices of the social group to which the animal belongs). This whole organism then interacts with its environment. Molecular behaviorists use notions from melioration theory, negative power function discounting or additive versions of negative power function discounting.\n\nMolar behaviorists, such as Howard Rachlin, Richard Herrnstein, and William Baum, argue that behavior cannot be understood by focusing on events in the moment. That is, they argue that behavior is best understood as the ultimate product of an organism's history and that molecular behaviorists are committing a fallacy by inventing fictitious proximal causes for behavior. Molar behaviorists argue that standard molecular constructs, such as \"associative strength\", are better replaced by molar variables such as rate of reinforcement. Thus, a molar behaviorist would describe \"loving someone\" as a pattern of loving behavior over time; there is no isolated, proximal cause of loving behavior, only a history of behaviors (of which the current behavior might be an example) that can be summarized as \"love\".\n\nThe early term behavior modification has been obsolete since the 1990s as it currently refers to the brief revival of methodological behaviorism in the 1970s and early 1980s. Applied behavior analysis—the term that replaced behavior modification—has emerged into a thriving field.\n\nThe independent development of behaviour analysis outside the US also continues to develop, In terms of motivation, there remains strong interest in the variety of human motivational behaviour factors, e.g.. Some, may go as far as suggesting that the current rapid change in organisational behaviour could partly be attributed to some of these theories and the theories that are related to it.\n\nThe interests among behavior analysts today are wide-ranging, as a review of the 30 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) within ABAI indicates. Such interests include everything from developmental disabilities and autism, to cultural psychology, clinical psychology, verbal behavior, Organizational Behavior Management (OBM; behavior analytic I–O psychology). OBM has developed a particularly strong following within behavior analysis, as evidenced by the formation of the OBM Network and the influential \"Journal of Organizational Behavior Management\" (JOBM; recently rated the 3rd highest impact journal in applied psychology by ISI JOBM rating).\n\nApplications of behavioral technology, also known as applied behavior analysis or ABA, have been particularly well established in the area of developmental disabilities since the 1960s. Treatment of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders has grown especially rapidly since the mid-1990s. This demand for services encouraged the formation of a professional credentialing program administered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, Inc. (BACB) and accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies. As of early 2012, there are over 300 BACB approved course sequences offered by about 200 colleges and universities worldwide preparing students for this credential and approximately 11,000 BACB certificants, most working in the United States. The Association of Professional Behavior Analysts was formed in 2008 to meet the needs of these ABA professionals.\n\nModern behavior analysis has also witnessed a massive resurgence in research and applications related to language and cognition, with the development of relational frame theory (RFT; described as a \"Post-Skinnerian account of language and cognition\"). RFT also forms the empirical basis for the highly successful and data-driven acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). In fact, researchers and practitioners in RFT/ACT have become sufficiently prominent that they have formed their own specialized organization that is highly behaviorally oriented, known as the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS). \n\nSome of the current prominent behavior analytic journals include the \"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis\" (JABA), the \"Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior\" (JEAB) JEAB website, the \"Journal of Organizational Behavior Management\" (JOBM), \"Behavior and Social Issues\" (BSI), as well as \"the Psychological Record\". Currently, the US has 14 ABAI accredited MA and PhD programs for comprehensive study in behavior analysis.\n\nCultural analysis has always been at the philosophical core of radical behaviorism from the early days (as seen in Skinner's \"Walden Two\", \"Science & Human Behavior\", \"Beyond Freedom & Dignity\", and \"About Behaviorism\").\n\nDuring the 1980s, behavior analysts, most notably Sigrid Glenn, had a productive interchange with cultural anthropologist Marvin Harris (the most notable proponent of \"cultural materialism\") regarding interdisciplinary work. Very recently, behavior analysts have produced a set of basic exploratory experiments in an effort toward this end. Behaviorism is also frequently used in game development, although this application is controversial.\n\nWith the fast growth of big behavioral data and applications, behavior analysis is ubiquitous. Understanding behavior from the informatics and computing perspective becomes increasingly critical for in-depth understanding of what, why and how behaviors are formed, interact, evolve, change and affect business and decision. Behavior informatics and behavior computing deeply explore behavior intelligence and behavior insights from the informatics and computing perspectives.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, behaviorism was largely eclipsed as a result of the cognitive revolution. This shift was due to methodological behaviorism being highly criticized for not examining mental processes, and this led to the development of the cognitive therapy movement.\nIn the mid-20th century, three main influences arose that would inspire and shape cognitive psychology as a formal school of thought:\n\nIn the early years of cognitive psychology, behaviorist critics held that the empiricism it pursued was incompatible with the concept of internal mental states. Cognitive neuroscience, however, continues to gather evidence of direct correlations between physiological brain activity and putative mental states, endorsing the basis for cognitive psychology.\n\n"}

{"id": "18950050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950050", "title": "Black box", "text": "Black box\n\nIn science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is \"opaque\" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.\n\nTo analyse something modeled as an open system, with a typical \"black box approach\", only the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) \"box\". The usual representation of this \"black box system\" is a data flow diagram centered in the box.\n\nThe opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a white box (sometimes also known as a \"clear box\" or a \"glass box\").\n\nThe modern meaning of the term \"black box\" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic circuit theory the process of network synthesis from transfer functions, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as \"black boxes\" characterized by their response to signals applied to their ports, can be traced to Wilhelm Cauer who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941. Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis. Vitold Belevitch puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of two-port networks as black boxes to Franz Breisig in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.\n\nIn cybernetics, a full treatment was given by Ross Ashby in 1956. A black box was described by Norbert Wiener in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of system identification. He saw the first step in self-organization as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, as Mario Bunge, used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.\n\nThe \"black box\" is an abstraction representing a class of concrete open system which can be viewed solely in terms of its \"stimuli inputs\" and \"output reactions\":\nThe understanding of a \"black box\" is based on the \"explanatory principle\", the hypothesis of a causal relation between the \"input\" and the \"output\", and:\n\nAn observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a \"black box\" can be written in a table with the form:\nin which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the \"box’s\" various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from Ashby, examining a box that has fallen from a flying saucer might lead to this protocol:\n\nThus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the \"observation table\"); all that, and nothing more.\n\nIf the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an experiment (illustration), and hypotheses about cause and effect can be tested directly.\n\nWhen the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in control theory is called a feed forward architecture.\n\nThe \"modeling process\" is the construction of a predictive mathematical model, using existing historic data (observation table).\n\nA developed \"black box model\" is a validated model when \"black-box testing\" methods ensures that it is, based solely on observable elements.\n\nWith backtesting, inputs for past events (not used in the \"modeling effort\") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.\n\n\"Black box theories\" are things defined only in terms of their function. The term \"black box theory\" is applied to any field, philosophy and science or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the thing's black box state, related to its characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).\n\nSpecifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available data is held in an inner situation away from facile investigations. The \"black box\" element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.\n\nIn humanities disciplines such as philosophy of mind and behaviorism, one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand psychological factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of consumer behaviour.\n\nThe \"black box theory of consciousness\" states that the mind is fully understood once the inputs and outputs are well-defined.\n\n\n\"Black Box theory\" is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "188540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188540", "title": "Classical conditioning", "text": "Classical conditioning\n\nClassical conditioning (also known as Pavlovian or respondent conditioning) refers to a learning procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus. These basic facts, which require many qualifications (see below), were first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov through experiments with dogs. Together with operant conditioning, classical conditioning became the foundation of behaviorism, a school of psychology which was dominant in the mid-20th century and is still an important influence on the practice of psychological therapy and the study of animal behavior. Classical conditioning is a basic learning process, and its neural substrates are now beginning to be understood.\n\nClassical conditioning occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US). Usually, the conditioned stimulus is a neutral stimulus (e.g., the sound of a tuning fork), the unconditioned stimulus is biologically potent (e.g., the taste of food) and the unconditioned response (UR) to the unconditioned stimulus is an unlearned reflex response (e.g., salivation). After pairing is repeated the organism exhibits a conditioned response (CR) to the conditioned stimulus when the conditioned stimulus is presented alone. (A conditioned response may occur after only one pairing.) Thus, unlike the UR, the CR is acquired through experience, and it is also less permanent than the UR.\n\nUsually the conditioned response is similar to the unconditioned response, but sometimes it is quite different. For this and other reasons, most learning theorists suggest that the conditioned stimulus comes to signal or predict the unconditioned stimulus, and go on to analyze the consequences of this signal. Robert A. Rescorla provided a clear summary of this change in thinking, and its implications, in his 1988 article \"Pavlovian conditioning: It's not what you think it is\". Despite its widespread acceptance, Rescorla's thesis may not be defensible.\n\nClassical conditioning differs from \"operant\" or \"instrumental\" conditioning: in classical conditioning, behaviors are modified through the association of stimuli as described above, whereas in operant conditioning behaviors are modified by the effect they produce (i.e., reward or punishment).\n\nThe best-known and most thorough early work on classical conditioning was done by Ivan Pavlov, although Edwin Twitmyer published some related findings a year earlier. During his research on the physiology of digestion in dogs, Pavlov developed a procedure that enabled him to study the digestive processes of animals over long periods of time. He redirected the animal's digestive fluids outside the body, where they could be measured. Pavlov noticed that his dogs began to salivate in the presence of the technician who normally fed them, rather than simply salivating in the presence of food. Pavlov called the dogs' anticipatory salivation \"psychic secretion\". Putting these informal observations to an experimental test, Pavlov presented a stimulus (e.g. the sound of a metronome) and then gave the dog food; after a few repetitions, the dogs started to salivate in response to the stimulus. Pavlov concluded that if a particular stimulus in the dog's surroundings was present when the dog was given food then that stimulus could become associated with food and cause salivation on its own.\n\nIn Pavlov's experiments the unconditioned stimulus (US) was the dog food because its effects did not depend on previous experience. The metronome's sound is originally a neutral stimulus NS because it does not elicit salivation in the dogs. After conditioning, the metronome's sound becomes the conditioned stimulus (CS)\" or conditional stimulus; because its effects depend on its association with food. Likewise, the responses of the dog follow the same conditioned-versus-unconditioned arrangement. The conditioned response (CR) is the response to the conditioned stimulus, whereas the unconditioned response (UR)\"' corresponds to the unconditioned stimulus.\n\nPavlov reported many basic facts about conditioning; for example, he found that learning occurred most rapidly when the interval between the CS and the appearance of the US was relatively short.\n\nAs noted earlier, it is often thought that the conditioned response is a replica of the unconditioned response, but Pavlov noted that saliva produced by the CS differs in composition from that produced by the US. In fact, the CR may be any new response to the previously neutral CS that can be clearly linked to experience with the conditional relationship of CS and US. It was also thought that repeated pairings are necessary for conditioning to emerge, but many CRs can be learned with a single trial, especially in fear conditioning and taste aversion learning.\n\nLearning is fastest in forward conditioning. During forward conditioning, the onset of the CS precedes the onset of the US in order to signal that the US will follow. Two common forms of forward conditioning are delay and trace conditioning.\n\nDuring simultaneous conditioning, the CS and US are presented and terminated at the same time. For example: If a person hears a bell and has air puffed into their eye at the same time, and repeated pairings like this lead to the person blinking when they hear the bell despite the puff of air being absent, this demonstrates that simultaneous conditioning has occurred.\n\nSecond-order or higher-order conditioning follow a two-step procedure. First a neutral stimulus (\"CS1\") comes to signal a US through forward conditioning. Then a second neutral stimulus (\"CS2\") is paired with the first (CS1) and comes to yield its own conditioned response. For example: A bell might be paired with food until the bell elicits salivation. If a light is then paired with the bell, then the light may come to elicit salivation as well. The bell is the CS1 and the food is the US. The light becomes the CS2 once it is paired with the CS1.\n\nBackward conditioning occurs when a CS immediately follows a US. Unlike the usual conditioning procedure, in which the CS precedes the US, the conditioned response given to the CS tends to be inhibitory. This presumably happens because the CS serves as a signal that the US has ended, rather than as a signal that the US is about to appear. For example, a puff of air directed at a person's eye could be followed by the sound of a buzzer.\n\nIn temporal conditioning, a US is presented at regular intervals, for instance every 10 minutes. Conditioning is said to have occurred when the CR tends to occur shortly before each US. This suggests that animals have a biological clock that can serve as a CS. This method has also been used to study timing ability in animals (see Animal cognition).\n\nThe example below shows the temporal conditioning, as US such as food to a hungry mouse is simply delivered on a regular time schedule such as every thirty seconds. After sufficient exposure the mouse will begin to salivate just before the food delivery. This then makes it temporal conditioning as it would appear that the mouse is conditioned to the passage of time. (see Basic Principle of Learning).\nIn this procedure, the CS is paired with the US, but the US also occurs at other times. If this occurs, it is predicted that the US is likely to happen in the absence of the CS. In other words, the CS does not \"predict\" the US. In this case, conditioning fails and the CS does not come to elicit a CR. This finding – that \"prediction\" rather than CS-US pairing is the key to conditioning – greatly influenced subsequent conditioning research and theory.\n\nIn the extinction procedure, the CS is presented repeatedly in the absence of a US. This is done after a CS has been conditioned by one of the methods above. When this is done, the CR frequency eventually returns to pre-training levels. However, extinction does not completely eliminate the effects of the prior conditioning. This is demonstrated by spontaneous recovery – when there is a sudden appearance of the (CR) after extinction occurs – and other related phenomena (see \"Recovery from extinction\" below). These phenomena can be explained by postulating accumulation of inhibition when a weak stimulus is presented.\n\nDuring acquisition, the CS and US are paired as described above. The extent of conditioning may be tracked by test trials. In these test trials, the CS is presented alone and the CR is measured. A single CS-US pairing may suffice to yield a CR on a test, but usually a number of pairings are necessary and there is a gradual increase in the conditioned response to the CS. This repeated number of trials increase the strength and/or frequency of the CR gradually. The speed of conditioning depends on a number of factors, such as the nature and strength of both the CS and the US, previous experience and the animal's motivational state. The process slows down as it nears completion.\n\nIf the CS is presented without the US, and this process is repeated continuously, the CS will eventually stop eliciting a CR. This means that the CR has been \"extinguished\". This occurs due to a temporal sensitive relationship between the US and CS. The cessation or long temporal delay of CS-US pairing results in a learned decision to stop responding to a CS since there is a sufficient change in the rate at which the CS is being reinforced.\n\nExternal inhibition may be observed if a strong or unfamiliar stimulus is presented just before, or at the same time as, the CS. This causes a reduction in the conditioned response to the CS.\n\nSeveral procedures lead to the recovery of a CR that had been first conditioned and then extinguished. This illustrates that the extinction procedure does not completely eliminate the effect of conditioning. These procedures are the following:\n\n\"Stimulus generalization\" is said to occur if, after a particular CS has come to elicit a CR, another similar stimulus will elicit the same CR. Usually the more similar the CS and the test stimulus are, the stronger the CR to the test stimulus. The more the test stimulus differs from the CS, the weaker the CR will be, or the more it will differ from that previously observed.\n\nOne observes \"stimulus discrimination\" when one stimulus (\"CS1\") elicits one CR and another stimulus (\"CS2\") elicits either another CR or no CR at all. This can be brought about by, for example, pairing CS1 with an effective US and presenting CS2 with no US.\n\nLatent inhibition refers to the observation that it takes longer for a familiar stimulus to become a CS than it does for a novel stimulus to become a CS, when the stimulus is subsequently paired with an effective US.\n\nThis is one of the most common ways to measure the strength of learning in classical conditioning. A typical example of this procedure is as follows: a rat first learns to press a lever through operant conditioning. Then, in a series of trials, the rat is exposed to a CS, a light or a noise, followed by the US, a mild electric shock. An association between the CS and US develops, and the rat slows or stops its lever pressing when the CS comes on. The rate of pressing during the CS measures the strength of classical conditioning; that is, the slower the rat presses, the stronger the association of the CS and the US. (Slow pressing indicates a \"fear\" conditioned response, and it is an example of a conditioned emotional response; see section below.)\n\nTypically, three phases of conditioning are used.\n\nA CS (CS+) is paired with a US until asymptotic CR levels are reached.\n\nCS+/US trials are continued, but these are interspersed with trials on which the CS+ is paired with a second CS, (the CS-) but not with the US (i.e. CS+/CS- trials). Typically, organisms show CRs on CS+/US trials, but stop responding on CS+/CS− trials.\n\n\nThis form of classical conditioning involves two phases.\n\nA CS (CS1) is paired with a US.\n\nA compound CS (CS1+CS2) is paired with a US.\n\nA separate test for each CS (CS1 and CS2) is performed. The blocking effect is observed in a lack of conditional response to CS2, suggesting that the first phase of training blocked the acquisition of the second CS.\n\nExperiments on theoretical issues in conditioning have mostly been done on vertebrates, especially rats and pigeons. However, conditioning has also been studied in invertebrates, and very important data on the neural basis of conditioning has come from experiments on the sea slug, \"Aplysia\". Most relevant experiments have used the classical conditioning procedure, although instrumental (operant) conditioning experiments have also been used, and the strength of classical conditioning is often measured through its operant effects, as in \"conditioned suppression\" (see Phenomena section above) and autoshaping.\n\nAccording to Pavlov, conditioning does not involve the acquisition of any new behavior, but rather the tendency to respond in old ways to new stimuli. Thus, he theorized that the CS merely substitutes for the US in evoking the reflex response. This explanation is called the stimulus-substitution theory of conditioning. A critical problem with the stimulus-substitution theory is that the CR and UR are not always the same. Pavlov himself observed that a dog's saliva produced as a CR differed in composition from that produced as a UR. The CR is sometimes even the opposite of the UR. For example: the unconditional response to electric shock is an increase in heart rate, whereas a CS that has been paired with the electric shock elicits a decrease in heart rate. (However, it has been proposed that only when the UR does not involve the central nervous system are the CR and the UR opposites.)\n\nThe Rescorla–Wagner (R–W) model is a relatively simple yet powerful model of conditioning. The model predicts a number of important phenomena, but it also fails in important ways, thus leading to a number of modifications and alternative models. However, because much of the theoretical research on conditioning in the past 40 years has been instigated by this model or reactions to it, the R–W model deserves a brief description here.\n\nThe Rescorla-Wagner model argues that there is a limit to the amount of conditioning that can occur in the pairing of two stimuli. One determinant of this limit is the nature of the US. For example: pairing a bell with a juicy steak is more likely to produce salivation than pairing the bell with a piece of dry bread, and dry bread is likely to work better than a piece of cardboard. A key idea behind the R–W model is that a CS signals or predicts the US. One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US. However, after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. (Note that the model can be described mathematically and that words like predict, surprise, and expect are only used to help explain the model.) Here the workings of the model are illustrated with brief accounts of acquisition, extinction, and blocking. The model also predicts a number of other phenomena, see main article on the model.\n\nformula_1\n\nThis is the Rescorla-Wagner equation. It specifies the amount of learning that will occur on a single pairing of a conditioning stimulus (CS) with an unconditioned stimulus (US). The above equation is solved repeatedly to predict the course of learning over many such trials.\n\nIn this model the degree of learning is measured by how well the CS predicts the US, which is given by the \"associative strength\" of the CS. In the equation, V represents the current associative strength of the CS, and ∆V is the change in this strength that happens on a given trial. ΣV is the sum of the strengths of all stimuli present in the situation. λ is the maximum associative strength that a given US will support; its value is usually set to 1 on trials when the US is present, and 0 when the US is absent. α and β are constants related to the salience of the CS and the speed of learning for a given US. How the equation predicts various experimental results is explained in following sections. For further details, see the main article on the model.\n\nThe R–W model measures conditioning by assigning an \"associative strength\" to the CS and other local stimuli. Before a CS is conditioned it has an associative strength of zero. Pairing the CS and the US causes a gradual increase in the associative strength of the CS. This increase is determined by the nature of the US (e.g. its intensity). The amount of learning that happens during any single CS-US pairing depends on the difference between the total associative strengths of CS and other stimuli present in the situation (ΣV in the equation), and a maximum set by the US (λ in the equation). On the first pairing of the CS and US, this difference is large and the associative strength of the CS takes a big step up. As CS-US pairings accumulate, the US becomes more predictable, and the increase in associative strength on each trial becomes smaller and smaller. Finally the difference between the associative strength of the CS (plus any that may accrue to other stimuli) and the maximum strength reaches zero. That is, the US is fully predicted, the associative strength of the CS stops growing, and conditioning is complete.\n\nThe associative process described by the R–W model also accounts for extinction (see \"procedures\" above). The extinction procedure starts with a positive associative strength of the CS, which means that the CS predicts that the US will occur. On an extinction trial the US fails to occur after the CS. As a result of this “surprising” outcome, the associative strength of the CS takes a step down. Extinction is complete when the strength of the CS reaches zero; no US is predicted, and no US occurs. However, if that same CS is presented without the US but accompanied by a well-established conditioned inhibitor (CI), that is, a stimulus that predicts the absence of a US (in R-W terms, a stimulus with a negative associate strength) then R-W predicts that the CS will not undergo extinction (its V will not decrease in size).\n\nThe most important and novel contribution of the R–W model is its assumption that the conditioning of a CS depends not just on that CS alone, and its relationship to the US, but also on all other stimuli present in the conditioning situation. In particular, the model states that the US is predicted by the sum of the associative strengths of all stimuli present in the conditioning situation. Learning is controlled by the difference between this total associative strength and the strength supported by the US. When this sum of strengths reaches a maximum set by the US, conditioning ends as just described.\n\nThe R–W explanation of the blocking phenomenon illustrates one consequence of the assumption just stated. In blocking (see \"phenomena\" above), CS1 is paired with a US until conditioning is complete. Then on additional conditioning trials a second stimulus (CS2) appears together with CS1, and both are followed by the US. Finally CS2 is tested and shown to produce no response because learning about CS2 was “blocked” by the initial learning about CS1. The R–W model explains this by saying that after the initial conditioning, CS1 fully predicts the US. Since there is no difference between what is predicted and what happens, no new learning happens on the additional trials with CS1+CS2, hence CS2 later yields no response.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the importance of the R–W model is that it is relatively simple and makes clear predictions. Tests of these predictions have led to a number of important new findings and a considerably increased understanding of conditioning. Some new information has supported the theory, but much has not, and it is generally agreed that the theory is, at best, too simple. However, no single model seems to account for all the phenomena that experiments have produced. Following are brief summaries of some related theoretical issues.\n\nThe R–W model reduces conditioning to the association of a CS and US, and measures this with a single number, the associative strength of the CS. A number of experimental findings indicate that more is learned than this. Among these are two phenomena described earlier in this article\n\nLatent inhibition might happen because a subject stops focusing on a CS that is seen frequently before it is paired with a US. In fact, changes in attention to the CS are at the heart of two prominent theories that try to cope with experimental results that give the R–W model difficulty. In one of these, proposed by Nicholas Mackintosh, the speed of conditioning depends on the amount of attention devoted to the CS, and this amount of attention depends in turn on how well the CS predicts the US. Pearce and Hall proposed a related model based on a different attentional principle Both models have been extensively tested, and neither explains all the experimental results. Consequently, various authors have attempted hybrid models that combine the two attentional processes. Pearce and Hall in 2010 integrated their attentional ideas and even suggested the possibility of incorporating the Rescorla-Wagner equation into an integrated model.\n\nAs stated earlier, a key idea in conditioning is that the CS signals or predicts the US (see \"zero contingency procedure\" above). However, for example, the room in which conditioning takes place also \"predicts\" that the US may occur. Still, the room predicts with much less certainty than does the experimental CS itself, because the room is also there between experimental trials, when the US is absent. The role of such context is illustrated by the fact that the dogs in Pavlov's experiment would sometimes start salivating as they approached the experimental apparatus, before they saw or heard any CS. Such so-called \"context\" stimuli are always present, and their influence helps to account for some otherwise puzzling experimental findings. The associative strength of context stimuli can be entered into the Rescorla-Wagner equation, and they play an important role in the \"comparator\" and \"computational\" theories outlined below.\n\nTo find out what has been learned, we must somehow measure behavior (\"performance\") in a test situation. However, as students know all too well, performance in a test situation is not always a good measure of what has been learned. As for conditioning, there is evidence that subjects in a blocking experiment do learn something about the \"blocked\" CS, but fail to show this learning because of the way that they are usually tested.\n\n\"Comparator\" theories of conditioning are \"performance based\", that is, they stress what is going on at the time of the test. In particular, they look at all the stimuli that are present during testing and at how the associations acquired by these stimuli may interact. To oversimplify somewhat, comparator theories assume that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, these associations are compared, and a response to the CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. After a CS and US are repeatedly paired in simple acquisition, the CS-US association is strong and the context-US association is relatively weak. This means that the CS elicits a strong CR. In “zero contingency” (see above), the conditioned response is weak or absent because the context-US association is about as strong as the CS-US association. Blocking and other more subtle phenomena can also be explained by comparator theories, though, again, they cannot explain everything.\n\nAn organism's need to predict future events is central to modern theories of conditioning. Most theories use associations between stimuli to take care of these predictions. For example: In the R–W model, the associative strength of a CS tells us how strongly that CS predicts a US. A different approach to prediction is suggested by models such as that proposed by Gallistel & Gibbon (2000, 2002). Here the response is not determined by associative strengths. Instead, the organism records the times of onset and offset of CSs and USs and uses these to calculate the probability that the US will follow the CS. A number of experiments have shown that humans and animals can learn to time events (see Animal cognition), and the Gallistel & Gibbon model yields very good quantitative fits to a variety of experimental data. However, recent studies have suggested that duration-based models cannot account for some empirical findings as well as associative models.\n\nThe Rescorla-Wagner model treats a stimulus as a single entity, and it represents the associative strength of a stimulus with one number, with no record of how that number was reached. As noted above, this makes it hard for the model to account for a number of experimental results. More flexibility is provided by assuming that a stimulus is internally represented by a collection of elements, each of which may change from one associative state to another. For example, the similarity of one stimulus to another may be represented by saying that the two stimuli share elements in common. These shared elements help to account for stimulus generalization and other phenomena that may depend upon generalization. Also, different elements within the same set may have different associations, and their activations and associations may change at different times and at different rates. This allows element-based models to handle some otherwise inexplicable results.\n\nA prominent example of the element approach is the “SOP” model of Wagner. The model has been elaborated in various ways since its introduction, and it can now account in principle for a very wide variety of experimental findings. The model represents any given stimulus with a large collection of elements. The time of presentation of various stimuli, the state of their elements, and the interactions between the elements, all determine the course of associative processes and the behaviors observed during conditioning experiments.\n\nThe SOP account of simple conditioning exemplifies some essentials of the SOP model. To begin with, the model assumes that the CS and US are each represented by a large group of elements. Each of these stimulus elements can be in one of three states: \nOf the elements that represent a single stimulus at a given moment, some may be in state A1, some in state A2, and some in state I.\n\nWhen a stimulus first appears, some of its elements jump from inactivity I to primary activity A1. From the A1 state they gradually decay to A2, and finally back to I. Element activity can only change in this way; in particular, elements in A2 cannot go directly back to A1. If the elements of both the CS and the US are in the A1 state at the same time, an association is learned between the two stimuli. This means that if, at a later time, the CS is presented ahead of the US, and some CS elements enter A1, these elements will activate some US elements. However, US elements activated indirectly in this way only get boosted to the A2 state. (This can be thought of the CS arousing a memory of the US, which will not be as strong as the real thing.) With repeated CS-US trials, more and more elements are associated, and more and more US elements go to A2 when the CS comes on. This gradually leaves fewer and fewer US elements that can enter A1 when the US itself appears. In consequence, learning slows down and approaches a limit. One might say that the US is “fully predicted” or “not surprising” because almost all of its elements can only enter A2 when the CS comes on, leaving few to form new associations.\n\nThe model can explain the findings that are accounted for by the Rescorla-Wagner model and a number of additional findings as well. For example, unlike most other models, SOP takes time into account. The rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the CS comes just before the US, and that when the CS comes after the US (“backward conditioning”) the result is often an inhibitory CS. Many other more subtle phenomena are explained as well.\nA number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate element representations. These often include the assumption that associations involve a network of connections between “nodes” that represent stimuli, responses, and perhaps one or more “hidden” layers of intermediate interconnections. Such models make contact with a current explosion of research on neural networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nPavlov proposed that conditioning involved a connection between brain centers for conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. His physiological account of conditioning has been abandoned, but classical conditioning continues to be to study the neural structures and functions that underlie learning and memory. Forms of classical conditioning that are used for this purpose include, among others, fear conditioning, eyeblink conditioning, and the foot contraction conditioning of \"Hermissenda crassicornis\", a sea-slug. Both fear and eyeblink conditioning involve a neutral stimulus, frequently a tone, becoming paired with an unconditioned stimulus. In the case of eyeblink conditioning, the US is an air-puff, while in fear conditioning the US is threatening or aversive such as a foot shock.\n\n\"Available data demonstrate that discrete regions of the cerebellum and associated brainstem areas contain neurons that alter their activity during conditioning – these regions are critical for the acquisition and performance of this simple learning task. It appears that other regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to the conditioning process, especially when the demands of the task get more complex.\"\n\nFear and eyeblink conditioning involve generally non overlapping neural circuitry, but share molecular mechanisms. \nFear conditioning occurs in the basolateral amygdala, which receives glutaminergic input directly from thalamic afferents, as well as indirectly from prefrontal projections. The direct projections are sufficient for delay conditioning, but in the case of trace conditioning, where the CS needs to be internally represented despite a lack of external stimulus, indirect pathways are necessary. The anterior cingulate is one candidate for intermediate trace conditioning, but the hippocampus may also play a major role. Presynaptic activation of protein kinase A and postsynaptic activation of NMDA receptors and its signal transduction pathway are necessary for conditioning related plasticity. CREB is also necessary for conditioning related plasticity, and it may induce downstream synthesis of proteins necessary for this to occur. As NMDA receptors are only activated after an increase in presynaptic calcium(thereby releasing the Mg2+ block), they are a potential coincidence detector that could mediate spike timing dependent plasticity. STDP constrains LTP to situations where the CS predicts the US, and LTD to the reverse.\n\nSome therapies associated with classical conditioning are aversion therapy, systematic desensitization and flooding.\nAversion therapy is a type of behavior therapy designed to make patients cease an undesirable habit by associating the habit with a strong unpleasant unconditioned stimulus. For example, a medication might be used to associate the taste of alcohol with stomach upset. Systematic desensitization is a treatment for phobias in which the patient is trained to relax while being exposed to progressively more anxiety-provoking stimuli (e.g. angry words). This is an example of counterconditioning, intended to associate the feared stimuli with a response (relaxation) that is incompatible with anxiety Flooding is a form of desensitization that attempts to eliminate phobias and anxieties by repeated exposure to highly distressing stimuli until the lack of reinforcement of the anxiety response causes its extinction. \"Flooding\" usually involves actual exposure to the stimuli, whereas the term \"implosion\" refers to imagined exposure, but the two terms are sometimes used synonymously.\n\nConditioning therapies usually take less time than humanistic therapies.\n\nA stimulus that is present when a drug is administered or consumed may eventually evoke a conditioned physiological response that mimics the effect of the drug. This is sometimes the case with caffeine; habitual coffee drinkers may find that the smell of coffee gives them a feeling of alertness. In other cases, the conditioned response is a compensatory reaction that tends to offset the effects of the drug. For example, if a drug causes the body to become less sensitive to pain, the compensatory conditioned reaction may be one that makes the user more sensitive to pain. This compensatory reaction may contribute to drug tolerance. If so, a drug user may increase the amount of drug consumed in order to feel its effects, and end up taking very large amounts of the drug. In this case a dangerous overdose reaction may occur if the CS happens to be absent, so that the conditioned compensatory effect fails to occur. For example, if the drug has always been administered in the same room, the stimuli provided by that room may produce a conditioned compensatory effect; then an overdose reaction may happen if the drug is administered in a different location where the conditioned stimuli are absent.\n\nSignals that consistently precede food intake can become conditioned stimuli for a set of bodily responses that prepares the body for food and digestion. These reflexive responses include the secretion of digestive juices into the stomach and the secretion of certain hormones into the blood stream, and they induce a state of hunger. An example of conditioned hunger is the \"appetizer effect.\" Any signal that consistently precedes a meal, such as a clock indicating that it is time for dinner, can cause people to feel hungrier than before the signal. The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is involved in the initiation of eating. The nigrostriatal pathway, which includes the substantia nigra, the lateral hypothalamus, and the basal ganglia have been shown to be involved in hunger motivation.\n\nThe influence of classical conditioning can be seen in emotional responses such as phobia, disgust, nausea, anger, and sexual arousal. A familiar example is conditioned nausea, in which the CS is the sight or smell of a particular food that in the past has resulted in an unconditioned stomach upset. Similarly, when the CS is the sight of a dog and the US is the pain of being bitten, the result may be a conditioned fear of dogs. An example of conditioned emotional response is conditioned suppression.\n\nAs an adaptive mechanism, emotional conditioning helps shield an individual from harm or prepare it for important biological events such as sexual activity. Thus, a stimulus that has occurred before sexual interaction comes to cause sexual arousal, which prepares the individual for sexual contact. For example, sexual arousal has been conditioned in human subjects by pairing a stimulus like a picture of a jar of pennies with views of an erotic film clip. Similar experiments involving blue gourami fish and domesticated quail have shown that such conditioning can increase the number of offspring. These results suggest that conditioning techniques might help to increase fertility rates in infertile individuals and endangered species.\n\nPavlovian-instrumental transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when a conditioned stimulus (CS, also known as a \"cue\") that has been associated with rewarding or aversive stimuli via classical conditioning alters motivational salience and operant behavior. In a typical experiment, a rat is presented with sound-food pairings (classical conditioning). Separately, the rat learns to press a lever to get food (operant conditioning). Test sessions now show that the rat presses the lever faster in the presence of the sound than in silence, although the sound has never been associated with lever pressing.\n\nPavlovian-instrumental transfer is suggested to play a role in the differential outcomes effect, a procedure which enhances operant discrimination by pairing stimuli with specific outcomes.\n\nIn the 1932 novel \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, conditioning plays a key role in the maintenance of social peace, especially in maintaining the caste system upon which society is based. Another example is in Anthony Burgess' 1962 dystopian novel \"A Clockwork Orange\" in which the novel's anti-hero and protagonist, Alex, undergoes a procedure called the Ludovico technique, where he is fed a solution to cause severe nausea and then forced to watch violent acts. This renders him unable to perform any violent acts without inducing similar nausea. Unintentionally, he also forms an aversion to classical music.\n\nSome general examples that involve the classical conditioning theory in action include, in a lot of cases, advertising. This is a tactic used in order to elicit a response. Advertising on game shows is one of many examples. With the exciting and positive environment of a game show, the viewer may then start to generate an exciting response to the advertisement because of the association with the environment. Another example, very similar to Pavlov's experiment, involves food. Every time a person goes into the kitchen, they begin to feel hungry. This can also relate to eating certain foods while watching a scary movie turning into associating terror with the food that was being consumed at the times of watching the movie. Any type of music, such as Christmas music, that triggers certain sweet memories are related to classical conditioning as well.\n\n\n"}

In the international context, it was part of the European wars of religion. The Count's Feud takes its name from the Protestant Count Christopher of Oldenburg, who supported the Catholic King Christian II, deposed in 1523, over the election of Christian III, a staunch Protestant who had already implemented Lutheranism as the state religion in Schleswig and Holstein in 1528.\n\nAfter Frederick I's death in 1533, the Jutland nobility proclaimed his son, then Duke Christian of Gottorp, as King under the name Christian III. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by Lübeck and troops from Oldenburg and Mecklenburg, parts of the Zealand and Skåne nobilities rose up, together with cities such as Copenhagen and Malmø. The violence itself began in 1534, when a privateer captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called Skipper Clement, at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of Vendsyssel and North Jutland to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in Aalborg. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted Skåne for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as regent on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in Ringsted.\n\nAn army of nobles under the leadership of Niels Brock and Holger Rosenkrantz was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with Lübeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels. Under the leadership of Johan Rantzau, the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications.\n\nOn 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell. At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days. For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in Storvorde east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau. Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in Viborg and executed in 1536.\n\nFortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the Swedish front. The Swedish King Gustav Vasa sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded Skåne at Loshult and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the area as it advanced toward the town of Væ. Later, a Swedish army invaded Halland, which was destroyed by fire and sword. Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but Tyge Krabbe in Helsingborg Castle supported Count Christoffer. In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg. An army consisting of residents of Lübeck and Malmø under Jørgen Kock was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes. With that, Denmark east of the Sound was lost for Count Christoffer.\n\nAfter the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the Battle of Øksnebjerg, where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated. Both Copenhagen and Malmø, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege. With this, the Count's Feud was officially over.\n\nIn the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in Skåne at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, Claus Bille (of Stockholm Bloodbath fame, second cousin to Gustav Vasa), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to Otte Brahe, and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Skåne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malmø, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism.\n\nIn contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly. Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles. Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident. Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes.\n\nAn important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Skåne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish King to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the King the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.\n\n\nThe science fiction novel \"The Corridors of Time\" by Poul Anderson — an American of Danish origin, whose work often includes themes from Danish and Scandinavian history — includes a vivid description of Jutland in the immediate aftermath of the Count's Feud and the continuing struggle by hunted diehard rebels, as seen by a time-traveller from the 20th century.\n\nMuch of the information in this section is translated from the corresponding Danish Wikipedia entry.\n"}

The identity is something that is not set in stone, but rather it is something that is constantly re-purposing itself and changing. According to the skeptical post-modern theories, the self cannot be based off a foundation of mere experiences because a constant flow of information is streaming through the mind and changing the very way people identify with themselves and their environment. To remedy this, post-structuralist theorists expanded on this because of the infinite way significance can be perceived by way of knowledge in language. The relationship between words and what they symbolize is constantly evolving which creates the notion that identity and the self is \"a product and effect of competing, fragmentary and contradictory discourses.\" This leads to the comparison of the self to a crystal. Crystals are multidimensional much like identity. No matter the condition, crystals are still able to exist in different states, sizes, and colors. The more the crystal endures throughout its existence, the more complex and unique it becomes. Identity, on the other hand, becomes more complex and unique by way of discourse and language-base, thus leading to the metaphor known as the \"crystallized self\".\n\nAn alternative metaphor is the “crystallized self,” a notion that pulls from Laurel Richardson’s (2001) epistemological notion of \"crystallization\". The “crystallized self” is considered a positive term that helps people to experience and talk about the self in more appropriately politicized and layered ways. Tracy and Tretheway say:\n“The crystallized self is neither real nor fake…. The crystallized self is multidimensional; the more facets, the more beautiful and complex. Certainly crystals may feel solid, stable, and fixed. But just as crystals have differing forms, depending upon whether they grow rapidly or slowly, under constant or fluctuating conditions, or from highly variable or remarkably uniform fluids or gasses, crystallized selves have different shapes depending on the various discourses through which they are constructed and constrained”.\nViewing the self as crystallized moves away from ideas of which parts of the self are more “authentic” and rather suggests that the self is constructed through context and communication. Multiple facets can be “real” and competing simultaneously.\n\nTo better realize a crystallized self, individuals might consider the following:\n\n\n\n"}

XVIII.26), 'patience' (Srimad Bhagavatam Sl. V.v.10-13), 'firmness' (\"Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya\" Sl. XXIV.11), and refers to 'perseverance' (Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya Sl. XXIV.174), 'wearing regularly' (\"Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya\" XXIV.333) and to one of the eleven \"Rudranis\" (Srimad Bhagavatam Sl.III.xii.13). There is no correct equivalent English word for \"Dhrti\" which is derived from \"dhr-\" meaning 'to bear'. \"Dhrti\" meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles.\n\n\"Dhrti\" is the name of a Vedic metre of the type 12.12.8|12.8|12.8., and is a variety of the \"Atichandas\". It is also the name of a yoga in Hindu Calendar. The Vedic Rishis address their prayers to the Visvedevas just as they do the Adityas and the Maruts; who all as a group are the protectors of the ten Rtas including \"Dhrti\" ('forebearance') which word represents an abstract idea like \"Hri\" and \"Kirti\".\n\nAs part of the performance of the \"Ashvamedha yajna\", as mentioned in the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\", \"Asvalayana-srauta-sutra\" and \"Sankhayana-srauta-sutra\", the \"Adhvaryu\" offered, for the safe movement of the Sacrificial Horse during day-time, three \"Istis\" daily to \"Savitr\" and at nightfall performed four \"Dhrti Homas\" for the safe sheltering of that horse during night-time. While the \"Dhrti Homas\" were in progress, a \"Rajanya\" (\"Kshatriya\") lute-player (\"veenagathi\") sang three songs (\"Gatha\") made up of many verses in which he praised the royal-sacrificer with the mention of his heroic exploits, viz., the wars he waged, the battles he won, the conquests he made, so on.\n\nThe Purana Index lists \"Dhrti\", borne by \"Vijaya\", as one of the sons of \"Dharma\" who was the son of Brahma, and who married all thirteen daughters of \"Daksha\", each of whom bore \"Dhrti\" a son. \"Dhrtavarta\" was the son of \"Dhrti\" and father of \"Satyakarma\". \"Nandi\" was a consort of \"Dhrti\". \"Niyama\" was a son of \"Dhrti\". And, \"Dhrti\" ('courage') is invoked in the \"Grahabalis\".\n\nIn the \"Stuti\" of \"Devi Bhagavatam\" (V.22.25-42), \"Devi\", who is the Energy for the creation and destruction of the universe, has been praised as having many names and as residing in all in the form of \"shakti\" ('power and energy'), \"amrti\" ('memory'), \"dhrti\" ('steadfastness'), \"buddhi \" ('intelligence'), so on. According to the Puranas, \"Brahma\" is the creator, \"Mukunda\" (\"Vishnu \") is the preserver and \"Hara\" (\"Rudra) is the destroyer but they themselves are created by Devi at the beginning of a yuga, therefore, she is the mother of all.\n\n\"Dhrti\" meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles. With regard to the three types of \"Dhrtis\" mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita, Swami Tejomayananda states that \"Sattvic dhrti\" is the unswerving fortitude with which one works for a noble cause with enthusiasm and dedication, despite obstacles; \"Rajasic dhrti\" is the fortitude displayed for a while, in a part, place or under particular circumstances to achieve particular goals and may dissolve under different circumstances and situations, and \"Tamasic dhrti\" is the stubbornness with which one holds on to the false.\n\nThe two factors that supply the fuel and the motive force in all sustained endeavours are - \"buddhi\" ('understanding') and \"dhrti\" ('fortitude'), the former is 'the intellectual capacity to grasp what is happening' and the latter is 'the constancy of purpose and self-application'. Abhinavagupta states that since everyone works therefore, everyone possesses \"dhrti\"; he holds \"buddhi\" to mean 'resolution' and \"dhrti\" to mean 'satisfaction'.\n\nIn Hinduism, four things viz. Śruti and Smriti which are society’s codes of ethics, \"sadacara\" which is good noble conduct accepted by society; and \"svasya ca priyam atmanah\" which is one’s own joy and pleasure, determine Dharma. The \"sanatana dharma\" is the eternal universal values to be followed by all people in life, and \"varnasrama dharma\" consists of specific duties given to each individual; Dharma means that holds everyone and everything together which leads to material prosperity and spiritual realization in this life itself. According to Manu, \"Dhrti\" is one of the ten values necessary for all people at all times that characterize Dharma. \"Dhrti\" means fortitude; it means the capacity to hold on to something. It is the \"sattavic dhrti\" which is strength, force and ability that makes us hold on to noble values of life.\n\n\"Sattavic dhrti\" and \"Sattvic buddhi\" are mutually related terms. Krishna explains to Arjuna (Bhagavad Gita Sl. XVIII.30):\n\nthat \"That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that 'understanding' is \"sattvic\" ('pure').\" Which means the function of the intellect is discrimination, the faculty of 'right understanding ' (\"buddhi\") which gives real joy, success and prosperity. With regard to sattvic dhrti he states (Bhagavad Gita l. XVIII.33):\n\nthat the unwavering 'fortitude' by which through Yoga the functions of the mind, the Prana and the senses are restrained, that 'fortitude', is \"sattvic\" ('pure').\nIn this context Sankara in his Bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita explains that 'action' (way of works) is movement leading to bondage and 'inaction' (renunciation) leads to liberation. The remote expression – unwavering or unfaltering or unbroken concentration, should be related to resolve or \"dhrti\"; the sense is that the functions of the mind and so forth, maintained through unfaltering resolve, are in fact maintained through concentration. \n\nPatanjali’s Yoga Sutra II.28 reads:-\n\nThis means – as impurities are eliminated through the observance of the steps of yoga, a gradual kindling of knowledge occurs up to the full illumination of discriminatory wisdom. Discriminatory wisdom as virtue is the cause of happiness, and both, Vyasa and Vijnanabhikshu in their commentaries list nine causes including as the ninth cause \"Dhrti\" here meaning sustenance; and agree that the \"yoga-angas\" eradicate the impurity in both tangible (\"drshta\") and intangible (\"adrshta\") ways i.e. the physical practices such as purification (\"shaucha\"), and through \"japa\". Elimination means disappearance of the veil on the \"sattva mind-field\". The body is the sustainer of the senses being their resort but the senses sustain the body by way of providing spiritual and material welfare. The gross elements are the sustainers of the body and also sustain each other; the diverse sub-human, human and celestial bodies are mutually the sustainers and the sustained. \"Dhrti\" also means patience, remaining true to duty even in calamities, and perfection in maintaining wisdom.\n\nVerse II.vi.145 of \"Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu\" states – the steadiness of heart arising from attaining realization of the Lord, from absence of suffering in attaining the realization of the Lord, and from realizing \"prema\" with the Lord is called \"dhrti\"; in this state there is no lamentation for things not attained or for things that have disappeared. \"Ksama\" ('tolerance') is included in \"dhrti-bhava\". The three types of \"rati\" ('relationship of love', 'attraction') are \"priti\" ('affection'), \" sakhya\" ('friendship') and \"vatsalya\", \"dhrti\" along with \"vitarka\" ('conjecture'), \" mati\" ('scriptural conclusion'), \"nirveda\" ('self-disgust'), \"smrti \" ('remembrance'), \"harsa\" ('joy'), and the type of \"bodha\" arising from destruction of ignorance become somewhat causes of \"rati\".\n"}

Or slightly different from this, the disjoint union of a family of subsets is the usual union of the subsets which are pairwise disjoint – disjoint sets means they have no element in common.\n\nNote that these two concepts are different but strongly related. Moreover, it seems that they are essentially identical to each other in category theory. That is, both are realizations of the coproduct of category of sets. \n\nConsider the sets formula_1 and formula_2. We can index the set elements according to set origin by forming the associated sets\nwhere the second element in each pair matches the subscript of the origin set (e.g., the formula_4 in formula_5 matches the subscript in formula_6, etc.). The disjoint union formula_7 can then be calculated as follows:\n\nFormally, let {\"A\" : \"i\" ∈ \"I\"} be a family of sets indexed by \"I\". The disjoint union of this family is the set\nThe elements of the disjoint union are ordered pairs (\"x\", \"i\"). Here \"i\" serves as an auxiliary index that indicates which \"A\" the element \"x\" came from. \n\nEach of the sets \"A\" is canonically isomorphic to the set\nThrough this isomorphism, one may consider that \"A\" is canonically embedded in the disjoint union.\nFor \"i\" ≠ \"j\", the sets \"A\"* and \"A\"* are disjoint even if the sets \"A\" and \"A\" are not. \n\nIn the extreme case where each of the \"A\" is equal to some fixed set \"A\" for each \"i\" ∈ \"I\", the disjoint union is the Cartesian product of \"A\" and \"I\":\n\nOne may occasionally see the notation\nfor the disjoint union of a family of sets, or the notation \"A\" + \"B\" for the disjoint union of two sets. This notation is meant to be suggestive of the fact that the cardinality of the disjoint union is the sum of the cardinalities of the terms in the family. Compare this to the notation for the Cartesian product of a family of sets. \n\nDisjoint unions are also sometimes written formula_13 or formula_14.\n\nIn the language of category theory, the disjoint union is the coproduct in the category of sets. It therefore satisfies the associated universal property. This also means that the disjoint union is the categorical dual of the Cartesian product construction. See coproduct for more details.\n\nFor many purposes, the particular choice of auxiliary index is unimportant, and in a simplifying abuse of notation, the indexed family can be treated simply as a collection of sets. In this case formula_15 is referred to as a \"copy\" of formula_16 and the notation formula_17 is sometimes used.\n\nIn category theory the disjoint union is defined as a coproduct in the category of sets. \n\nAs such, the disjoint union is defined up to an isomorphism, and the above definition is just one realization of the coproduct, among others. When the sets are pairwise disjoint, the usual union is another realization of the coproduct. This justifies the second definition in the lead.\n\nThis categorical aspect of the disjoint union explains why formula_18 is frequently used, instead of formula_19, to denote \"coproduct\".\n\n\n"}

The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to accrual method) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash income items. Another doctrine often used when trying to determine the timing of the inclusion of income is the constructive receipt doctrine.\n\nMost individuals begin as cash method taxpayers because their first form of bookkeeping is a checkbook. In contrast, some businesses start as accrual method taxpayers because businesses use different rules for recording income and expenditures. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 446(a) states, however, that \"[t]axable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books.\"\n\nOne of the major advantages to the cash method of accounting is the ability to defer taxation because the recognition of income applicable to amounts in accounts receivable can be deferred to a later year. The Doctrine of Cash Equivalence is important because many people are cash method taxpayers and would be subject to this rule.\n\nCash method taxpayers include income items (cash and cash equivalents) in the year the items are received. See also Treasury Regulations Certain payment transactions involve cash equivalents, such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really not much more than a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered cash equivalents, then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit established the standard for applying the cash equivalence doctrine to promises of payment. The court first noted that the principle that \"[a] promissory note, negotiable in form, is not necessarily the equivalent of cash\" remains true. But that principle also has a true inverse—that a non-negotiable instrument can be a cash equivalent if the following factors are met. A promise to pay will be considered a cash equivalent for cash method taxpayers if:\n\n\nSince taxpayers generally prefer to defer recognition of income to subsequent tax years (due to the time value of money), a finding of cash equivalence will typically be to the disadvantage of the individual taxpayer.\n\nTo use the doctrine of cash equivalence, a taxpayer must have either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed cash equivalent, then the taxpayer has income. If it is not cash equivalent, the taxpayer does not have income.\n"}
{"id": "316966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316966", "title": "Ecological modernization", "text": "Ecological modernization\n\nEcological modernization is a school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the economy benefits from moves towards environmentalism. It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and environmental discourse (Hajer, 1995).\n\nEcological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them Joseph Huber, and . Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Amory Lovins, Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker. Further substantial contributions were made by Arthur P.J. Mol, Gert Spaargaren and David A Sonnenfeld (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).\n\nOne basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of enlightened self-interest, economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental productivity, i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as labour productivity and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable supply chain management, clean technologies, benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the industrial metabolism. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s carrying capacity, ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.\n\nThere are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientiations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of multi-level governance combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general modernization theory as well as non-Marxist world-system theory, others don’t.\n\nUltimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).\n\nEcological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are\n\nA special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was \"sustainable household\", i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). \nSome scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in industrial symbiosis, i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). \nEcological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing (Braungart and McDonough, 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. \nAnother special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of social movements and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001).\n\nAs a strategy of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by business interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge free market principles. This contrasts with many environmental movement perspectives, which regard free trade and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of environmental degradation. Under ecological modernization, the state is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for markets that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see regulation) medium through which corporations are forced to 'take back' their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that car corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with Ulrich Beck (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of environmental governance, sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the environmental movement, community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic human rights of expression, organization, and assembly, etc. New media such as the Internet greatly facilitate this.\n\nCritics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect the environment and does nothing to alter the impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see capitalism) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of 'green-washing'. Critics question whether technological advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better environmental protection, particularly if left to business self-regulation practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most environmentally friendly product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. hydrogen or biofuel vs. peak oil). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross injustices that are produced within the capitalist system, such as environmental racism - where people of color and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as parks, and social justice issues such as eliminating unemployment (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - environmental racism is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett & Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - Germany and the Netherlands, and having little to say about the developing world (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of 'sustainable growth', and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to ecosystems and societies.\n\nEcological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.\n\n"}

The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in Parliament sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.\n\nWhen in 1829 the Roman Catholics of the United Kingdom were freed from all their civil disabilities, the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when William Huskisson presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of Liverpool. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by Robert Grant on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British legislature in one form or another for the next thirty years. Thomas Macaulay, later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.\n\nAt first the bill failed to get through the House of Commons. Against the opposition of Sir Robert Inglis, the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the Lords. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the Duke of Wellington speaking and voting against the Bill, though the Duke of Sussex, a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of Westminster. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King William IV was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable to make the annual appeal to Parliament, as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field; but by the passing of the Sheriffs' Declaration Act on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff. In the following year the Jew Bill was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli, who was born Jewish and baptised aged 12 into the Church of England, was a member of parliament from 1837, served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 Conservative governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.\n\nFor a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and Lord Holland in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the Religious Opinions Relief Act removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the Established Church; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.\n\nThe success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.\n\nA Jewish candidate, Lionel de Rothschild, was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the City of London in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.\n\nDavid Salomons, who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for Greenwich and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The Prime minister, Lord John Russell, moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected Lord Mayor of London.\n\nIn the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the \"Jews Relief Act 1858\" by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words \"on the true faith of a Christian.\"\n\nAs a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting \"so help me, Jehovah\" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859. Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.\n\nThe Reform Act 1867 granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of Numa Edward Hartog, the Universities Tests Act removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made Earl of Beaconsfield. They were followed within a few years by Henry de Worms as Lord Pirbright and Sydney Stern as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the British Empire were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of Lord High Chancellor and of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\n\nFor some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir George Jessel acted as solicitor-general in William Ewart Gladstone's first ministry. But from the time of the Conservative reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of Benjamin Disraeli may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under Secretary of State in one of Lord Salisbury's ministries, while Sir Julian Goldsmid, a Liberal Unionist after the Home Rule policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nAltogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse.\n\nThe pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the emancipation struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the Goldsmid family, which had been touched by the Mendelssohnian movement. In 1841 a Reform congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the Spanish haham and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the Jewish Board of Guardians. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the United Synagogue (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the Chief Rabbi autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the British empire. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the Irish Church, did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate haham, and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the Anglo-Jewish Association was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the Alliance Israélite, which had been weakened by the Franco-German war. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.\n\nAs early as 1840, when the blood accusation was revived with regard to the Damascus affair, and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the Board of Deputies at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the Mansion House, London (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. Sir Moses Montefiore, after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the Sultan at Constantinople, a firman repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the Mortara affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to Morocco on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate Hebrews of the Danubian principalities. Francis Goldsmid made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of Serbia (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in Romania. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.\n\nWhen in 1881 the outburst of violence in Russia brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in \"The Times\" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian refugees from Brody was organised by the committee of the Mansion House Fund. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the Guildhall, and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the Russo-Jewish committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When Maurice de Hirsch formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The immigrants being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.\n\n\"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While the Continent had seen the rise of strong anti-Semitic feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the \"Semitic\" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the \"alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the East End of London, of Eastern European Jews, had brought smallpox and scarlet fever. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. \" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "470843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=470843", "title": "Fight-or-flight response", "text": "Fight-or-flight response\n\nThe fight-or-flight response (also called hyperarousal, or the acute stress response) is a physiological reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat to survival. It was first described by Walter Bradford Cannon. His theory states that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the animal for fighting or fleeing. More specifically, the adrenal medulla produces a hormonal cascade that results in the secretion of catecholamines, especially norepinephrine and epinephrine. The hormones estrogen, testosterone, and cortisol, as well as the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, also affect how organisms react to stress.\n\nThis response is recognised as the first stage of the general adaptation syndrome that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.\n\nThe autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response and its role is mediated by two different components: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system originates in the spinal cord and its main function is to activate the physiological changes that occur during the fight-or-flight response. This component of the autonomic nervous system utilises and activates the release of norepinephrine in the reaction.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral spinal cord and medulla, physically surrounding the sympathetic origin, and works in concert with the sympathetic nervous system. Its main function is to activate the \"rest and digest\" response and return the body to homeostasis after the fight or flight response. This system utilises and activates the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.\n\nThe reaction begins in the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH. The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously, via the sympathetic nervous system, and releases the hormone epinephrine. The release of chemical messengers results in the production of the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system. The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose. Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response. Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or noradrenaline (norepinephrine), facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action and:\n\nThe physiological changes that occur during the fight or flight response are activated in order to give the body increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running. Some of the specific physiological changes and their functions include:\n\nIn the context of the fight or flight response, emotional regulation is used proactively to avoid threats of stress or to control the level of emotional arousal.\n\nDuring the reaction, the intensity of emotion that is brought on by the stimulus will also determine the nature and intensity of the behavioral response. Individuals with higher levels of emotional reactivity may be prone to anxiety and aggression, which illustrates the implications of appropriate emotional reaction in the fight or flight response.\n\nThe specific components of cognitions in the fight or flight response seem to be largely negative. These negative cognitions may be characterised by: attention to negative stimuli, the perception of ambiguous situations as negative, and the recurrence of recalling negative words. There also may be specific negative thoughts associated with emotions commonly seen in the reaction.\n\nPerceived control relates to an individual's thoughts about control over situations and events. Perceived control should be differentiated from actual control because an individual's beliefs about their abilities may not reflect their actual abilities. Therefore, overestimation or underestimation of perceived control can lead to anxiety and aggression.\n\nThe social information processing model proposes a variety of factors that determine behavior in the context of social situations and preexisting thoughts. The attribution of hostility, especially in ambiguous situations, seems to be one of the most important cognitive factors associated with the fight or flight response because of its implications towards aggression.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology explanation is that early animals had to react to threatening stimuli quickly and did not have time to psychologically and physically prepare themselves. The fight or flight response provided them with the mechanisms to rapidly respond to threats against survival.\n\nA typical example of the stress response is a grazing zebra. If the zebra sees a lion closing in for the kill, the stress response is activated as a means to escape its predator. The escape requires intense muscular effort, supported by all of the body’s systems. The sympathetic nervous system’s activation provides for these needs. A similar example involving fight is of a cat about to be attacked by a dog. The cat shows accelerated heartbeat, piloerection (hair standing on end), and pupil dilation, all signs of sympathetic arousal. Note that the zebra and cat still maintain homeostasis in all states.\n\nAnimals respond to threats in many complex ways. Rats, for instance, try to escape when threatened, but will fight when cornered. Some animals stand perfectly still so that predators will not see them. Many animals freeze or play dead when touched in the hope that the predator will lose interest.\n\nOther animals have alternative self-protection methods. Some species of cold-blooded animals change color swiftly, to camouflage themselves. These responses are triggered by the sympathetic nervous system, but, in order to fit the model of fight or flight, the idea of flight must be broadened to include escaping capture either in a physical or sensory way. Thus, flight can be disappearing to another location or just disappearing in place. And often both fight and flight are combined in a given situation.\n\nThe fight or flight actions also have polarity – the individual can either fight or flee against something that is threatening, such as a hungry lion, or fight for or fly towards something that is needed, such as the safety of the shore from a raging river.\n\nA threat from another animal does not always result in immediate fight or flight. There may be a period of heightened awareness, during which each animal interprets behavioral signals from the other. Signs such as paling, piloerection, immobility, sounds, and body language communicate the status and intentions of each animal. There may be a sort of negotiation, after which fight or flight may ensue, but which might also result in playing, mating, or nothing at all. An example of this is kittens playing: each kitten shows the signs of sympathetic arousal, but they never inflict real damage.\n\n"}

{"id": "4033017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4033017", "title": "Genogram", "text": "Genogram\n\nA genogram (also known as a McGoldrick–Gerson study, a Lapidus schematic or a family diagram) is a pictorial display of a person's family relationships and medical history. It goes beyond a traditional family tree by allowing the user to visualize hereditary patterns and psychological factors that punctuate relationships. It can be used to identify repetitive patterns of behavior and to recognize hereditary tendencies.\n\nMurray Bowen invented the concept of the genogram as part of his family systems model in the 1970s. Genograms were later developed and popularized in clinical settings by Monica McGoldrick and Randy Gerson through the publication of a book titled \"Genograms: Assessment and Intervention\" in 1985. Genograms are now used by various groups of people in a variety of fields such as medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work, genetic research, education, and many more. Some practitioners in personal and family therapy use genograms for personal records and/or to explain family dynamics to the client. Few if any genealogists use them.\n\nA genogram is created with simple symbols representing the gender, with various lines to illustrate family relationships. Some genogram users also put circles around members who live in the same living spaces. Genograms can be prepared by using a complex word processor, or a computer drawing program. There are also computer programs that are custom designed for genograms.\n\nGenogram symbols will usually have the date of birth (and date of death if applicable) above, and the name of the individual underneath. The inside of the symbol will hold the person's current age or various codes for genetic diseases or user-defined properties: abortions, still-births, SIDS, cohabitations, etc.\n\nA genogram can contain a wealth of information on the families represented. It will not only show the names of people who belong to a family lineage, but how these relatives relate to each other. For example, a genogram will not only show that a person called Paul and his wife Lily have three children, but that their eldest child was sent to boarding school; that their middle child is always in conflict with her mother; that their youngest has juvenile diabetes; that Paul suffered from depression, was an alcoholic, and a philosopher; and that Lily has not spoken to her brother for years, has breast cancer, and has a history of quitting her jobs.\n\nOne of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as family relationships, emotional relationships and social relationships. Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc.\n\nGenograms may also include emotional relationships. These provide an in-depth analysis of how individuals relate to one another. Colour-coded lines represent various emotional relationships that bond individuals together.<br>\nAnother component of genograms is social relationships. These allow users to link individuals who are not related to one another, but who have a connection in society-at-large, such as neighbor, co-worker, boss-employee, pastor-church member, teacher-student, etc. Social relationships can also illustrate an individual's relation to a social entity. The use of social relationships links allows the genogram to be used in a business environment to create organizational charts or floor plan layouts of the employees.\n\nA genogram looks like a family tree, but with all the different types of relationships, it contains a significantly more detailed and complete picture of the family or group it illustrates.\n\nIn genealogy, genograms are used to record family history through the lives of each of its members. Genograms allow the genealogist to graphically portray complex family trees that show marriages and divorces, reconstituted families, adoptions, strained relationships, family cohesion, etc. Genealogists can use genograms to discover and analyze interesting facts about their family history, such as a naming pattern, sibling rivalry, or significant events like immigration.\n\nIn medicine, medical genograms provide a quick and useful context in which to evaluate an individual's health risks. Knowledge of diseases and conditions that occur within a family can give a health care team invaluable information that may aid in a swift, accurate diagnosis and treatment of health problems. And, a knowledge of diseases and illnesses that \"run\" in families can give individuals an important head start in pursuing effective preventive measures. A medical genogram is helpful in determining patterns of disease or illness within a family. Medical genograms can include many generations, however four generations may prove to be enough detail.\n\nGenograms are used by sociologists to gather objective and consistent information from the clients and their family, helping them to view the client's issues in the larger context of their marital relationship, family relationships and culture of origin and underlining key issues to discuss in client counseling. Genograms portray emotional relationships, which allow Sociologists to see and evaluate possible conflicts within the family. Psychological patterns may be detected in the genogram which provide the basis for precautionary and preventive measures that otherwise might not be warranted.\n\nIn social work, genograms are used to display emotional bonds between individuals composing a family or social unit. A genogram will help social workers to make an assessment of the level of cohesiveness within a family or a group and to evaluate if proper care is available within that unit. Genograms also allow displaying social relationships that illustrate the places people attend such as schools, churches, youth facilities, associations or retirement homes.\n\nIn family therapy, genograms are used to study and record relationship patterns between family members and the individual characteristics that make up these patterns that occur. A genogram will help family therapists to make an appropriate assessment of the relationship patterns and where intervention may be needed to help the family reduce the dysfunction and/or problematic situation that brought them into therapy.\n\nIn research, genograms allow researchers to understand multi generational processes within various plant and animal species, such as the development of mutations. Genograms can also illustrate rates of renewal, mechanisms of survival, or processes involved in the regulation of tolerance, among other things.\n\nIn education, genograms can be used by teachers and students for illustrating book reviews, or family trees of a famous politician, philosopher, scientist, musician, etc. They allow them to focus their attention on specific details and also see the big picture of the books and individuals they are studying.\n\nGenograms can be useful in almost any profession that deals with social interaction. Genograms can help to visualize complex interactions between individuals and to study patterns of behaviors or diseases. Genograms are easily created with genealogy software, as advanced software allows the user to include tremendous amounts of data.

Chiari was a supporter of intermedia work conducted between music, speech, gesture and image.\n\nGiuseppe Chiari was born in Florence, Italy on September 26, 1926. In Florence he devoted himself to studying piano and music composition in parallel with studies in mathematics and engineering (1946–51).\n\nHe was especially drawn to the work of John Cage, and himself began to take an interest in promoting experimental research in visual music in 1961. In 1962, at the Fluxus Festspiele internationale Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden, he joined the Fluxus group, taking on the role of artist-composer-philosopher. Among his writings are: Music without counterpoint (1969), Untitled (1971), Mother Music (1973); Teatrino (1974) Art (1974), Method for playing (1976); Aesthetik (1984), Doubt harmony (1990) and Music (1994).\n\nChiari made what he called \"action music\" based on a complex method of execution and traditional instruments: music that takes as its essential element random sounds (water, dry leaves, stones). His work “Giuocare con l’acqua e dire la parola acqua” (“Playing with water and saying the word water”) is quite remarkable for both the transformation of the pages of the script into an aesthetic object, and the clarity and rigour of the texts that preludes to the later production of statements typical of conceptual art. His Work \"Fogli pentagrammati\", 1975, is in Museo cantonale d'arte of Lugano.\n\nChiari experimented with different visual mediums: from painting-collages, sheet music, and photographs. His graphic and pictorial work is partially preserved at the International Centre of Contemporary Art Tornabuoni in Florence.\n\n\n"}

The state is the aim of moksha in Advaita Vedanta, Yoga and other schools of Hinduism, and it is referred to as \"jivanmukti\" (Self-realization).At the end of their life, Jivanmuktas destroy remaining karmas and attain Paramukti (final liberation) and become Paramukta.\n\nJivanmukti contrasts with the concept of \"videhamukti\"; the latter means \"liberation or emancipation after death, in afterlife\".\n\n\"Jivanmukti\" is derived from a combination of Sanskrit words \"jiva\" and \"mukti\", which mean \"life\" and \"freedom\" respectively. The word means, \"liberation during life, liberation before death\", or \"emancipation while still alive\". Others translate it as \"Self realization\", \"living liberation\", \"Enlightenment\", \"liberated soul\", or \"self liberation\".\n\nThe various texts and schools of Hinduism describe \"Jivanmukti\" state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one’s life. Some contrast \"jivanmukti\" with \"videhamukti\" (moksha from samsara after death). Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the enlightened individual shows attributes such as:\n\nAdi Shankara explains that nothing can induce one to act who has no desire of his own to satisfy. The supreme limit of vairagya (\"detachment\"), is the non-springing of \"vasanas\" in respect of enjoyable objects; the non-springing of the sense of the “I” (in things which are the \"ānatman\") is the extreme limit of \"bodha\" (\"awakening\"), and the non-springing again of the modifications which have ceased is the extreme limit of \"Uparati\" (\"abstinence\"). The Jivanmukta gains divine and infinite knowledge and has complet self-knowledge and Self-realization, a Jivanmukta by reason of his ever being Brahman, is freed from awareness of external objects and no longer aware of any difference between the inner atman and Brahman and between Brahman and the world, he knows the he is same as Brahman and has a ever experiencing infinite consciousness. \"Vijnatabrahmatattvasya yathapurvam na samsrtih\" – \"there is no saṃsāra as before for one who has known Brahman\".\n\nThere are three kinds of \"prarabdha karma\": \"Ichha\" (\"personally desired\"), \"Anichha\" (\"without desire\") and \"Parechha\" (\"due to others' desire\"). For a self realized person, a Jivanamukta, there is no \"Ichha-Prarabdha\" but the two others, \"Anichha\" and \"Parechha\", remain, which even a jivanmukta has to undergo. According to the Advaita school for those of wisdom \"Prarabdha\" is liquidated only by experience of its effects; \"Sancita\" (\"accumulated karmas\") and \"Agami\" (\"future karmas\") are destroyed in the fire of \"Jnana\" (\"knowledge\").\n\nThe term Paramukti is commonly used to refer to final liberation, which occurs upon the death of the body of someone who has attained Jivanmukti or Kaivalya during his or her lifetime. It implies the ultimate release of the soul (atman) from the Saṃsāra and karma and merger of the atman in Brahman, so when a Jivanmukta dies he becomes a Paramukta. In the Hindu view, when an ordinary person dies and his physical body disintegrates, the person's unresolved karma causes his atman to pass on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the six realms of samsara. However, when a person attains Jivanmukti, he is liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies and his physical body disintegrates, his cycle of rebirthing ends and he become one with Brahman, then that person is said to have achieved Paramukti and became a Paramukta, so, a Jivanmukta has a body while a Paramukta is bodyless and pure.\nIn the \"śramaṇic\" traditions, the jivanmukta is called an \"arhat\" in Buddhism and \"arihant\" in Jainism.\n\nThe Advaita school holds the view that the world appearance is owing to \"avidya\" (ignorance) that has the power to project i.e. to superimpose the unreal on the real (adhyasa), and also the power to conceal the real resulting in the delusion of the Jiva who experiences objects created by his mind and sees difference in this world, he sees difference between the ātman (\"the individual self\") and Brahman (\"the supreme Self\"). This delusion caused by ignorance is destroyed when ignorance itself is destroyed by knowledge. When all delusion is removed there remains no awareness of difference. He who sees no difference between Self and Brahman is said to be a Jivanmukta. Jivanmukta experience enlightenment and liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences enlightenment and liberation only after death.\nThere are four stages of Jivanmukti:–\n\n1. Sālokya – living in the same world.\n\n2. Sārūpya – having the same form\n\n3. Sāmīpya – being close to\n\n4. Sāyujya – merging into.\n\nSTAGE 1. The first stage is called sālokya — corresponding to the waking state of consciousness (jāgrata) — the realization that the entire vast universe of billions of galaxies and universes is all pervaded by the Divine Consciousness. (Viṣṇu means That which pervades the entire universe and everything in it.) It is the undifferentiated Ocean of Being.\nWhen this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from the idea that the world is separate and independent from us and is an ultimate source of abiding pleasure and joy.\n\nSTAGE 2. The second stage is sarūpya or sadhārmya — corresponding to the dreaming state of consciousness – realization that every being is interconnected and all “apparently” separate jivas are embodiments of the One Divine Consciousness. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from ahaṅkāra - the notion of self-identity and the notion of difference and the other, thus being able to cultivate empathy with all and universal compassion for all beings.\n\nSTAGE 3. The third stage samīpya — is intimacy with the Divine — corresponding to the unconscious dreamless state of consciousness – God-realization occurs when the nature of the saguṇa īśvara is cognized and one surrenders to Him/Her. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from all self-effort to achieve liberation, freedom from religion and its bondage and the relinquishing of all self-imposed burdens – achieving a state of equanimity, tranquility, abiding joy and peace.\n\nSTAGE 4. The final stage sāyujya — communion with, or unification with the Absolute Godhead — corresponding to the Turiya or inconceivable and inexpressible fourth state of consciousness – a merging with the Godhead bordering on complete identity.\nWhen this stage is achieved then the person becomes a complete Jivanmukta and gets the absolute freedom from rebirth and suffering — the final stage of Brahma-nirvāna.\n\nThe Advaita philosophy rests on the premise that noumenally the Absolute alone exists, Nature, Souls and God are all merged in the Absolute; the Universe is one, that there is no difference within it, or without it; Brahman is alike throughout its structure, and the knowledge of any part of it is the knowledge of the whole (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.4.6-14), and, since all causation is ultimately due to Brahman, since everything beside Brahman is an appearance, the Atman is the only entity that exists and nothing else. All elements emanated from the Atman (Taittiriya Upanishad II.1) and all existence is based on Intellect (Aitareya Upanishad III.3). The universe created by Brahman from a part of itself is thrown out and re-absorbed by the Immutable Brahman (Mundaka Upanishad I.1.7). Therefore, the Jiva (the individual self) is non-different from Brahman (the supreme Self), and the Jiva, never bound, is ever liberated. Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of existence and realizes Brahman.\n"}

His family belonged to the sheep-grazing Kuruma Golla caste, a community designated by the Government of India as an Other Backward Class group. Ilaiah credited his mother, Kancha Kattamma, as pivotal in shaping his political thought. According to Ilaiah, she was at the forefront of the Kurumas' struggle against the forest guards' discriminatory behaviour. Kancha Kattamma was killed during a violent confrontation while protesting against police brutality.\n\nA Dalit activist, Ilaiah is often identified as being a Dalit himself in news reports, although he was in fact born into an Other Backward Class community.\n\nIlaiah received an M.A. degree in political science and an M.Phil., awarded for his study of land reform in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. He has been a recipient of the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Award and was a Nehru Fellow between 1994-97.\n\nIlaiah earned a Ph.D on the basis of his work exploring the political dimension of Buddhism, culminating in \"God as Political Philosopher - Buddha Challenge to Brahminism\"..\n\nIlaiah has encouraged proficiency in the English language for Dalits, arguing that it would allow Dalits in India to intellectually engage the world outside India without non-Dalits speaking \"for them\".

{"id": "18488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18488", "title": "Libido", "text": "Libido\n\nLibido (; colloquial: sex drive) is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Libido is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, such as personality and stress, can affect libido. Libido can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality.\n\nA person may have a desire for sex, but not have the opportunity to act on that desire, or may on personal, moral or religious reasons refrain from acting on the urge. Psychologically, a person's urge can be repressed or sublimated. On the other hand, a person can engage in sexual activity without an actual desire for it. Multiple factors affect human sex drive, including stress, illness, pregnancy, and others. A 2001 review found that on average, men have a higher desire for sex than women.\n\nSexual desires are often an important factor in the formation and maintenance of intimate relationships in humans. A lack or loss of sexual desire can adversely affect relationships. Changes in the sexual desires of any partner in a sexual relationship, if sustained and unresolved, may cause problems in the relationship. The infidelity of a partner may be an indication that a partner's changing sexual desires can no longer be satisfied within the current relationship. Problems can arise from disparity of sexual desires between partners, or poor communication between partners of sexual needs and preferences.\n\nSigmund Freud defined libido as \"the energy, regarded as a quantitative magnitude... of those instincts which have to do with all that may be comprised under the word 'love'.\" It is the instinct energy or force, contained in what Freud called the id, the strictly unconscious structure of the psyche.\n\nFreud developed the idea of a series of developmental phases in which the libido fixates on different erogenous zones—first in the oral stage (exemplified by an infant's pleasure in nursing), then in the anal stage (exemplified by a toddler's pleasure in controlling his or her bowels), then in the phallic stage, through a latency stage in which the libido is dormant, to its reemergence at puberty in the genital stage. (Karl Abraham would later add subdivisions in both oral and anal stages.)\n\nFreud pointed out that these libidinal drives can conflict with the conventions of civilised behavior, represented in the psyche by the superego. It is this need to conform to society and control the libido that leads to tension and disturbance in the individual, prompting the use of ego defenses to dissipate the psychic energy of these unmet and mostly unconscious needs into other forms. Excessive use of ego defenses results in neurosis. A primary goal of psychoanalysis is to bring the drives of the id into consciousness, allowing them to be met directly and thus reducing the patient's reliance on ego defenses.\n\nFreud viewed libido as passing through a series of developmental stages within the individual. Failure to adequately adapt to the demands of these different stages could result in libidinal energy becoming 'dammed up' or fixated in these stages, producing certain pathological character traits in adulthood. Thus the psychopathologized individual for Freud was an immature individual, and the goal of psychoanalysis was to bring these fixations to conscious awareness so that the libido energy would be freed up and available for conscious use in some sort of constructive sublimation.\n\nAccording to Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, the libido is identified as the totality of psychic energy, not limited to sexual desire. As Jung states in \"The Concept of Libido,\" \"[libido] denotes a desire or impulse which is unchecked by any kind of authority, moral or otherwise. Libido is appetite in its natural state. From the genetic point of view it is bodily needs like hunger, thirst, sleep, and sex, and emotional states or affects, which constitute the essence of libido.\" The Duality (opposition) creates the energy (or libido) of the psyche, which Jung asserts expresses itself only through symbols: \"It is the energy that manifests itself in the life process and is perceived subjectively as striving and desire.\" (Ellenberger, 697) These symbols may manifest as \"fantasy-images\" in the process of psychoanalysis which embody the contents of the libido, otherwise lacking in any definite form. Desire, conceived generally as a psychic longing, movement, displacement and structuring, manifests itself in definable forms which are apprehended through analysis.\n\nDefined more narrowly, libido also refers to an individual's urge to engage in sexual activity, and its antonym is the force of destruction termed mortido or destrudo.\n\nLibido is governed primarily by activity in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens). Consequently, dopamine and related trace amines (primarily phenethylamine) that modulate dopamine neurotransmission play a critical role in regulating libido.\n\nOther neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and sex hormones that affect sex drive by modulating activity in or acting upon this pathway include:\n\nA woman's desire for sex is correlated to her menstrual cycle, with many women experiencing a heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before ovulation, which is her peak fertility period, which normally occurs two days before until two days after the ovulation. This cycle has been associated with changes in a woman's testosterone levels during the menstrual cycle. According to Gabrielle Lichterman, testosterone levels have a direct impact on a woman's interest in sex. According to her, testosterone levels rise gradually from about the 24th day of a woman's menstrual cycle until ovulation on about the 14th day of the next cycle, and during this period the woman's desire for sex increases consistently. The 13th day is generally the day with the highest testosterone levels. In the week following ovulation, the testosterone level is the lowest and as a result women will experience less interest in sex.\n\nAlso, during the week following ovulation, progesterone levels increase, resulting in a woman experiencing difficulty achieving orgasm. Although the last days of the menstrual cycle are marked by a constant testosterone level, women's libido may get a boost as a result of the thickening of the uterine lining which stimulates nerve endings and makes a woman feel aroused. Also, during these days, estrogen levels decline, resulting in a decrease of natural lubrication.\n\nAlthough some specialists disagree with this theory, menopause is still considered by the majority a factor that can cause decreased sex desire in women. The levels of estrogen decrease at menopause and this usually causes a lower interest in sex and vaginal dryness which makes intercourse painful. However, the levels of testosterone increase at menopause and this may be why some women may experience a contrary effect of an increased libido.\n\nCertain psychological or social factors can reduce the desire for sex. These factors can include lack of privacy or intimacy, stress or fatigue, distraction or depression. Environmental stress, such as prolonged exposure to elevated sound levels or bright light, can also affect libido. Other causes include experience of sexual abuse, assault, trauma, or neglect, body image issues, and anxiety about engaging in sexual activity.\n\nPhysical factors that can affect libido include endocrine issues such as hypothyroidism, the effect of certain prescription medications (for example flutamide), and the attractiveness and biological fitness of one's partner, among various other lifestyle factors.\n\nIn males, the frequency of ejaculations affects the levels of serum testosterone, a hormone which promotes libido. A study of 28 males aged 21–45 found that all but one of them had a peak (145.7% of baseline [117.8%–197.3%]) in serum testosterone on the 7th day of abstinence from ejaculation.\n\nAnemia is a cause of lack of libido in women due to the loss of iron during the period.\n\nSmoking, alcohol abuse, and the use of certain drugs can also lead to a decreased libido. Moreover, specialists suggest that several lifestyle changes such as exercising, quitting smoking, lowering consumption of alcohol or using prescription drugs may help increase one's sexual desire.\n\nSome people purposefully attempt to increase their libido through the usage of anaphrodisiacs. Aphrodisiacs, such as dopaminergic psychostimulants, are a class of drugs which can increase libido. On the other hand, a reduced libido is also often iatrogenic and can be caused by many medications, such as hormonal contraception, SSRIs and other antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids and beta blockers.\n\nTestosterone is one of the hormones controlling libido in human beings. Emerging research is showing that hormonal contraception methods like oral contraceptive pills (which rely on estrogen and progesterone together) are causing low libido in females by elevating levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). SHBG binds to sex hormones, including testosterone, rendering them unavailable. Research is showing that even after ending a hormonal contraceptive method, SHBG levels remain elevated and no reliable data exists to predict when this phenomenon will diminish.\n\nMales reach the peak of their sex drive in their teens, while females reach it in their thirties. The surge in testosterone hits the male at puberty resulting in a sudden and extreme sex drive which reaches its peak at age 15–16, then drops slowly over his lifetime. In contrast, a female's libido increases slowly during adolescence and peaks in her mid-thirties. Actual testosterone and estrogen levels that affect a person's sex drive vary considerably.\n\nThere is no widely accepted measure of what is a healthy level for sex desire. Some people want to have sex every day, or more than once a day; others once a year or not at all. However, a person who lacks a desire for sexual activity for some period of time may be experiencing a hypoactive sexual desire disorder or may be asexual. A sexual desire disorder is more common in women than in men. Erectile dysfunction may happen to the penis because of lack of sexual desire, but these two should not be confused. For example, large recreational doses of amphetamine or methamphetamine can simultaneously cause erectile dysfunction and significantly increase libido. However, men can also experience a decrease in their libido as they age.\n\nThe American Medical Association has estimated that several million US women suffer from a female sexual arousal disorder, though arousal is not at all synonymous with desire, so this finding is of limited relevance to the discussion of libido. Some specialists claim that women may experience low libido due to some hormonal abnormalities such as lack of luteinising hormone or androgenic hormones, although these theories are still controversial. Also, women commonly lack sexual desire in the period immediately after giving birth. Moreover, any condition affecting the genital area can make women reject the idea of having intercourse. It has been estimated that half of women experience different health problems in the area of the vagina and vulva, such as thinning, tightening, dryness or atrophy. Frustration may appear as a result of these issues and because many of them lead to painful sexual intercourse, many women prefer not having sex at all. Surgery or major health conditions such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease or infertility may have the same effect in women. Surgery that affects the hormonal levels in women include oophorectomies.\n\n"}

It is an extension of Aristotle's square of opposition. It was discovered independently by both Augustin Sesmat and Robert Blanché.\n\nThis extension consists in introducing two statements U and Y. Whereas U is the disjunction of A and E, Y is the conjunction of the two traditional particulars I and O.\n\nThe traditional square of opposition demonstrates two sets of contradictories A and O, and E and I (i.e. they cannot both be true and cannot both be false), two contraries A and E (i.e. they can both be false, but cannot both be true), and two subcontraries I and O (i.e. they can both be true, but cannot both be false) according to Aristotle’s definitions.

{"id": "9604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9604", "title": "Many-worlds interpretation", "text": "Many-worlds interpretation\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts the objective reality of the universal wavefunction and denies the actuality of wavefunction collapse. Many-worlds implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real, each representing an actual \"world\" (or \"universe\"). In layman's terms, the hypothesis states there is a very large—perhaps infinite—number of universes, and everything that could possibly have happened in our past, but did not, has occurred in the past of some other universe or universes. The theory is also referred to as MWI, the relative state formulation, the Everett interpretation, the theory of the universal wavefunction, many-universes interpretation, multiverse theory or just many-worlds.\n\nThe original relative state formulation is due to Hugh Everett in 1957. Later, this formulation was popularized and renamed \"many-worlds\" by Bryce Seligman DeWitt in the 1960s and 1970s. The decoherence approaches to interpreting quantum theory have been further explored and developed, becoming quite popular. MWI is one of many multiverse hypotheses in physics and philosophy. It is currently considered a mainstream interpretation along with the other decoherence interpretations, collapse theories (including the historical Copenhagen interpretation), and hidden variable theories such as the Bohmian mechanics.\n\nBefore many-worlds, reality had always been viewed as a single unfolding history. Many-worlds, however, views historical reality as a many-branched tree, wherein every possible quantum outcome is realised. Many-worlds reconciles the observation of non-deterministic events, such as random radioactive decay, with the fully deterministic equations of quantum physics.\n\nIn many-worlds, the subjective appearance of wavefunction collapse is explained by the mechanism of quantum decoherence, and this is supposed to resolve all of the correlation paradoxes of quantum theory, such as the EPR paradox and Schrödinger's cat, since every possible outcome of every event defines or exists in its own \"history\" or \"world\".\n\nIn Dublin in 1952 Erwin Schrödinger gave a lecture in which at one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might \"seem lunatic\". He went on to assert that what the equation that won him a Nobel prize seems to be describing is several different histories, they are \"not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously\". This is the earliest known reference to the many-worlds.\n\nAlthough several versions of many-worlds have been proposed since Hugh Everett's original work, they all contain one key idea: the equations of physics that model the time evolution of systems \"without\" embedded observers are sufficient for modelling systems which \"do\" contain observers; in particular there is no observation-triggered wave function collapse which the Copenhagen interpretation proposes. Provided the theory is linear with respect to the wavefunction, the exact form of the quantum dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, relativistic quantum field theory or some form of quantum gravity or string theory, does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a metatheory applicable to all linear quantum theories, and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics. MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or multiverse in this context) is composed of a quantum superposition of very many, possibly even non-denumerably infinitely many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.\n\nThe idea of MWI originated in Everett's Princeton Ph.D. thesis \"The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction\", developed under his thesis advisor John Archibald Wheeler, a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 entitled \"Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\" (Wheeler contributed the title \"relative state\"; Everett originally called his approach the \"Correlation Interpretation\", where \"correlation\" refers to quantum entanglement). The phrase \"many-worlds\" is due to Bryce DeWitt, who was responsible for the wider popularisation of Everett's theory, which had been largely ignored for the first decade after publication. DeWitt's phrase \"many-worlds\" has become so much more popular than Everett's \"Universal Wavefunction\" or Everett–Wheeler's \"Relative State Formulation\" that many forget that this is only a difference of terminology; the content of both of Everett's papers and DeWitt's popular article is the same.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with later, other \"post-Everett\" interpretations of quantum mechanics which also use decoherence to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real since it regards the universal wavefunction as the \"basic physical entity\" or \"the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation\". The other decoherent interpretations, such as consistent histories, the Existential Interpretation etc., either regard the extra quantum worlds as metaphorical in some sense, or are agnostic about their reality; it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the different varieties. MWI is distinguished by two qualities: it assumes realism, which it assigns to the wavefunction, and it has the minimal formal structure possible, rejecting any hidden variables, quantum potential, any form of a collapse postulate (i.e., Copenhagenism) or mental postulates (such as the many-minds interpretation makes).\n\nDecoherent interpretations of many-worlds using einselection to explain how a small number of classical pointer states can emerge from the enormous Hilbert space of superpositions have been proposed by Wojciech H. Zurek. \"Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected.\" These ideas complement MWI and bring the interpretation in line with our perception of reality.\n\nMany-worlds is often referred to as a theory, rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as David Deutsch) or is falsifiable (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; Hugh Everett argued that his formulation was a metatheory, since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the \"only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world.\" Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an \"interpretation\", saying that calling it an interpretation \"is like talking about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records.\"\n\nAs with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the double-slit experiment. When particles of light (or anything else) are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"collapse\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and \"ad hoc\", so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an alternative interpretation. Everett stated that for a composite system – for example a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle) – the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become entangled; we can only specify the state of one \"relative\" to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated \"after\" the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a \"relativity of states\".\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone decreed that after an observation is made each element of the quantum superposition of the combined subject–object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject–object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, \"as if\" wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the \"appearance\" of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory). Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking Occam's razor, he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\nAccording to Martin Gardner, the \"other\" worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claims that Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured by the majority of physicists, whereas the \"realist\" view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that \"according to Feynman's idea\", all the other histories are as \"equally real\" as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is \"trivially true\". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as \"self-evidently correct\" but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, \"When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I reach for my gun.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities.\" Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the \"reality\" of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, \"He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully.\" For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.\n\nKim Joris Boström has proposed a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory that combines elements of the de Broglie–Bohm mechanics and that of Everett’s many-‘worlds’. In particular, the unreal MW interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch ‘worlds’:\n\nAttempts have been made, by many-world advocates and others, over the years to \"derive\" the Born rule, rather than just conventionally \"assume\" it, so as to reproduce all the required statistical behaviour associated with quantum mechanics. There is no consensus on whether this has been successful.\n\nEverett (1957) briefly derived the Born rule by showing that the Born rule was the only possible rule, and that its derivation was as justified as the procedure for defining probability in classical mechanics. Everett stopped doing research in theoretical physics shortly after obtaining his Ph.D., but his work on probability has been extended by a number of people. Andrew Gleason (1957) and James Hartle (1965) independently reproduced Everett's work which was later extended. These results are closely related to Gleason's theorem, a mathematical result according to which the Born probability measure is the only one on Hilbert space that can be constructed purely from the quantum state vector.\n\nBryce DeWitt and his doctoral student R. Neill Graham later provided alternative (and longer) derivations to Everett's derivation of the Born rule. They demonstrated that the norm of the worlds where the usual statistical rules of quantum theory broke down vanished, in the limit where the number of measurements went to infinity.\n\nA decision-theoretic derivation of the Born rule from Everettarian assumptions, was produced by David Deutsch (1999) and refined by Wallace (2002–2009) and Saunders (2004). Some reviews have been positive, although the status of these arguments remains highly controversial; some theoretical physicists have taken them as supporting the case for parallel universes. In the \"New Scientist\" article, reviewing their presentation at a September 2007 conference, Andy Albrecht, a physicist at the University of California at Davis, is quoted as saying \"This work will go down as one of the most important developments in the history of science.\"\n\nThe Born rule and the collapse of the wave function have been obtained in the framework of the relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics by Armando V. D. B. Assis. He has proved that the Born rule and the collapse of the wave function follow from a game-theoretical strategy, namely the Nash equilibrium within a von Neumann zero-sum game between nature and observer.\n\nWojciech H. Zurek (2005) has produced a derivation of the Born rule, where decoherence has replaced Deutsch's informatic assumptions. Lutz Polley (2000) has produced Born rule derivations where the informatic assumptions are replaced by symmetry arguments.\n\nCharles Sebens and Sean M. Carroll, building on work by Lev Vaidman, proposed a similar approach based on self-locating uncertainty. In this approach, decoherence creates multiple identical copies of observers, who can assign credences to being on different branches using the Born rule.\n\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus M and an object system S form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing M and S to interact. After S interacts with M, it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of S given the state of M or the relative state of M given the state of S. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of S after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of S.\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system S, as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the \"z\"-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by (the surface of) a sphere called the Bloch sphere. To perform a measurement on S, it is made to interact with another similar system M. After the interaction, the combined system is described by a state that ranges over a six-dimensional space (the reason for the number six is explained in the article on the Bloch sphere). This six-dimensional object can also be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system S, one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system M) causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 copies of the original system S.\n\nThe accepted terminology is somewhat misleading because it is incorrect to regard the universe as splitting at certain times; at any given instant there is one state in one universe.\n\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by Paul Dirac, von Neumann and others, discarding altogether the \"ad hoc\" mechanism of wave function collapse.\n\nSince Everett's original work, there have appeared a number of similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett's work, who had referred to the combined observer–object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a possible tree as shown in the graphic below. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree. Note that \"splitting\" in this sense is hardly new or even quantum mechanical. The idea of a space of complete alternative histories had already been used in the theory of probability since the mid-1930s for instance to model Brownian motion. \n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the Schrödinger equation, or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer \"and\" the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer–object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or entangled and it is no longer possible to consider them independent of one another. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now \"correlated\" with its \"relative state\", since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the quantum measurement process by replacing wavefunction collapse with quantum decoherence. Since the role of the observer lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, the EPR paradox, von Neumann's \"boundary problem\" and even wave-particle duality. Quantum cosmology also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.\n\nMWI is a realist, deterministic, arguably local theory, akin to classical physics (including the theory of relativity), at the expense of losing counterfactual definiteness. MWI achieves this by removing wavefunction collapse, which is indeterministic and non-local, from the deterministic and local equations of quantum theory.\n\nMWI (or other, broader multiverse considerations) provides a context for the anthropic principle which may provide an explanation for the fine-tuned universe.\n\nMWI, being a decoherent formulation, is axiomatically more streamlined than the Copenhagen and other collapse interpretations; and thus favoured under certain interpretations of Occam's razor. Of course there are other decoherent interpretations that also possess this advantage with respect to the collapse interpretations.\n\nOne of the salient properties of the many-worlds interpretation is that it does not require an exceptional method of wave function collapse to explain it. \"It seems that there is no experiment distinguishing the MWI from other no-collapse theories such as Bohmian mechanics or other variants of MWI... In most no-collapse interpretations, the evolution of the quantum state of the Universe is the same. Still, one might imagine that there is an experiment distinguishing the MWI from another no-collapse interpretation based on the difference in the correspondence between the formalism and the experience (the results of experiments).\"\n\nHowever, in 1985, David Deutsch published three related thought experiments which could test the theory vs the Copenhagen interpretation. The experiments require macroscopic quantum state preparation and quantum erasure by a hypothetical quantum computer which is currently outside experimental possibility. Since then Lockwood (1989), Vaidman and others have made similar proposals. These proposals also require an advanced technology which is able to place a macroscopic object in a coherent superposition, another task which it is uncertain will ever be possible to perform. Many other controversial ideas have been put forward though, such as a recent claim that cosmological observations could test the theory, and another claim by Rainer Plaga (1997), published in \"Foundations of Physics\", that communication might be possible between worlds.\n\nIn the Copenhagen interpretation, the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows one to predict probabilities for the occurrence of various events. When an event occurs, it becomes part of the definite reality, and alternative possibilities do not. There is no necessity to say anything definite about what is not observed.\n\nAny event that changes the number of observers in the universe may have experimental consequences. Quantum tunnelling to a new vacuum state would reduce the number of observers to zero (i.e., kill all life). Some cosmologists argue that the universe is in a false vacuum state and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state. This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This can be thought of as a variation on quantum suicide.\n\nThe \"many-minds\" interpretation is a multi-world interpretation that defines the splitting of reality on the level of the observers' minds. In this, it differs from Everett's many-worlds interpretation, in which there is no special role for the observer's mind.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is very vague about the ways to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion is that the two branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/\"do not interact\", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that it is not clear what is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.\n\nMWI states that there is no special role, or need for precise definition of measurement in MWI, yet Everett uses the word \"measurement\" repeatedly throughout its exposition.\n\nThe splitting of worlds forward in time, but not backwards in time (i.e., merging worlds), is time asymmetric and incompatible with the time symmetric nature of Schrödinger's equation, or CPT invariance in general.\n\nThere is circularity in Everett's measurement theory. Under the assumptions made by Everett, there are no 'good observations' as defined by him, and since his analysis of the observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the projection postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without any discussion.\n\nTalk of probability in Everett presumes the existence of a preferred basis to identify measurement outcomes for the probabilities to range over. But the existence of a preferred basis can only be established by the process of decoherence, which is itself probabilistic or arbitrary.\n\nWe cannot be sure that the universe is a quantum multiverse until we have a theory of everything and, in particular, a successful theory of quantum gravity. If the final theory of everything is non-linear with respect to wavefunctions then many-worlds would be invalid.\n\nConservation of energy is grossly violated if at every instant near-infinite amounts of new matter are generated to create the new universes.\n\nOccam's razor rules against a plethora of unobservable universes – Occam would prefer just one universe; i.e., any non-MWI.\n\nUnphysical universes: If a state is a superposition of two states formula_3 and formula_4, i.e., formula_5, i.e., weighted by coefficients \"a\" and \"b\", then if formula_6, what principle allows a universe with vanishingly small probability \"b\" to be instantiated on an equal footing with the much more probable one with probability \"a\"? This seems to throw away the information in the probability amplitudes.\n\nViolation of the principle of locality, which contradicts special relativity: MWI splitting is instant and total: this may conflict with relativity, since an alien in the Andromeda galaxy can't know I collapse an electron over here before she collapses hers there: the relativity of simultaneity says we can't say which electron collapsed first – so which one splits off another universe first? This leads to a hopeless muddle with everyone splitting differently. Note: EPR is not a get-out here, as the alien's and my electrons need never have been part of the same quantum, i.e., entangled.\n\nThere is a wide range of claims that are considered \"many-worlds\" interpretations. It was often claimed by those who do not believe in MWI that Everett himself was not entirely clear as to what he believed; however, MWI adherents (such as DeWitt, Tegmark, Deutsch and others) believe they fully understand Everett's meaning as implying the literal existence of the other worlds. Additionally, recent biographical sources make it clear that Everett believed in the literal reality of the other quantum worlds. Everett's son reported that Hugh Everett \"never wavered in his belief over his many-worlds theory\". Also Everett was reported to believe \"his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality\".\n\nOne of MWI's strongest advocates is David Deutsch. According to Deutsch, the single photon interference pattern observed in the double slit experiment can be explained by interference of photons in multiple universes. Viewed in this way, the single photon interference experiment is indistinguishable from the multiple photon interference experiment. In a more practical vein, in one of the earliest papers on quantum computing, he suggested that parallelism that results from the validity of MWI could lead to \"a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it\". Deutsch has also proposed that when reversible computers become conscious then MWI will be testable (at least against \"naive\" Copenhagenism) via the reversible observation of spin.\n\nAsher Peres was an outspoken critic of MWI. For example, a section in his 1993 textbook had the title \"Everett's interpretation and other bizarre theories\". Peres not only questioned whether MWI is really an \"interpretation\", but rather, if \"any\" interpretations of quantum mechanics are needed at all. An interpretation can be regarded as a purely formal transformation, which adds nothing to the rules of the quantum mechanics. Peres seems to suggest that positing the existence of an infinite number of non-communicating parallel universes is highly suspect per those who interpret it as a violation of Occam's razor, i.e., that it does not minimize the number of hypothesized entities. However, it is understood that the number of elementary particles are not a gross violation of Occam's razor, one counts the types, not the tokens. Max Tegmark remarks that the alternative to many-worlds is \"many words\", an allusion to the complexity of von Neumann's collapse postulate. On the other hand, the same derogatory qualification \"many words\" is often applied to MWI by its critics who see it as a word game which obfuscates rather than clarifies by confounding the von Neumann branching of possible worlds with the Schrödinger parallelism of many worlds in superposition.\n\nMWI is considered by some to be unfalsifiable and hence unscientific because the multiple parallel universes are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them. Others claim MWI is directly testable. Everett regarded MWI as falsifiable since any test that falsifies conventional quantum theory would also falsify MWI.\n\nAdvocates of MWI often cite a poll of 72 \"leading cosmologists and other quantum field theorists\" conducted by the American political scientist David Raub in 1995 showing 58% agreement with \"Yes, I think MWI is true\".\n\nHowever, the poll is controversial. For example, Victor J. Stenger remarks that Murray Gell-Mann's published work explicitly rejects the existence of simultaneous parallel universes. Collaborating with James Hartle, Gell-Mann is working toward the development a more \"palatable\" \"post-Everett quantum mechanics\". Stenger thinks it's fair to say that most physicists dismiss the many-world interpretation as too extreme, while noting it \"has merit in finding a place for the observer inside the system being analyzed and doing away with the troublesome notion of wave function collapse\".\n\nMax Tegmark also reports the result of a \"highly unscientific\" poll taken at a 1997 quantum mechanics workshop. According to Tegmark, \"The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the consistent histories and Bohm interpretations.\" Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to Sean Carroll's observation, \"As crazy as it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory\" Michael Nielsen counters: \"at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence.\" However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: Asher Peres \"got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he got up at the end of the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'\" \n\nA 2005 poll of fewer than 40 students and researchers taken after a course on the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics at the Institute for Quantum Computing University of Waterloo found \"Many Worlds (and decoherence)\" to be the least favored.\n\nA 2011 poll of 33 participants at an Austrian conference found 6 endorsed MWI, 8 \"Information-based/information-theoretical\", and 14 Copenhagen; the authors remark that the results are similar to the previous Tegmark's 1998 poll.\n\nSpeculative physics deals with questions which are also discussed in science fiction.\n\nQuantum suicide, as a thought experiment, was published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987 and Bruno Marchal in 1988 and was independently developed further by Max Tegmark in 1998. It attempts to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, from the cat's point of view. Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.\n\nAnother speculation is that the separate worlds remain weakly coupled (e.g., by gravity) permitting \"communication between parallel universes\". A possible test of this using quantum-optical equipment is described in a 1997 \"Foundations of Physics\" article by Rainer Plaga. It involves an isolated ion in an ion trap, a quantum measurement that would yield two parallel worlds (their difference just being in the detection of a single photon), and the excitation of the ion from only one of these worlds. If the excited ion can be detected from the other parallel universe, then this would constitute direct evidence in support of the many-worlds interpretation and would automatically exclude the orthodox, \"logical\", and \"many-histories\" interpretations. The reason the ion is isolated is to make it not participate immediately in the decoherence which insulates the parallel world branches, therefore allowing it to act as a gateway between the two worlds, and if the measure apparatus could perform the measurements quickly enough before the gateway ion is decoupled then the test would succeed (with electronic computers the necessary time window between the two worlds would be in a time scale of milliseconds or nanoseconds, and if the measurements are taken by humans then a few seconds would still be enough). R. Plaga shows that macroscopic decoherence timescales are a possibility. The proposed test is based on technical equipment described in a 1993 \"Physical Review\" article by Itano et al. and R. Plaga says that this level of technology is enough to realize the proposed inter-world communication experiment. The necessary technology for precision measurements of single ions already exists since the 1970s, and the ion recommended for excitation is Hg. The excitation methodology is described by Itano et al. and the time needed for it is given by the Rabi flopping formula.\n\nSuch a test as described by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe and not for the single parallel branches. Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a degree of freedom of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by Welcher Weg detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).\n\nThe proposed test would allow for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment. Because of the time needed to determine the state of the partially decohered isolated excited ion based on Itano et al.'s methodology, the ion would decohere by the time its state is determined during the experiment, so Plaga's proposal would pass just enough information between the two worlds to confirm their parallel existence and nothing more. The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds. For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process were found for the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194 nm photons.\n\nA 1991 article by J. Polchinski also supports the view that inter-world communication is a theoretical possibility. Other authors in a 1994 preprint article also contemplated similar ideas.\n\nThe reason inter-world communication seems like a possibility is because decoherence which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete, therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them, and these should be measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 \"International Journal of Theoretical Physics\" article, but the technology it requires involves human-level artificial intelligence.\n\nMany MWI proponents assert that every physically possible event has to be represented in the multiversal stack, and by definition this would include highly unlikely scenarios and timelines.\nBryce Seligman DeWitt has stated that \"[Everett, Wheeler and Graham] do not in the end exclude any element of the superposition. All the worlds are there, even those in which everything goes wrong and all the statistical laws break down.\" \nBorrowing a phase from T.H. White's The Once and Future King, Murray Gell-Mann describes the implications of his Totalitarian principle, as \"Everything not forbidden is compulsory.\"\nMax Tegmark has affirmed in numerous statements that absurd or highly unlikely events are inevitable under the MWI interpretation. To quote Tegmark, \"Things inconsistent with the laws of physics will never happen - everything else will... it's important to keep track of the statistics, since even if everything conceivable happens somewhere, really freak events happen only exponentially rarely\". \nFrank J. Tipler, although a strong advocate for the many-worlds interpretation, has expressed some skepticism regarding this aspect of the theory. In a 2015 interview he stated \"We simply don't know...it might be that the modulus over the wavefunction of that possibility [i.e. an extremely absurd yet physically possible event] is zero in which case there is no such world...There are universes out there, which you could imagine which...would not be actualized.\" \n\nThe many-worlds interpretation has some similarity to modal realism in philosophy, which is the view that the possible worlds used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-testing problem or the Quantum Zeno effect. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way things could conceivably have been.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation could be one possible way to resolve the paradoxes that one would expect to arise \"if\" time travel turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting closed timelike curves and thus violating causality). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the Novikov self-consistency principle unnecessary.\n\n\"Star Trek\" uses many-worlds in many stories. In the \"\", Spock and Kirk and encounter versions of themselves from the other universe.

This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable. \n\nIn predicate logic, if \"P\" is a predicate over the natural numbers, it is expressed as:\n\nThat is, if \"P\" is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number \"n\", then it is true for some \"n\". (In general, a predicate \"P\" over some domain is called \"decidable\" if for every \"x\" in the domain, either \"P\"(\"x\") is true, or \"P\"(\"x\") is not true, which is not always the case constructively.)\n\nIt is equivalent in the language of arithmetic to:\nfor formula_3 a total recursive function on the natural numbers.\n\nIt is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles:\n\n\nIf constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the formula_4-consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that formula_5 is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if formula_6 is true. If formula_5 is not everywhere false, then by formula_4-consistency there must be a term for which formula_5 holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however formula_5 does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), formula_5 must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer.\n\nIf instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis \"and Markov's principle\" if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic. \n\nModified realizability does not justify Markov's principle, even if classical logic is used in the meta-theory: there is no realizer in the language of simply typed lambda calculus as this language is not Turing-complete and arbitrary loops cannot be defined in it.\n\nMarkov's rule is the formulation of Markov's principle as a rule. It states that formula_12 is derivable as soon as formula_13 is, for formula_5 decidable. It was proved by Anne S. Troelstra that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in Heyting arithmetic. Later on, the logician Harvey Friedman showed that Markov's rule is an admissible rule in all of intuitionistic logic, Heyting arithmetic, and various other intuitionistic theories, using the Friedman translation.\n\nA weaker form of Markov's principle may be stated in the language of analysis as\n\nThis form can be justified by Brouwer's continuity principles, whereas the stronger form contradicts them. Thus it can be derived from intuitionistic, realizability, and classical reasoning, in each case for different reasons, but this principle is not valid in the general constructive sense of Bishop.\n\n\n"}

They became valuable trade items during the Musket Wars of the early 19th century.\n\nMoko facial tattoos were traditional in Māori culture until about the mid 19th century when their use began to disappear, although there has been something of a revival from the late 20th century. In pre-European Māori culture they denoted high social status. There were generally only men that had full facial moko, though high-ranked women often had moko on their lips and chins. Moko tattoos served as identifying connection between an individual and their ancestors.\n\nMoko marked rites of passage for people of chiefly rank, as well as significant events in their lives. Each moko was unique and contained information about the person’s rank, tribe, lineage, occupation and exploits. Moko were expensive to obtain and elaborate moko were usually limited to chiefs and high-ranked warriors. Moreover, the art of moko, the people who created and incised the designs, as well as the moko themselves, were surrounded by strict tapu and protocol.\n\nWhen someone with moko died, often the head would be preserved. The brain and eyes were removed, with all orifices sealed with flax fibre and gum. The head was then boiled or steamed in an oven before being smoked over an open fire and dried in the sun for several days. It was then treated with shark oil. Such preserved heads, mokomokai, would be kept by their families in ornately carved boxes and brought out only for sacred ceremonies.\n\nThe heads of enemy chiefs killed in battle were also preserved; these mokomokai, being considered trophies of war, would be displayed on the marae and mocked. They were important in diplomatic negotiations between warring tribes, with the return and exchange of mokomokai being an essential precondition for peace.\n\nIn the early 19th century, with the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, tribes in contact with European sailors, traders and settlers had access to firearms, giving them a military advantage over their neighbours. This gave rise to the Musket Wars, when other tribes became desperate to acquire firearms too, if only to defend themselves. During this period of social destabilisation, mokomokai became commercial trade items that could be sold as curios, artworks and as museum specimens which fetched high prices in Europe and America, and which could be bartered for firearms and ammunition.\n\nThe demand for firearms was such that tribes carried out raids on their neighbours to acquire more heads to trade for them. They also tattooed slaves and prisoners (though with meaningless motifs rather than genuine moko) in order to provide heads to order. The peak years of the trade in mokomokai were from 1820 to 1831. In 1831 the Governor of New South Wales issued a proclamation banning further trade in heads out of New Zealand, and during the 1830s the demand for firearms diminished because of market saturation. By 1840 when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, and New Zealand became a British colony, the export trade in mokomokai had virtually ended, along with a decline in the use of moko in Māori society, although occasional small-scale trade continued for several years.\n\nMajor-General Horatio Gordon Robley was a British army officer and artist who served in New Zealand during the New Zealand land wars in the 1860s. He was interested in ethnology and fascinated by the art of tattooing as well as being a talented illustrator. He wrote the classic text on the subject of moko, \"Moko; or Maori Tattooing\", which was published in 1896. After he returned to England he built up a notable collection of 35–40 mokomokai which he later offered to sell to the New Zealand Government. When the offer was declined, most of the collection was sold to the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nMore recently there has been a campaign to repatriate to New Zealand the hundreds of mokomokai held in museums and private collections around the world, either to be returned to their relatives or to the Museum of New Zealand for storage, though not display. It has had some success, though many mokomokai remain overseas and the campaign is ongoing.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been used in various ways such as to relate God or divinity with concrete things, determinism, or the substance of the Universe. God, from these perspectives, is seen as the aggregate of all unified natural phenomena. The phrase has often been associated with the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza, although academics differ on how it is used.\n\nThe term “pantheism\" is derived from Greek words \"pan\" (Greek: πᾶν) meaning \"all\" and \"theos\" (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by Joseph Raphson in his work \"De spatio reali\", published in 1697. The term was introduced to English by Irish writer John Toland in his 1705 work \"Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist\" that described pantheism as the \"opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe.\"\n\nThe term \"naturalistic\" derives from the word \"naturalism\", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics. In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, \"i.e.\" the sciences. It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.\n\nJoseph Needham, a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified Taoism as \"a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature.\" This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.\n\nThe Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of Stoicism (which started in the early 3rd century BCE) rejected the dualist idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven. However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.\n\nNaturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers, including Giordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake for his views. However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.\n\nPossibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,\nBaruch Spinoza connected God and Nature through the phrase \"deus sive natura\" (\"God, or Nature\"), making him the father of classical pantheism. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as Spinozism, has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the Pantheism controversy. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural. \nOthers focus on the deterministic aspect of naturalism.\nSpinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature. However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.\nScholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.\n\nIn 1705 the Irish writer John Toland endorsed a form of pantheism in which the God-soul is identical with the material universe.\n\nGerman naturalist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) proposed a monistic pantheism in which the idea of God is identical with that of nature or substance.\n\nThe World Pantheist Movement, started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, realism, strong naturalism, and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world. Paul Harrison considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.\n\n"}

In non-well-founded set theories, the foundation axiom of ZFC is replaced by axioms implying its negation.\n\nThe study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by Dmitry Mirimanoff in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an axiom. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until Peter Aczel’s hyperset theory in 1988.\n\nThe theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the logical modelling of non-terminating computational processes in computer science (process algebra and final semantics), linguistics and natural language semantics (situation theory), philosophy (work on the Liar Paradox), and in a different setting, non-standard analysis.\n\nIn 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced the concept of well-foundedness of a set:\n\nIn ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the axiom of regularity. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the \"foundation axiom\" since it can be proved within ZFC (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the axiom of regularity, the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set \"A\" such that \"A\" ∈ \"A\" is non-well-founded.\n\nAlthough Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation. In 1926, Paul Finsler introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of von Neumann 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades. An early non-well-founded set theory was Willard Van Orman Quine’s New Foundations, although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.\n\nSeveral proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by Paul Bernays (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by Ernst Specker who gave a different proof in his Habilitationsschrift of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 Rieger's theorem was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems. The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of Dana Scott (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called SAFA. Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was Maurice Boffa's axiom of superuniversality, described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade. Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every extensional set-like relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.\n\nA more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a bisimulation. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the axiom of extensionality. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as anti-foundation axioms, and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a hyperset.\n\nFour mutually independent anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:\nThey essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on accessible pointed graphs (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg. Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called Quine atom, formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.\n\nEach of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: V ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.\n\nAczel’s hypersets were extensively used by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy in their 1987 book \"The Liar\", on the liar's paradox; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.\n\nBoffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic nonstandard analysis.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8428553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8428553", "title": "Professional courtesy", "text": "Professional courtesy\n\nProfessional courtesy generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.\n\nWhile the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.\n\nIn 1803, Thomas Percival wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families, known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.\n\nAmong physicians, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members. The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family. The custom dates back to Hippocrates, well before physicians reached middle-class income levels. However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.\n\nIn 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.\n\nThe term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement \"professional courtesy\":\n\nFirst, some states (such as California) issue \"confidential plates\" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge. Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy \"discretion\", and federal law assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.\n\nThird, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a \"family card\" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member. Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way. The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.\n\nUntil the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of Actors Equity and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the Off-Off-Broadway world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time. This applies as well to \"bona fide\" producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.\n"}

It is related to the \"prasangika\" approach, which argues that no syllogistic forms of reasoning should be used to debate the notion of inherent existence, but only arguments which show the logical implications and absurdity of positions based upon inherent existence. This position is the mainstream Gelugpa interpretation of Madhyamaka, one of the main Mahayana schools, which dominates Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\n\"Shentong\" (, also transliterated \"zhäntong\" or \"zhentong\"; literally \"other-emptiness\") is a position within Tibetan Madhyamaka. It applies \"śūnyatā\" in a specific way, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality (\"Paramarthasatya\") is \"non-dual Buddhajnana\" and \"empty\" () only of \"other,\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty and \"truly existing.\" This absolute reality is described by positive terms, an approach which helps \"to overcome certain residual subtle concepts\" and \"the habit [...] of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.\" It destroys false concepts, as does \"prasangika\", but it also alerts the practitioner \"to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.\"\n\nShentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), who identified absolute reality with the Buddha-nature. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAfter this suppression various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. The 19th century saw a revival of Shentong-views, and continued with the Rimé movement. Nowadays Shentong is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the Jonang school, although it is also taught by the Sakya and Kagyu schools, where it is identified with centerless awareness.\n\nThe term \"rangtong\" is not an autonym but rather arose from the shentong theorist Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, who coined the term \"shentong\" to characterise his own teachings and \"rangtong\" to refer to the teachings he opposed.\n\n\"Shentong\" literally means \"other-emptiness\", \"empty\" () of \"other\" (), i.e., empty of all qualities other than its own inherent existent. Yet, the term \"shentong\" also refers to Yogacara teachings, or \"Yogacara Madhyamaka\", which includes the teachings of Śāntarakṣita. In the Gelugpa understanding of the Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction, \"Yogacara Madhyamaka\" is labeled as \"svatantrika\", and set against a strict \"prasaṅgika\" approach which rejects any inherent existence.\n\nAnother translation of \"shentong\" is \"extrinsic emptiness,\" a term which is also used to refer to \"Great Mādhyamaka\" (\"dbu ma chen po\"), a term which has also been used by Klong chen pa and Mipham to refer to Prasaṅgika Madhyamaka, and Tsongkhapa has also used this term.\n\n\"Rangtong\" is the majority Tibetan teaching on the nature of śūnyatā or \"emptiness\", namely that all phenomena are empty of a self-nature in both the relative and absolute sense, without positing anything beyond that. This position is the mainstream Tibetan interpretation of Madhyamaka, especially by the followers of Prasaṅgika Mādhyamaka\n\nTsongkhapa (1357–1419), who also wrote in response to \"shentong\", is the most outspoken defendant of \"rangtong\". He saw emptiness as a consequence of dependent designation, the teaching that no \"thing or phenomenon\" has an existence of its own, but always comes into existence in dependence upon conceptual designation by a conscious mind. (See Designation & \"Conventional Truth\")\n\nTsongkhapa's view on \"ultimate reality\" is condensed in the sort text \"In Praise of Dependent Arising\" c.q. \"In Praise of Relativity\" c.q. \"The Essence of Eloquency\". It states that \"things\" \"do\" exist conventionally, but ultimately everything is dependently arisen, and therefore void of inherent existence:\nThis means that conventionally things \"do\" exist, and that there is no use in denying that. But it also means that ultimately those things have no 'existence of their own', and that cognizing then as such results from cognitive operations, not from some unchangeable essence. Tsongkhapa:\nIt also means that there is no \"transcendental ground,\" and that \"ultimate reality\" has no existence of its own, but is the negation of such a transcendental reality, and the impossibility of any statement on such an ultimately existing transcendental reality: it is no more than a fabrication of the mind. Susan Kahn further explains:\n\"Shentong\" views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is \"empty\" () only of \"other\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty. This absolute reality is the \"ground or substratum\" which is \"uncreated and undestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.\" Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature.\n\nThe shentong-view is related to the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of Śāntarakṣita. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind.\n\nHookham explains the Shentong position, referring to her Kagyu teacher Khenpo Tsultrim's \"Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness\". Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches:\n\nThe notion of \"sentong\" grew out the Tibetan attempts to reconcile the contradiction between the Madhyama stance on the emptiness of phenomena, and the later notion of an eternal Buddha-nature.\n\nThe earliest shentong views are usually asserted to have been presented in a group of treatises variously attributed jointly to Asanga and Maitreyanātha, especially in the treatise known as the \"Unsurpassed Continuum\" (\"Uttaratantraśāstra\", also called the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\"), and in a body of Mādhyamaka treatises attributed to Nāgārjuna (e.g., the \"Dharmadhātustava\", \"In praise of the Dharmadhatu\").\n\nThe first exposition of a shentong view is sometimes attributed to Śāntarakṣita ( 725–788), but most scholars argue that his presentation of Madhyamaka thought is more accurately labeled \"Yogācāra-Svātantrika-Madhyamaka\". The eleventh-century Tibetan master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, a student of the Kashmiri scholar Somanatha, was possibly the first Tibetan master to articulate a shentong view, after his experiences during a Kālacakra retreat.\n\nShentong was systematized and articulated under that name by Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), who originally was Sakya-trained lama, and joined the Jonang school with which \"shentong\" is strongly associated. In 1321 Dolpopa visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time, and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339) about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his shentong method. Dolpopa claimed to have extraordinary insights, and his meditational experience seems to have played a great role in the development of his \"shentong\"-stance. Dolpopa developed a new philosophical vocabulary, based on Sanskrit and Tibetan, to express his insights, presenting provisional statements on absolute reality and Buddha-nature as statements of definitive meaning, which didn't requite further interpretation.\n\nChödrak Gyatso, 7th Karmapa Lama (1454–1506), and the Sakya scholar Sakya Chokden (, 1428–1507) were also important proponents of a shentong view. In the Jonang tradition, Tāranātha [1575–1635] is second in importance only to Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen himself. He was responsible for the short-lived renaissance of the school as a whole in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and of the widespread revitalization of the shentong theory in particular.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Jonang school and its texts and the texts of Sakya Chokden by the Tibetan government in the seventeenth century, various shentong views were propagated mainly by Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas. In particular, the eighth Tai Situpa (1700–1774) and Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755)—Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lamas, respectively, and close colleagues—were very instrumental in reviving shentong among their sects.\n\nAlso instrumental was Situ Panchen (1700–1774), senior court chaplain in the Kingdom of Derge, a student of Katok Tsewang Norbu. \"In the end it would be Situ more than anyone who would create the environment for the widespread acceptance of the Shentong theories in the next century. This revival was continued by Jamgon Kongtrul, a nineteenth-century ecumenical (\"rimé\") scholar and forceful exponent of shentong. shentong views were also advanced recently by the eminent Kagyu Lamas Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.\n\nShentong views have often come under criticism by followers of all four of the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, but particularly by the Gelug. Shentong was suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, equally for political reasons as doctrinal reasons. In 1658, the Gelug authorities banned the Jonang school for political reasons, forcibly converting its monks and monasteries to the Gelug school, as well as banning shentong philosophy and books, thus making the rangtong position the overwhelmingly majority one in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\"Exclusive Rangtongpas\", as the contemporary western Kagyu scholar S.K. Hookham would call them, have claimed that shentong views are inconsistent with the basic Mahāyāna teaching of emptiness, because Shentongpas posit an absolute. They sometimes label \"shentong\" Madhyamaka \"eternalistic Madhyamaka.\"\n\nThe great fourteenth-century Sakya master Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) was very critical of shentong views. Gyaltsab Je and Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama, two of Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa’s primary disciples, were also particularly critical of the shentong views of their time.\n\nAmong Kagyupas and Nyingmapas, the noted nineteenth-century Nyingma lama Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso wrote works both supportive and critical of shentong positions, as did Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama.\n\nAccording to Burchardi, limited attention given in academic studies to the various interpretations of \"gzhan stong\".\n\nThe contemporary western Kagyu scholar Karl Brunnhölzl argues that there is no such thing as \"shentong Madhyamaka,\" but rather that orthodox Yogācāra philosophy (when understood properly) is entirely compatible with Madhyamaka, and therefore shentong is not a novel position. He argues that Yogācāra has often been mischaracterized and unfairly marginalized in Tibetan Buddhist curricula.\n\n\n\n"}

Rumelhart Prize for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition.\n\nStructure-mapping theory aims to improve upon previous theories of analogy, by distinguishing analogy from literal similarity. Previous theories, like Amos Tversky's contrast theory, assumed that an analogy is stronger, the more attributes the base and target have in common. Instead, structure-mapping theory recognizes that there can be differences between base and target domains which make no difference to the strength of the analogy. For example, we can see a battery as being like a reservoir despite them being different in shape, size, colour and substance.\n\nStructure-mapping theory respond by arguing that it is not \"object attributes\" which are mapped in an analogy. Instead the theory contends that an analogy alerts the hearer to a similarity in the \"relationships\" between objects in a domain. The distinction is made in terms of the number of predicates - attributes are predicates with one argument, while relationships are predicates which take two or more arguments. So the proposition \"x is large\" asserts an attribute, while \"x revolves around y\" asserts a relationship. (Higher order predicates assert relationships between propositions)\n\nBy distinguishing attributes and relationships, we can distinguish literal similarities from analogies.\n\nFor example:\n\nAnalogies can also be distinguished from general laws\n\n\nThe distinction in the role of objects, attributes and relationships in the comparison also allows us to characterise a chronology as a comparison in which objects are compared (remain relatively constant), but relationships are not (i.e. are expected to differ).\n\nGentner provides the following table to summarize the different types of domain comparison above:\n\n\"Part of our understanding about analogy is that it conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. Such a system can be represented by an interconnected predicate structure in which higher-order predicates enforce connections among lower-order predicates. reflect this tacit preference for coherence in analogy, I propose the systematicity principle: A predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually interconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into the target than is an isolated predicate.\" (Gentner 1983, p162-163; emphasis added)\n\nThe systematicity principle helps to explain why, when comparing the atom to the solar system, we don't try to map the relative temperature of sun and the earth onto the nucleus-electron system. In short, the temperature has no strong connection to the other object relationships - such as distance, attractive force, relative mass, and relative motion (who revolves around who) - which we do map. What these other relationships share is a strong interdependence - reversing the mass relationship reverses the relative motion relationship, and changing the distance changes the attractive force, and so on.\n\nStructure mapping engine\n"}

At various points between 1973 and 1985 he was held as a Political prisoner in the German Democratic Republic.\n\nKretschmer was born in Dornburg, a small hilltop town some 12 km (7 miles) northeast of Jena. His father was a biologist: his mother was an education specialist. He grew up in a Roman Catholic family and in 1970, at the age of 14 refused to participate in a Jugendweihe, a secular \"coming of age\" ceremony which in the German Democratic Republic had some of the features of a church confirmation. He started a professional trade apprenticeship in 1970, but was excluded from further training or schooling in 1972 after he left the Young Communists (FDJ / \"Freie Deutsche Jugend\") and announced his refusal to undertake military service with the National People's Army: the German Democratic Republic made no accommodation for Conscientious objectors. At the end of a turbulent year he was able to start a new traineeship, as a care assistant at the city hospital in Jena.\n\nIn June 1973 Kretschmer, still aged only 17, attempted to escape from East Germany, \"in order to avoid military service\" (\"um sich dem Wehrdienst zu entziehen\"). Human losses during World War II, exacerbated by a steady stream of migration to the west during the 1950s, had left the country desperately short of working age population, and after 1961 there were effective measures in place to prohibit and prevent emigration. Kretschmer hitchhiked via Dresden to the border with Czechoslovakia which he was able to cross, and continued on his way towards Austria. However, 500 meters short of the border dividing Czechoslovakia from Austria he was caught by Czechoslovak soldiers, blindfolded, placed on the back seat of a jeep like vehicle next to a large dog whose noisy panting and odour he would remember long afterwards, and returned to the German Democratic Republic. The district court in Jena sentenced him to a fifteen-month jail term for attempting illegal emigration. During his incarceration in the he was, understandably, repeatedly interrogated and pressured by officers from the Ministry for State Security. Kretschmer was persuaded to sign a declaration in which he undertook to collaborate with The Ministry. Kretschmer had been identified as a committed Roman Catholic with good contacts among the youth community: he had told his interrogators that he wanted to become a priest. He appears in Stasi records as \"Agent Kaplain\", along with a note by his handler that he was of \"above average intelligence\". Unusually, however, he had a change of heart a few days after his recruitment and wrote to his handler withdrawing the undertaking to collaborate. He was nevertheless released in 1974 at the end of his fifteen-month sentence. The Stasi continued, without success, to try and persuade him to collaborate with them.\n\nFrom 1974 Thomas Kretschmer engaged actively in in Jena. Between 1974 and 1976 he worked as a care assistant at the city hospital in Jena, and in a residential institution for the handicapped at the nearby health resort of Bad Blankenburg, while also remaining active in the local \"alternative youth scene\". In 1976 he began to study for the priesthood at the Erfurt . He then married and relocated to nearby Apfelstädt. In 1980 he was prevented from undertaking further studies for the priesthood by the in Thuringia. Other sources state that he had already, in 1979, withdrawn for personal reasons. In either case, in November 1980 he again found himself summoned to perform his military service and, when he refused the call, arrested. In December 1980 his conscription was conditionally suspended and he was instead called up to serve as a Construction soldier (\"\"Bausoldat\").\n\nThe new Construction soldier (\"Bausoldat\"\") system provided the state with a solution to the challenge presented by Conscientious objection, but it also offered a de facto finishing school for principled activists and pacifists. Kretschmer developed an affinity with the Solidarity Movement in neighbouring Poland, and demonstrated his support at the start of 1982 with a New Year's Batik which he designed, created, and distributed to his friends. It displayed the brief but, in the context of the times, politically powerful injunction, \"Learn Polish!\" (\"Lernt polnisch!\"). His seasonal greeting was intercepted by the censors and he was arrested in January 1982, spending the next six months being looked after by the Ministry for State Security at their Main Interrogation Centre in Berlin.\n\nIn August 1982 a military high court in Halle condemned Kretschmer under sections §214, §245 and §246 of the criminal code for \"activity affecting the state\" and \"public disrespect\". He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, some of which he would spend in the country's only military prison, at Schwendt. Later it became known that Thomas Kretschmer's defence attorney for this trial was a Stasi collaborator who had been providing reports on his client to the Ministry. At the time of Kretschmer's imprisonment in the his wife and four young children were unprovided for. He was one of several inmates at the establishment who came to the attention of the international London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International: they sent his wife an hundred British pounds for the family's basic living costs.\n\nIn January 1985 Kretschmer was transferred to the Stasi detention centre at Karl-Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was then called) in preparation for his release to West Germany. Kretschmer refused to go to West Germany. His case was taken up by Archbishop Kurt Scharf, Bishop Werner Leich, and by church organisations more generally, along with Amnesty International who nominated him their \"prisoner of the year\". In July 1985 Kretschmer, who had by this time been transferred to Leipzig, was released. He now worked, till 1989, as a church manual craftsman in .\n\nThe breach by protestors of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, and the ensuing evidence that the Soviet leadership had issued no orders to the military for the violent suppression of the burgeoning revolution opened the way for a succession of events that would lead to the demise, as a standalone one-party dictatorship, of the German Democratic Republic and, in October 1990, German reunification. In regional Stasi establishments across the country one feature of the revolutionary phase was a desperate scramble to destroy the paper records that the ministry officers had assiduously and meticulously built up and safeguarded during nearly four decades. Protestors rushed across the country to prevent the destruction of the Stasi records, with varying degrees of success. Thomas Kretsschmer participated in the occupation of the Stasi regional office at the ;little town of Bad Lobenstein and he was a member of the Thuringian Citizens' Committee for Resolving Stasi issues (\"thüringischen Bürgerkomitee zur Auflösung des MfS\"). He participated in local politics as a member of the Lobenstein \"Ecclesiastical Electorate Community\" (\"Kirchliche Wählergemeinschaft\").\n\nToday (2015) Krestschmer lives quietly as a wood carver in Tegau. He also worked from 2001 in a specialist clinic in Stadtroda with physically handicapped patients.\n\nIn 2014 his civil resistance record was honoured in a BStU exhibition at the Heinrich Böll Foundation.\n"}
{"id": "37080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37080", "title": "Thought", "text": "Thought\n\nThought encompasses an “aim-free flow of ideas and associations that can lead to a reality-oriented conclusion.” Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is no consensus as to how it is defined or understood.\n\nBecause thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins, processes, and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including philosophy, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, sociology and\ncognitive science.\n\nThinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or model the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.\n\nThe word \"thought\" comes from Old English \"þoht\", or \"geþoht\", from stem of \"þencan\" \"to conceive of in the mind, consider\".\n\nThe word \"thought\" may mean:\n\n\nDefinitions may or may not require that thought\n\nDefinitions of thought may also be derived directly or indirectly from theories of thought.\n\n\nThe phenomenology movement in philosophy saw a radical change in the way in which we understand thought. Martin Heidegger's phenomenological analyses of the existential structure of man in \"Being and Time\" cast new light on the issue of thinking, unsettling traditional cognitive or rational interpretations of man which affect the way we understand thought. The notion of the fundamental role of non-cognitive understanding in rendering possible thematic consciousness informed the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPhenomenology, however, is not the only approach to thinking in modern Western philosophy. Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind–body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body. \n\nThe mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes. The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.\n\nHuman perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at one's various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one's mental state, ultimately causing one to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's propositional attitudes (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of René Descartes.\n\nThe above reflects a classical, functional description of how we work as cognitive, thinking systems. However the apparently irresolvable mind–body problem is said to be overcome, and bypassed, by the embodied cognition approach, with its roots in the work of Heidegger, Piaget, Vygotsky, Merleau-Ponty and the pragmatist John Dewey.\n\nThis approach states that the classical approach of separating the mind and analysing its processes is misguided: instead, we should see that the mind, actions of an embodied agent, and the environment it perceives and envisions, are all parts of a whole which determine each other. Therefore, functional analysis of the mind alone will always leave us with the mind–body problem which cannot be solved.\n\nA neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable cell in the nervous system that processes and transmits information by electrochemical signaling. Neurons are the core components of the brain, the vertebrate spinal cord, the invertebrate ventral nerve cord and the peripheral nerves. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the sensory organs that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord that cause muscle contractions and affect glands. Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons respond to stimuli, and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system, which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action. Neurons do not go through mitosis and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed, although astrocytes have been observed to turn into neurons, as they are sometimes pluripotent.\n\nPsychologists have concentrated on thinking as an intellectual exertion aimed at finding an answer to a question or the solution of a practical problem. Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. The school of thought arising from this approach is known as cognitivism, which is interested in how people mentally represent information processing. It had its foundations in the Gestalt psychology of Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka, and in the work of Jean Piaget, who provided a theory of stages/phases that describes children's cognitive development.\n\nCognitive psychologists use psychophysical and experimental approaches to understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response. They study various aspects of thinking, including the psychology of reasoning, and how people make decisions and choices, solve problems, as well as engage in creative discovery and imaginative thought. Cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems either take the form of algorithms: rules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution, or of heuristics: rules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions. Cognitive science differs from cognitive psychology in that algorithms that are intended to simulate human behavior are implemented or implementable on a computer. In other instances, solutions may be found through insight, a sudden awareness of relationships.\n\nIn developmental psychology, Jean Piaget was a pioneer in the study of the development of thought from birth to maturity. In his theory of cognitive development, thought is based on actions on the environment. That is, Piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands. As a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation, thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding. That is, thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the sensorimotor stage in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood. Subsequently, representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality, in the stage of concrete operations, and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties, in the stage of formal operations. In recent years, the Piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions. Thus, thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information. In this conception, speed of processing, cognitive control, and working memory are the main functions underlying thought. In the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development, the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing, enhanced cognitive control, and increasing working memory.\n\nPositive psychology emphasizes the positive aspects of human psychology as equally important as the focus on mood disorders and other negative symptoms. In \"Character Strengths and Virtues\", Peterson and Seligman list a series of positive characteristics. One person is not expected to have every strength, nor are they meant to fully capsulate that characteristic entirely. The list encourages positive thought that builds on a person's strengths, rather than how to \"fix\" their \"symptoms\".\n\nThe \"id\", \"ego\" and \"super-ego\" are the three parts of the \"psychic apparatus\" defined in Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model, the uncoordinated instinctual trends are encompassed by the \"id\", the organized realistic part of the psyche is the \"ego\", and the critical, moralizing function is the \"super-ego\".\n\nThe unconscious was considered by Freud throughout the evolution of his psychoanalytic theory to be a sentient force of will influenced by human desire and yet operating well below the perceptual conscious mind. For Freud, the unconscious is the storehouse of instinctual desires, needs and psychic drives. While past thoughts and reminiscences may be concealed from immediate consciousness, they direct the thoughts and feelings of the individual from the realm of the unconscious.\n\nFor psychoanalysis, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, rather only what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what the person is averse to knowing consciously. In a sense this view places the self in relationship to their unconscious as an adversary, warring with itself to keep what is unconscious hidden. If a person feels pain, all he can think of is alleviating the pain. Any of his desires, to get rid of pain or enjoy something, command the mind what to do. For Freud, the unconscious was a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of psychological repression. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the symptom.\n\nSocial psychology is the study of how people and groups interact. Scholars in this interdisciplinary area are typically either psychologists or sociologists, though all social psychologists employ both the individual and the group as their units of analysis.\n\nDespite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate academic journals and professional societies. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following World War II. Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.\n\nThe collective unconscious, sometimes known as collective subconscious, is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is a part of the unconscious mind, shared by a society, a people, or all humanity, in an interconnected system that is the product of all common experiences and contains such concepts as science, religion, and morality. While Freud did not distinguish between an \"individual psychology\" and a \"collective psychology\", Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal subconscious particular to each human being. The collective unconscious is also known as \"a reservoir of the experiences of our species\".\n\nIn the \"Definitions\" chapter of Jung's seminal work \"Psychological Types\", under the definition of \"collective\" Jung references \"representations collectives\", a term coined by Lucien Lévy-Bruhl in his 1910 book \"How Natives Think\". Jung says this is what he describes as the collective unconscious. Freud, on the other hand, did not accept the idea of a collective unconscious.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "390562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390562", "title": "Tomasulo algorithm", "text": "Tomasulo algorithm\n\nTomasulo’s algorithm is a computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows out-of-order execution and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units. It was developed by Robert Tomasulo at IBM in 1967 and was first implemented in the IBM System/360 Model 91’s floating point unit.\n\nThe major innovations of Tomasulo’s algorithm include register renaming in hardware, reservation stations for all execution units, and a common data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved parallel execution of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of scoreboarding or other earlier algorithms.\n\nRobert Tomasulo received the Eckert–Mauchly Award in 1997 for his work on the algorithm.\n\nThe following are the concepts necessary to the implementation of Tomasulo's Algorithm:\n\nThe Common Data Bus (CDB) connects reservation stations directly to functional units. According to Tomasulo it \"preserves precedence while encouraging concurrency\". This has two important effects:\n\nInstructions are issued sequentially so that the effects of a sequence of instructions, such as exceptions raised by these instructions, occur in the same order as they would on an in-order processor, regardless of the fact that they are being executed out-of-order (i.e. non-sequentially). \n\nTomasulo's Algorithm uses register renaming to correctly perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a placeholder value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a placeholder value is initially used. The placeholder value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the placeholder will be replaced with the real value.\n\nEach functional unit has a single reservation station. Reservation stations hold information needed to execute a single instruction, including the operation and the operands. The functional unit begins processing when it is free and when all source operands needed for an instruction are real.\n\nPractically speaking, there may be exceptions for which not enough status information about an exception is available, in which case the processor may raise a special exception, called an \"imprecise\" exception. Imprecise exceptions cannot occur in non-OoOE implementations, as processor state is changed only in program order (see RISC Pipeline Exceptions).\n\nPrograms that experience \"precise\" exceptions, where the specific instruction that took the exception can be determined, can restart or re-execute at the point of the exception. However, those that experience \"imprecise\" exceptions generally cannot restart or re-execute, as the system cannot determine the specific instruction that took the exception.\n\nThe three stages listed below are the stages through which each instruction passes from the time it is issued to the time its execution is complete.\n\n\nIn the issue stage, instructions are issued for execution if all operands and reservation stations are ready or else they are stalled. Registers are renamed in this step, eliminating WAR and WAW hazards.\n\n\nIn the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory.\n\n\nIn the write Result stage, ALU operations results are written back to registers and store operations are written back to memory.\n\nThe concepts of reservation stations, register renaming, and the common data bus in Tomasulo's algorithm presents significant advancements in the design of high-performance computers.\n\nReservation stations take on the responsibility of waiting for operands in the presence of data dependencies and other inconsistencies such as varying storage access time and circuit speeds, thus freeing up the functional units. This improvement overcomes long floating point delays and memory accesses. In particular the algorithm is more tolerant of cache misses. Additionally, programmers are freed from implementing optimized code. This is a result of the common data bus and reservation station working together to preserve dependencies as well as encouraging concurrency.\n\nBy tracking operands for instructions in the reservation stations and register renaming in hardware the algorithm minimizes read-after-write (RAW) and eliminates write-after-write (WAW) and Write-after-Read (WAR) computer architecture hazards. This improves performance by reducing wasted time that would otherwise be required for stalls.\n\nAn equally important improvement in the algorithm is the design is not limited to a specific pipeline structure. This improvement allows the algorithm to be more widely adopted by multiple-issue processors. Additionally, the algorithm is easily extended to enable branch speculation. \n\nTomasulo's algorithm, outside of IBM, was unused for several years after its implementation in the System/360 Model 91 architecture. However, it saw a vast increase in usage during the 1990s for 3 reasons:\n\nMany modern processors implement dynamic scheduling schemes that are derivative of Tomasulo’s original algorithm, including popular Intel x86-64 chips.\n\n\n"}

They were initially developed in France by Jean-Dominique Warnier and in the United States by Kenneth Orr. This method aids the design of program structures by identifying the output and processing results and then working backwards to determine the steps and combinations of input needed to produce them. The simple graphic method used in Warnier/Orr diagrams makes the levels in the system evident and the movement of the data between them vivid.\n\nWarnier/Orr diagrams show the processes and sequences in which they are performed. Each process is defined in a hierarchical manner i.e. it consists of sets of subprocesses, that define it. At each level, the process is shown in bracket that groups its components.\n\nSince a process can have many different subprocesses, Warnier/Orr diagram uses a set of brackets to show each level of the system. Critical factors in s/w definition and development are iteration or repetition and alternation. Warnier/Orr diagrams show this very well.\n\nTo develop a Warnier/Orr diagram, the analyst works backwards, starting with systems output and using output oriented analysis. On paper, the development moves from the set to the element (from left to right) . First, the intended output or results of the processing are defined. At the next level, shown by inclusion with a bracket, the steps needed to produce the output are defined. Each step in turn is further defined. Additional brackets group the processes required to produce the result on the next level.\n\nWarnier/Orr diagrams offer some distinct advantages to systems experts. They are simple in appearance and easy to understand. Yet they are powerful design tools. They have advantage of showing groupings of processes and the data that must be passed from level to level. In addition, the sequence of working backwards ensures that the system will be result oriented. This method is useful for both data and process definition. It can be used for each independently, or both can be combined on the same diagram.\n\nThere are four basic constructs used on Warnier/Orr diagrams: hierarchy, sequence, repetition, and alternation. There are also two slightly more advanced concepts that are occasionally needed: concurrency and recursion.\n\nHierarchy is the most fundamental of all of the Warnier/Orr constructs. It is simply a nested group of sets and subsets shown as a set of nested brackets. Each bracket on the diagram (depending on how you represent it, the character is usually more like a brace \"{\" than a bracket \"[\", but we call them \"brackets\") represents one level of hierarchy. The hierarchy or structure that is represented on the diagram can show the organization of data or processing. However, both data and processing are never shown on the same diagram.\n\nSequence is the simplest structure to show on a Warnier/Orr diagram. Within one level of hierarchy, the features listed are shown in the order in which they occur. In other words, the step listed first is the first that will be executed (if the diagram reflects a process), while the step listed last is the last that will be executed. Similarly with data, the data field listed first is the first that is encountered when looking at the data, the data field listed last is the final one encountered.\n\nRepetition is the representation of a classic \"loop\" in programming terms. It occurs whenever the same set of data occurs over and over again (for a data structure) or whenever the same group of actions is to occur over and over again (for a processing structure). Repetition is indicated by placing a set of numbers inside parentheses beneath the repeating set.\n\nTypically there are two numbers listed in the parentheses, representing the fewest and the most number of times the set will repeat. By convention the first letter of the repeating set is the letter chosen to represent the maximum.\n\nWhile the minimum bound and maximum bound can technically be anything, they are most often either \"(1,n)\" as in the example, or \"(0,n).\" When used to depict processing, the \"(1,n)\" repetition is classically known as a \"DoUntil\" loop, while the \"(0,n)\" repetition is called a \"DoWhile\" loop. On the Warnier/Orr diagram, however, there is no distinction between the two different types of repetition, other than the minimum bound value.\n\nOn occasion, the minimum and maximum bound are predefined and not likely to change: for instance the set \"Day\" occurs within the set \"Month\" from 28 to 31 times (since the smallest month has 28 days, the largest months, 31). This is not likely to change. And on occasion, the minimum and maximum are fixed at the same number.\n\nIn general, though, it is a bad idea to \"hard code\" a constant other than \"0\" or \"1\" in a number of times clause—the design should be flexible enough to allow for changes in the number of times without changes to the design. For instance, if a company has 38 employees at the time a design is done, hard coding a \"38\" as the \"number of employees\" within company would certainly not be as flexible as designing \"(1,n)\".\n\nThe number of times clause is always an operator attached to some set (i.e., the name of some bracket), and is never attached to an element (a diagram feature which does not decompose into smaller features). The reason for this will become more apparent as we continue to work with the diagrams. For now, you will have to accept this as a formation rule for a correct diagram.\n\nAlternation, or selection, is the traditional \"decision\" process whereby a determination is made to execute one process or another. The Exclusive OR symbol (the plus sign inside the circle) indicates that the sets immediately above and below it are mutually exclusive (if one is present the other is not). This diagram indicates that an Employee is either Management or Non-Management, one Employee cannot be both. It is also permissible to use a \"negation bar\" above an alternative in a manner similar to engineering notation. The bar is read by simply using the word \"not\".\n\nAlternatives do not have to be binary as in the previous examples, but may be many-way alternatives.\n\nConcurrency is one of the two advanced constructs used in the methodology. It is used whenever sequence is unimportant. For instance, years and weeks operate concurrently (or at the same time) within our calendar. The concurrency operator is rarely used in program design (since most languages do not support true concurrent processing anyway), but does come into play when resolving logical and physical data structure clashes.\n\nRecursion is the least used of the constructs. It is used to indicate that a set contains an earlier or a less ordered version of itself. In the classic \"bill of materials\" problem components contain parts and other sub-components. Sub-components also contain sub-sub-components, and so on. The doubled bracket indicates that the set is recursive. Data structures that are truly recursive are rather rare.\n\n\n"}
