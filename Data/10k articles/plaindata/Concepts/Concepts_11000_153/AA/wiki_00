{"id": "649735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=649735", "title": "Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse", "text": "Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse\n\nDuring the war in Iraq that began in March 2003, personnel of the United States Army and the Central Intelligence Agency committed a series of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These violations included physical and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder. The abuses came to widespread public attention with the publication of photographs of the abuse by CBS News in April 2004. The incidents received widespread condemnation both within the United States and abroad, although the soldiers received support from some conservative media within the United States.\n\nThe administration of George W. Bush asserted that these were isolated incidents, not indicative of general U.S. policy. This was disputed by humanitarian organizations such as the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch. These organizations stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents, but were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Several scholars stated that the abuses constituted state-sanctioned crimes.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense removed seventeen soldiers and officers from duty, and eleven soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004, and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It was reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to their being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nDocuments popularly known as the Torture Memos came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States Department of Justice, authorized certain enhanced interrogation techniques, generally held to involve torture of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that international humanitarian laws, such as the Geneva Conventions, did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006), have overturned Bush administration policy, and ruled that Geneva Conventions apply.\n\nMany of the torture techniques used were developed at Guant√°namo detention center, including prolonged isolation; the frequent flier program, a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they couldn't sleep for days, weeks, even months, short-shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise and preying on phobias.\n\nThe September 11 attacks in the United States led to demands from the public that U.S. president George W. Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks. This pressure led to the launch of the War on Terror. The fact that the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and the perceived threat of extreme strategies including suicide bombing, led to a pressure on the Bush administration to act decisively. In addition, these tactics created the perception that the \"legitimate\" techniques used in the cold war would not be of much use. US vice-president Dick Cheney stated, for example, that the US \"[had] to work sort of on the dark side\", and that it had to \"use any means at [its] disposal\".\n\nThe Iraq War began in March 2003 as an invasion of Ba'athist Iraq by a force led by the United States. The Ba'athist government led by Saddam Hussein was toppled within a month. This conflict was followed by a longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an occupying power.\n\nThe Abu Ghraib prison in the town of Abu Ghraib was one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq during the government of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent. The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of Baghdad. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military. In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.\n\nThree categories of prisoners were imprisoned at Abu Ghraib by the U.S. military. These were \"common criminals,\" individuals suspected of being leaders of the insurgency, and individuals suspected of committing crimes against the occupational force led by the U.S. Although most prisoners lived in tents in the yard, the abuses took place inside cell blocks 1a and 1b. The 800th Military Police Brigade, from Uniondale, New York, was responsible for running the prison. The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who was in charge of all of the U.S. run prisons in Iraq. She did not have previous experience in running a prison. The individuals who committed abuses at the prison were members of the 372nd Military Police Company, which was a constituent of the 320th Military Police Battalion, which was overseen by Karpinski's Brigade headquarters.\n\nThe Fay Report noted that \"contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison\". Over half the interrogators working at the prison were employees of CACI International, while Titan Corporation supplied linguistics personnel. In his report, General Fay notes that \"The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib...\"\n\nIn June 2003, Amnesty International published reports of human rights abuse by the U.S. military and its coalition partners at detention centers and prisons in Iraq. These included reports of brutal treatment at Abu Ghraib prison, which had once been used by the government of Saddam Hussein, and had been taken over by the United States after the invasion. On June 20, 2003, Abdel Salam Sidahmed, Deputy Director of AI's Middle East Program, described an uprising by the prisoners against the conditions of their detention, saying \"The notorious Abu Ghraib Prison, centre of torture and mass executions under Saddam Hussein, is yet again a prison cut off from the outside world. On 13 June there was a protest in this prison against indefinite detention without trial. Troops from the occupying powers killed one person and wounded seven.\"\n\nOn July 23, 2003, Amnesty International issued a press release condemning widespread human rights abuses by U.S. and coalition forces. The release stated that prisoners had been exposed to extreme heat, not provided clothing, and forced to use open trenches for toilets. They had also been tortured, with the methods including denial of sleep for extended periods, exposure to bright lights and loud music, and being restrained in uncomfortable positions.\n\nOn November 1, 2003, the Associated Press presented a special report on the massive human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. Their report began; \"In Iraq's American detention camps, forbidden talk can earn a prisoner hours bound and stretched out in the sun, and detainees swinging tent poles rise up regularly against their jailers, according to recently released Iraqis.\" The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners at the hands of their American captors: \"'They confined us like sheep,' the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. 'They hit people. They humiliated people.'\" In response, U.S. Brigadier-General Janis Karpinski, at the time in charge of all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated \"humanely and fairly.\" The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel, one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, the other about the death of a prisoner in custody.\n\nSince the beginning of the invasion, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had been allowed to oversee the prison, and submitted reports about the treatment of the prisoners. In response to an ICRC report, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, who oversaw all US detention facilities in Iraq, stated that several of the prisoners were intelligence assets, and therefore not entitled to complete protection under the Geneva Convention. The ICRC reports led to Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of the Iraqi task force, appointing Major General Antonio Taguba to investigate the allegations on 1 January 2004. Taguba submitted his findings (the Taguba Report) in February 2004, stating that \"numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees. This systemic and illegal abuse of detainees was intentionally perpetrated by several members of the military police guard force.\" The report stated that there was widespread evidence of this abuse, including photographic evidence. The report was not released publicly. The abuse was also perpetrated by three female military officers shown in the images on this page, where they received a wide range of attention and were convicted later on along with other several members. \n\nThe scandal came to widespread public attention In April 2004, when a \"60 Minutes II\" news report was aired on April 28 by CBS News, describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel taunting naked prisoners. An article was published by Seymour M. Hersh in \"The New Yorker\" magazine (posted online on April 30 and published days later in the May 10 issue), which also had a widespread impact. The photographs were subsequently reproduced in the press across the world. The details of the Taguba report were made public in May 2004. Shortly afterwards, U.S. President George W. Bush stated that the individuals responsible would be \"brought to justice,\" while United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan said that the effort to reconstruct a government in Iraq had been badly damaged.\n\nOn December 21, 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union released copies of internal memoranda from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in Guantanamo Bay, Afghanistan, and Iraq. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the \"On Scene Commander ‚Äì Baghdad,\" but whose name had been redacted. This individual referred explicitly to an Executive Order that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, hooding prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called \"stress positions\", and the use of dogs. The author also stated that the Pentagon had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the chain of command. The author identifies \"physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching\" as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated by the president of the United States.\n\nDocuments obtained by \"The Washington Post\" and the ACLU showed that Ricardo Sanchez, who was a Lieutenant General and the senior U.S. military officer in Iraq, authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns, and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib. A November 2004 report by Brigadier General Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison had been following orders based on a memorandum from Sanchez, and that the abuse had not been carried out by isolated \"criminal\" elements. ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement from the union that \"General Sanchez authorized interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army's own standards.\"\nIn an interview for her hometown newspaper \"The Signal\", Karpinski stated that she had seen unreleased documents from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld which authorized the use of these tactics on Iraqi prisoners.\n\nA 2004 report by the \"New Yorker\" stated that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had authorized the interrogation tactics used in Abu Ghraib, and which had previously been used by the US in Afghanistan. In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's \"El Pa√≠s\" newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation. \"The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.\" According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name, and the comment \"Make sure this is accomplished\" was in the margin in the same hand-writing. Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques that he knew to be illegal under international law.\n\nManadel al-Jamadi, a prisoner at Abu Ghraib prison, died after a CIA officer Mark Swanner and a private contractor (\"identified in military-court papers only as 'Clint C.'\") interrogated and tortured him in November 2003. The torture included physical violence and strappado hanging, wherein the victim is hung from the wrists with their hands tied behind their back. Although the US military labeled the death a homicide, neither of the two men who caused his death were charged. The private contractor was granted qualified immunity.\n\nIn 2004, Antonio Taguba, a major general in the U.S. Army, wrote in the Taguba Report that a detainee had been sodomized with \"a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick.\" In 2009, Taguba stated that there was photographic evidence of rape having occurred at Abu Ghraib. An Abu Ghraib detainee told investigators that he heard an Iraqi teenage boy screaming, and saw an Army translator raping him, while a female soldier took pictures. A witness identified the alleged rapist as an American-Egyptian who worked as a translator. In 2009, he was the subject of a civil court case in the United States. Another photo shows an American soldier apparently raping a female prisoner. Other photos show interrogators sexually assaulting prisoners with objects including a truncheon, wire and a phosphorescent tube, and a female prisoner having her clothing forcibly removed to expose her breasts. Taguba supported United States President Barack Obama's decision not to release the photos, stating, \"These pictures show torture, abuse, rape and every indecency.\" Obama, who initially agreed to release the photographs, changed his mind after lobbying from senior military figures, saying their release could put troops in danger and \"inflame anti-American public opinion\".\n\nIn other instances of sexual abuse, soldiers were found to have raped female inmates, and senior U.S. officials admitted that rape had taken place at Abu Ghraib. Some of the women who had been raped became pregnant, and in some cases, were later killed by their family members in what were thought to be instances of honor killing. In addition, children were raped by prison staff in front of watching women.\n\nIn May 2004, the \"Washington Post\" reported evidence given by Ameen Saeed Al-Sheik, detainee No. 151362. It quoted him as saying; \"They said we will make you wish to die and it will not happen [...] They stripped me naked. One of them told me he would rape me. He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks.\" \"'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, '[Expletive] you. And [expletive] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health[y], you are getting out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.' \" [...] \"They ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive.\" [...] \"I said to him, 'I believe in Allah.' So he said, 'But I believe in torture and I will torture you.'\"\n\nOn January 12, 2005, \"The New York Times\" reported on further testimony from Abu Ghraib detainees. The abuses reported included urinating on detainees, pounding wounded limbs with metal batons, pouring phosphoric acid on detainees, and tying ropes to the detainees' legs or penises and dragging them across the floor.\n\nIn her video diary, a prison guard said that prisoners were shot for minor misbehavior, and claimed to have had venomous snakes used to bite prisoners, sometimes resulting in their deaths. The guard said that she was \"in trouble\" for having thrown rocks at the detainees. Hashem Muhsen, one of the naked prisoners in the human pyramid photo, later said the men were also forced to crawl around the floor naked while soldiers rode them like donkeys.\n\nOn May 7, 2004, Pierre Kr√§henb√ºhl, Operations Director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), stated that inspection visits made by the ICRC to detention centers run by the U.S. and its allies showed that acts of prisoner abuse were not isolated acts, but were part of a \"pattern and a broad system.\" He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were \"tantamount to torture\".\n\nArmed forces in the U.S. and the UK are jointly trained in techniques known as \"resistance to interrogation (R2I)\" techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with, or resist, torture if they are captured. On May 8, 2004, \"The Guardian\" reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the Abu Ghraib prison military personnel resembled the techniques used in R2I training.\n\nThe same report stated that:\nHistorian Alfred W. McCoy, who authored a book on torture in the Philippines armed forces, noted similarities in the abusive treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the techniques described in the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation manual published by the United States Central Intelligence Agency in 1963. He asserts that what he calls \"the CIA's no-touch torture methods\" have been in continuous use by the CIA and the U.S. military intelligence since that time.\n\nOn November 1, 2003, the Associated Press published a lengthy report on inhumane treatment, beatings, and deaths at Abu Ghraib and other American prisons in Iraq. This report was based on interviews with released detainees, who told journalist Charles J. Hanley that inmates had been attacked by dogs, made to wear hoods, and humiliated in other ways. The article gained little notice. One freed detainee said that he wished somebody would publish pictures of what was happening.\n\nWhen the U.S. military first acknowledged the abuse in early 2004, much of the United States media once again showed little initial interest. On January 16, 2004, the United States Central Command informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and humiliation of Iraqi detainees by a group of U.S. soldiers. On February 24, it was reported that 17 soldiers had been suspended. The military announced on March 21, 2004, that the first charges had been filed against six soldiers. None of these stories received significant coverage in the mainstream press.\n\nIn late April 2004, the U.S. television news-magazine \"60 Minutes II\", a franchise of CBS, broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners. The news segment was delayed by two weeks at the request of the Department of Defense and Richard Myers, an air force general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After learning that \"The New Yorker\" magazine planned to publish an article and photographs on the topic in its next issue, CBS proceeded to broadcast its report on April 28. In the CBS report, Dan Rather interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq, Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, who said:\n\nKimmitt also acknowledged that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq. Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: \"We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage.\" In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, who was party to some of the abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, \"We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening.\" Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: \"The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [intravenous drip] in his arm and took him away. This [CIA prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number.\" Frederick implicated the Military Intelligence Corps as well, saying \"MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [and] that they were now getting positive results and information.\"\n\nIn 2004, Seymour M. Hersh published an article in \"The New Yorker\" magazine discussing the abuses in detail, and used as its source a copy of the Taguba report. Under the direction of editor David Remnick, the magazine also posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards. The article, entitled \"Torture at Abu Ghraib\", was followed in the next two weeks by two further articles on the same subject, \"Chain of Command\" and \"The Gray Zone\", also by Hersh.\n\nIn February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by SBS, an Australian television network, on its \"Dateline\" program. The Bush administration attempted to prevent release of the images in the U.S., arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism. These newly released photographs depicted prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also showed prisoners killed by the soldiers, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a \"pet\" for torture. The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately, but the Pentagon stated that the images \"have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation.\"\n\nOn March 15, 2006, Salon published what was then the most extensive documentation of the abuse. A report accessed by Salon included the following summary of the material: \"A review of all the computer media submitted to this office revealed a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts.\"\n\nThe news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi scholar at the London School of Economics, as saying: \"The reception [of the news about Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point.\" CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was \"mixed\": \"Some people react[ed] positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they‚Äîmany people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from‚Äîit's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners.\"\n\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal, who held several command positions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said that, \"In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him into action.\" He also said that, \"mistreating detainees would discredit us. ... The pictures [from] Abu Ghraib represented a setback for America's efforts in Iraq. Simultaneously undermining U.S. domestic confidence in the way in which America was operating, and creating or reinforcing negative perceptions worldwide of American values, it fueled violence\".\n\nOn May 7, 2004 Nick Berg, an American businessman who went to Iraq after the US Invasion, was captured and decapitated by the Islamist militant organization al-Ansars in response to Abu Ghraib. The masked man who carried out the execution is believed to have been Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\nThe Bush administration did not initially acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq. Bush described the abuses as the actions of a few individuals, who were disregarding the values of the US. This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the International Red Cross had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year before the scandal broke. Scholars studying the abuses have stated that the abuses were part of a widespread pattern. Vice-president Dick Cheney's office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials. On May 7, 2004, United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\nHe also commented on the very existence of the evidence of abuse:\nRumsfeld was careful to draw a distinction between abuse and torture: \"What has been charged so far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture. I'm not going to address the 'torture' word.\"\n\nSeveral senators commented on Rumsfeld's testimony. Lindsey Graham stated that \"the American public needs to understand we're talking about rape and murder here.\" Norm Coleman said that \"It was pretty disgusting, not what you'd expect from Americans\". Ben Nighthorse Campbell said \"I don't know how the hell these people got into our army\".\n\nJames Inhofe, a Republican member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, stated that the events were being blown out of proportion: \"I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment [...] [They] are not there for traffic violations. [...] these prisoners‚Äîthey're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. [...] Many of them probably have American blood on their hands. And here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals.\"\n\nOn May 26, 2004, Al Gore gave a sharply critical speech on the scandal and the Iraq War. He called for the resignations of Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, CIA Director George Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith, and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone, for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad. Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan \"incompetent\" and described Bush as the most dishonest president since Richard Nixon. Gore commented; \"In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy.\" Rumsfeld was also criticized by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, including Senators John Kerry, and Joe Biden, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe revelations were also the impetus for the creation of the Fay Report, named for its lead author George Fay, as well as the Taguba Report.\n\nSeveral periodicals, including \"The New York Times\" and \"The Boston Globe\", called for Rumsfeld's resignation. The cover of \"The Economist\", which had backed President Bush in the 2000 election, carried a photo of the abuse with the words \"Resign, Rumsfeld.\"\n\nRight-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh contended that the events were being blown out of proportion, stating that \"this is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release? You ever heard of emotional release?\" Conservative talk show host Michael Savage said, \"Instead of putting joysticks, I would have liked to have seen dynamite put in their orifices\", and that \"we need more of the humiliation tactics, not less.\" He repeatedly referred to Abu Ghraib prison as \"Grab-an-Arab\" prison.\n\nThe Bahraini English-language newspaper \"Daily Tribune\" wrote on May 5, 2004, that \"The blood-boiling pictures will make more people inside and outside Iraq determined to carry out attacks against the Americans and British.\" The Qatari Arabic-language \"Al-Watan\" predicted on May 3, 2004 that due to the abuse, \"The Iraqis now feel very angry and that will cause revenge to restore the humiliated dignity.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2004, swastika-covered posters of Abu Ghraib abuse photographs were attached to British and Indian graves at the Commonwealth military cemetery in Gaza City. Thirty-two graves of soldiers killed in World War I were desecrated or destroyed. In November 2008, Lord Bingham, the former UK Law Lord, describing the treatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib, said: \"Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration.\"\n\nEleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the incidents, with all of the convictions including the charge of dereliction of duty. Most soldiers only received minor sentences. Three other soldiers were either cleared of charges or were not charged. No one was convicted for the murders of the detainees.\n\n\n\nThe Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review Department of Defense detention operations specifically absolved U.S. military and political leadership from culpability: \"The Panel finds no evidence that organizations above the 800th MP brigade or the 205th MI Brigade-level were directly involved in the incidents at Abu Ghraib.\"\n\nThe United States has ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture and the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. The Bush Administration took the position that: \"Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the 'liberation of Iraq'\".\nThe Convention Against Torture defines torture in the following terms:\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch:\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces (CF) that it had documented \nThere were several major violations described in the ICRC report. These included brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury; absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families; physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information; prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight; excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.\n\nSome legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for war crimes. Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a \"grave breach\". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.\n\nIn December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military's practice of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, \"All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country.\"\n\nAlberto Gonzales and other senior administration lawyers argued that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and other similar prisons should be considered \"unlawful combatants\" and were not protected by the Geneva Conventions. These opinions were issued in multiple memoranda, known today as the \"Torture Memos,\" in August 2002, by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the U.S. Justice Department. They were written by John Yoo, deputy assistant attorney-general in the OLC, and two of three were signed by his boss Jay S. Bybee. (The latter was appointed as a federal judge in 2003, starting March 21, 2003.) An additional memo was issued on March 14, 2003, after the resignation of Bybee, and just prior to the American invasion of Iraq. In it, Yoo concluded that federal laws prohibiting the use of torture did not apply to U.S. practices overseas. Gonzales observed that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions, \"substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the War Crimes Act.\" Congressman Elizabeth Holtzman wrote that Gonzales's statement suggested that policy was crafted to ensure that the actions of U.S. officials could not be considered war crimes.\n\nIn \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006), the US Supreme Court ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applied to all detainees in the War on Terror. It said that the military tribunals used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It said that the president could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals of lawsuits from a group of 250 Iraqis who wanted to sue CACI International Inc. and Titan Corp. (now a subsidiary of L-3 Communications), the two private contractors at Abu Ghraib, over claims of abuse by interrogators and translators at the prison. The suits had been dismissed by the lower courts on the grounds that the companies held a derivative sovereign immunity from suits based on their status as government contractors pursuant to a battle-field preemption doctrine.\n\nOn November 14, 2006, legal proceedings invoking universal jurisdiction were begun in Germany against Donald Rumsfeld, Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo, George Tenet and others for their alleged involvement in prisoner abuse under the command responsibility. On April 27, 2007, the German federal prosecutor announced that the government would not pursue charges against Rumsfeld and the 11 other U.S. officials, stating the accusations did not apply, in part because there was insufficient evidence that the acts occurred on German soil, and because the accused did not live in Germany.\n\nIn June 2011, the Justice Department announced it was opening a grand jury investigation into CIA torture which killed a prisoner.\n\nIn June 2014, the U.S. court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia, found that an 18th-century law known as the Alien Tort Statute, allowed non-US citizens access to U.S. courts for violations of \"the law of nations or a treaty of the United States\". This would enable abused Iraqis to file suit against contractor CACI International. Employees of CACI International are being accused of encouraging torture and abuse as well as taking part in it as the four Iraqi's contend that they were \"repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun\", \"beaten on the genitals with a stick\", and forced to watch the \"rape [of] a female detainee\", during their time at the prison.\n\nCritics consider the Military Commissions Act of 2006 an amnesty law for crimes committed in the War on Terror by retroactively rewriting the War Crimes Act. It abolished habeas corpus for foreign detainees, effectively making it impossible for detainees to challenge crimes committed against them.\n\nOn October 29, 2007, the memoir of a soldier stationed in Abu Ghraib, Iraq from 2005 to 2006 was published. \"Torture Central\" chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.\n\nIn 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An Associated Press article said \n\nIn September 2010, Amnesty International warned in a report titled \"New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq\" that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the U.S. detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein's regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the military forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say: \"Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. U.S. authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by U.S. forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights.\"\n\nOn October 22, 2010, nearly 400,000 secret United States Army field reports and war logs, detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, \"The Guardian\", and several other international media organisations through the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. Among other things, the logs detail how U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape, and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appeared to be systematic and normally unpunished, and that U.S. troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.\n\nIn 2013, Associated Press stated that Engility Holdings, of Chantilly, Virginia, paid $5.28 million in a settlement to 71 former inmates held at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run detention sites between 2003 and 2007. The settlement was the first successful attempt by the detainees to obtain reparations for the abuses they had experienced.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51067", "title": "Anomie", "text": "Anomie\n\nAnomie () is a \"condition in which society provides little moral guidance to individuals\". It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e.g., under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory values. \n\nThe term is commonly understood to mean \"normlessness\", and believed to have been popularized by French sociologist √âmile Durkheim in his influential book \"Suicide\" (1897). However, Durkheim first introduces the concept of anomie in his 1893 work \"The Division of Labour In Society\". Durkheim never used the term \"normlessness\"; rather, he described anomie as \"derangement\", and \"an insatiable will\". Durkheim used the term \"the malady of the infinite\" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense.\n\nFor Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations. This is a nurtured condition:\nIn 1893 Durkheim introduced the concept of \"anomie\" to describe the mismatch of collective guild labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was homogeneous in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to \"mechanical solidarity\" whose inertia retarded adaptation. He contrasted this with the self-regulating behaviour of a division of labour based on differences in constituency, equated to \"organic solidarity\", whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.\n\nDurkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other.\n\nWhen solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible. Sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour. \"Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon the extent of the needs to be satisfied. Equilibrium is established without any trouble and production regulates itself.\" Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity: \n\nDurkheim's use of the term anomie was about the phenomenon of industrialization‚Äîmass-regimentation that could not adapt due to its own inertia‚Äîits resistance to change, which causes disruptive cycles of collective behavior e.g. economics, due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.\n\nLater in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated anomie to the influence of a lack of norms or norms that were too rigid. But such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a \"symptom of anomie\", caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to self-regulation, either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete.\n\nIn 1938 Robert K. Merton linked anomie with deviance and argued that the discontinuity between culture and structure have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them.\n\nThe word, \"a reborrowing with French spelling of \"anomy\"\", comes from Greek \"lawlessness\", namely the privative alpha prefix (\"a-\" \"without\"), and \"nomos\" \"law\". The Greeks distinguished between \"nomos\" (, \"law\"), and \"arch√©\" (, \"starting rule, axiom, principle\"). For example, a monarch is a single ruler but he or she might still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. \"nomos\". In the original city state democracy, the majority rule was an aspect of \"arch√©\" because it was a rule-based, customary system, which might or might not make laws, i.e. \"nomos\". Thus, the original meaning of \"anomie\" defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.\n\nThe contemporary English understanding of the word \"anomie\" can accept greater flexibility in the word \"norm\", and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of anarchy. But, as used by √âmile Durkheim and later theorists, \"anomie\" is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory social controls of society, and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.\n\nThe nineteenth century French pioneer sociologist √âmile Durkheim borrowed the word from French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau and used it in his influential book \"Suicide\" (1897), outlining the social (and not individual) causes of suicide, characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as normlessness), and an associated feeling of alienation and purposelessness. He believed that \"anomie\" is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent depression.\n\nIn Durkheim's view, traditional religions often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the division of labor that had been prevalent in economic life since the Industrial Revolution led individuals to pursue egoistic ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. Robert King Merton also adopted the idea of anomie to develop strain theory, defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the structural limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit deviant behavior. Friedrich Hayek notably uses the word \"anomie\" with this meaning.\n\nAccording to one academic survey, psychometric testing confirmed a link between anomie and academic dishonesty among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it. In another study, anomie was seen as a \"push factor\" in tourism.\n\nAs an older variant, the 1913 \"Webster's Dictionary\" reports use of the word \"anomie\" as meaning \"disregard or violation of the law\" but anomie as a social disorder is not to be confused with anarchy. Proponents of anarchism claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness. Some anarcho-primitivists argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.\n\nIn Albert Camus's existentialist novel \"The Stranger\", the bored, alienated protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old. He exists largely in a state of anomie, as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines: \"\" (\"Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don't know\").\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky expressed a similar concern about anomie in his novel \"The Brothers Karamazov\". The Grand Inquisitor remarks that in the absence of God and immortal life, everything would be lawful. In other words, that any act becomes thinkable, that there is no moral compass, which leads to apathy and detachment.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "547949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=547949", "title": "Clustering illusion", "text": "Clustering illusion\n\nThe clustering illusion is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable \"streaks\" or \"clusters\" arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to underpredict the amount of variability likely to appear in a small sample of random or semi-random data.\n\nThomas Gilovich, an early author on the subject, argued that the effect occurs for different types of random dispersions, including two-dimensional data such as clusters in the locations of impact of World War II V-1 flying bombs on maps of London; or seeing patterns in stock market price fluctuations over time. Although Londoners developed specific theories about the pattern of impacts within London, a statistical analysis by R. D. Clarke originally published in 1946 showed that the impacts of V-2 rockets on London were a close fit to a random distribution.\n\nThe clustering illusion is central to the \"hot hand fallacy\", the first study of which was reported by Gilovich, Robert Vallone and Amos Tversky. They found that the idea that basketball players shoot successfully in \"streaks\", sometimes referred to by sportcasters as having a \"hot hand\" and widely believed by Gilovich et al.'s subjects, was false. In the data they collected, if anything the success of a previous throw very slightly predicted a subsequent miss rather than another success.\n\nUsing this cognitive bias in causal reasoning may result in the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. More general forms of erroneous pattern recognition are \"pareidolia\" and \"apophenia\". Related biases are the \"illusion of control\" which the clustering illusion could contribute to, and \"insensitivity to sample size\" in which people don't expect greater variation in smaller samples. A different cognitive bias involving misunderstanding of chance streams is the gambler's fallacy.\n\nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky explained this kind of misprediction as being caused by the representativeness heuristic (which itself they also first proposed).\n\n\n"}

The program works with community groups such as local governments, police departments, universities, and non-profits.\n\nIn December 2016, the incoming Trump presidential transition team planned to stop the program from targeting white supremacists, which have committed bombings and shootings such as at a black church in Charleston. The program was also planned to be renamed to \"Countering Radical Islamic Extremism\". Congressional Republicans have criticized CVE for being politically correct, arguing that using the term \"Radical Islam\" would prevent violent attacks. Community groups have had concerns that the program could be used to target faith groups for surveillance. In May 2017, the Trump White House proposed to cut all funding to CVE. In July 2017, George Selim, a Republican who worked in the Bush administration and headed the CVE, resigned.

{"id": "16973885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16973885", "title": "Culture of honor (Southern United States)", "text": "Culture of honor (Southern United States)\n\nThe traditional culture of the Southern United States has been called a \"culture of honor\", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a reputation for not accepting improper conduct by others. A prevalent theory as to why the American South had or may have this culture is an assumed regional belief in retribution to enforce one's rights and deter predation against one‚Äôs family, home and possessions. The concept was tested by social scientists Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen in their book \"Culture of Honor\" and repopularized by a discussion in Chapter Six of \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell.\n\nThe \"culture of honor\" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region. Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated South East England and East Anglia) who settled in New England, the Southern United States was settled by herders from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Northern England and the West Country. Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft because they are mobile and there is little government wherewithal to enforce property rights of herd animals. The theory is that developing a reputation for violent retribution against those who stole herd animals was one way to discourage theft.\n\nThis thesis is limited, however, by modern evidence that a culture of honor in the American South is strongest not in the hill country, where this thesis suggests it has its cultural origins, but in Southern lowlands. These observers argue that poverty or religion, which has been distinctive in the American South since the Second Great Awakening in the 19th century, may be a more important source of this cultural phenomenon.\n\nOther theories point out that the culture of honor may have its roots in the settlement of the region by members of British aristocratic families.\n\nThe Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that ladies should not be insulted by gentlemen. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be chivalrous towards women, in words and deeds.\n\nAlthough \"culture of honor\" qualities have been generally associated with men in the southern United States, women in this region have also been affected and even shown some of the same qualities. In \"Culture of Honor\", it is stated that women play a part in the culture, both \"through their role in the socialization process, as well as active participation.\" By passing these ideas along to their children, they are taking part in social conditioning.\n\nLaboratory research has demonstrated that men in honor cultures perceive interpersonal threats more readily than do men in other cultures, including increases in cortisol and testosterone levels following insults. In culture-of-honor states, high school students were found to be more likely to bring a weapon to school in the past month and over a 20-year period, there were more than twice as many school shootings per capita. According to Lindsey Osterman and Ryan Brown in \"Culture of Honor and Violence Against the Self\", \"[i]ndividuals (particularly Whites) living in honor states are at an especially high risk for committing suicide.\"\n\nThe historian David Hackett Fischer, a Professor of History at Brandeis University, makes a case for an enduring genetic basis for a \"willingness to resort to violence\" (citing especially the finding of high blood levels of testosterone as discussed above) in the four main chapters of his book \"Albion's Seed\". He proposes that a Southern propensity for violence is inheritable by genetic changes wrought over generations living in traditional herding societies in Northern England, the Scottish Borders, and Irish Border Region. He proposes that this propensity has been transferred to other ethnic groups by shared culture, whence it can be traced to different urban populations of the United States. However, honor cultures were and are widely prevalent in Africa and many other places.\n\nRandolph Roth, in his \"American Homicide\" (2009), states that the idea of a culture of honor is oversimplified. He argues that the violence often committed by Southerners resulted from social tensions. He hypothesizes that when people feel that they are denied social success or the means to attain it, they will be more prone to commit violent acts. His argument is that Southerners were in tension, possibly due to poor Whites being marginalized by rich Whites, free and enslaved Blacks being denied basic rights, and rich and politically empowered Whites having their power threatened by Northern politicians pushing for more federal control of the South, especially over abolition. He argues that issues over honor just triggered the already present hostility, and that people took their frustration out through violent acts often on the surface over issues of honor. He draws historical records of violence across the U.S. and Europe to show that violence largely accompanies perceptions of political weakness and the inability to advance oneself in society. Roth also shows that although the South was \"obsessed with honor\" in the mid-18th century, there was relatively little homicide. Barring under-reported crime against some groups, low homicide may simply have been gentlemanly self-restraint at a time when social order was stable, a trend that reverses in the 19th century and later.\n\nA 2016 study suggests that honor culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under Southern presidents are \"twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results.\"\n\n\n"}

She was awarded a presidential medal for her efforts in development. She founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan as an advocacy group for Spanish-speaking women and as a result of their activism the group sent six delegates to the 1977 National Women's Conference, which was a part of the UN International Women's Year programs. Vorhauer served as vice chair of the delegation to the conference. She authored the \"Mason Miller Report\", an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan, leading to a state bi-lingual education law. When she lost her sight, due to diabetes, Vorhauer became an advocate for the blind. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1990, the first Latina to be honored in the hall.\n\nDelia Villegas was born on April 17, 1940 in El Paso, Texas to Consuelo (n√©e Olivares) and Dr. Bernardo Villegas. Her father was an optometrist, as had been his father, and the couple raised their two older sons and Delia, as well as their adopted daughter Rebecca in the traditions of their Mexican heritage. Villegas attended Catholic school across the border in Juarez, Mexico. At the age of thirteen, based on the family history and her perusal of her father‚Äôs medical books, Villegas diagnosed herself with diabetes, which the family physician confirmed. She attended El Paso High School, becoming the editor of the school newspaper, \"The Tatler\". Upon her graduation, Villegas moved to Chicago, where the family had relatives and enrolled Rosary College, in nearby River Forest, Illinois in 1958. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1962.\n\nUpon graduation, Villegas began her career as a social worker in the children's services department for Chicago working with adoptions and protective services. She also published a weekly column, \"Servicio Social\" in the local Spanish newspaper. In 1964, when the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) was expanded to include training and development programs for the non-English speaking population, Villegas was hired as a director of the program by the Archdiocesan Latin American Committee (ALAC) to help them implement services in the Chicago area. Besides giving vocational training and English lessons, the ALAC provided family and financial counseling services, as well as medical referral information. Special programs were also provided to target Chicago's Puerto Rican populations, providing them with adult language courses. In 1967, Villegas was one of five women out of fifty-two speakers called to testify before President Lyndon B. Johnson's Cabinet Commttee Hearing on all aspects of life, except the draft and women's issues, impacting the Hispanic community in the United States. That same year, she was recognized with a presidential medal for directing the most successful MDTA program in the United States.\n\nOn June 22, 1968, Villegas married William Federico Vorhauer and the couple relocated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where her husband was completing his graduate studies. Vorhauer to help put him through school, as the director of the Hispanic Affairs Division of the Boston Community Development office. She developed a store-front school for inner-city youth in Boston and coordinated the first \"city-wide conference on Puerto Rican affairs\". The following year, the couple moved to Bowling Green, Ohio, where Vorhauer worked as the State Supervisor of the Migrant Reception Centers for the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services, where she focused on migrants' relocation issues. In 1972, she returned to school to work on her master's degree and began working as the Director of the Mexican-American Project at Bowling Green State University. Completing her MA in sociology in 1974, she was hired by the Michigan Department of Education as a higher education consultant and the couple relocated to Lansing, Michigan.\n\nIn 1975, after attending a statewide conference for Latina women, Vorhauer founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan (MUM) (United Women of Michigan) as an advocacy group to support women, and was elected its chair in 1978. That same year, she was appointed by Governor William Milliken to serve on the Michigan Women's Commission, becoming both a member of the planning committee for the United Nations' International Women's Year program and vice-chair of the Michigan delegation to the national conference. As a result of their outreach to promote Latina women to leadership roles, MUM sent six members in the delegation of forty-eight Michigan women to attend the 1977 National Women's Conference in Houston, Texas. In 1976, Vorhauer authored the \"Mason Miller Report\", an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan. The report became the basis of a bi-lingual education law passed by the Michigan state government in 1978, and garnered Vorhauer coverage as one of eleven women \"Making It Happen\" in the March 1978 issue of \"Redbook\".\n\nVorhauer had by that time lost 90% of her sight from diabetic complications. In 1980, the same year she received a Diana Award in recognition of her community service dedication, she underwent surgery in hopes of restoring some of her vision. Though the surgery was unsuccessful, she returned to work as a program coordinator at the Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which assists citizens with disabilities in attaining self-sufficiency. Vorhauer traveled the state, establishing referral offices until 1988, when kidney failure forced her into retirement and dialysis. Within the year, she returned to work, accepting the vacated position of the chair of the Michigan Commission for the Blind, the first Hispanic to hold the post. Establishing a large-print newspaper, she also founded a support group for blind Catholics to attend Mass together, while heading the commission and over one hundred employees. In 1990, Vorhauer was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, the first Latina the organization had honored. Soon after the recognition, she retired and moved with her husband to Las Cruces, New Mexico, where her brother lived.\n\nVorhauser died on June 1, 1992 in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So-called war pigeons have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the Croix de guerre, awarded to Cher Ami, and the Dickin Medal awarded to the pigeons G.I. Joe and Paddy, amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.\n\nDomestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild rock pigeon. Generally humans will select breeding partners. Crop milk or pigeon milk produced by both male and female parent birds may occasionally be replaced with artificial substitutes. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called \"squeakers\" or \"squabs\".\n\nTrained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to 1000 km away. A special breed, called homing pigeons has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of pigeon racing and the white release dove ceremony at weddings and funerals.\n\nThe ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information. The first, called \"map sense\" is their geographic location. The second, \"compass sense\" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home. Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations. The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the Earth's magnetic field with tiny magnetic tissues in their head (magnetoception). This is all the more surprising as they are not a migratory species, which is a fact used by some ornithologists to dispute this theory. Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction. However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home. The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues\n\nOther potential cues used include:\n\nPigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds. Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are fledged and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food. For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named \"King pigeon,\" has been developed by selective breeding. Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as utility pigeons.\n\nPigeon fanciers developed many exotic forms of pigeon. These are generally classed as fancy pigeons. Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or breeds are judged to a standard to decide who has the best bird. Among those breeds are the English carrier pigeons, a variety of pigeon with wattles and a unique, almost vertical, stance (pictures). There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the \"Duchess\" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers. The fantail pigeons are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers.\n\nPigeons are also kept by enthusiasts for the enjoyment of Flying/Sporting competitions. Breeds such as tipplers are flown in endurance contests by their owners.\n\nDomestic pigeons are also commonly used in laboratory experiments in biology, medicine and cognitive science.\n\nPigeons have been trained to distinguish between cubist and impressionist paintings, for instance. In Project Sea Hunt, a US coast guard search and rescue project in the 1970s/1980s, pigeons were shown to be more effective than humans in spotting shipwreck victims at sea. Research in pigeons is widespread, encompassing shape and texture perception, exemplar and prototype memory, category-based and associative concepts, and many more unlisted here (see pigeon intelligence).\n\nPigeons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills, which form part of the ability to read, and basic numerical skills equivalent to those shown in primates.\n\nIn the United States, some pigeon keepers illegally trap and kill hawks and falcons to protect their pigeons. In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in Oregon and Washington, and that 1,000‚Äì2,000 are killed in southern California annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a Texan were also charged in the case.\n\nIn the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons. Eight illegal spring-loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died. The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a \"concerted campaign\" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands.\n\nPigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as \"bird fancier's lung\" or \"pigeon lung\". A form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, \"pigeon lung\" is caused by the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask.\nOther pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are \"Chlamydophila psittaci\" (which causes psittacosis, \"Histoplasma capsulatum\" (which causes histoplasmosis and \"Cryptococcus neoformans\", which causes cryptococcosis.\n\nMany domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the feral pigeon. These show a variety of plumages, although some look very much like pure rock pigeons. The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds. Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.\n\n\n"}

Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map as additive identity and the identity map as multiplicative identity.\n\nThe functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the category of the object under consideration. The endomorphism ring consequently encodes several internal properties of the object. As the resulting object is often an algebra over some ring \"R,\" this may also be called the endomorphism algebra.\n\nLet be an abelian group and we consider the group homomorphisms from \"A\" into \"A\".

{"id": "58891529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58891529", "title": "Eugenic feminism", "text": "Eugenic feminism\n\nEugenic feminism is a term coined by noted eugenicist Caleb Saleeby to describe areas of the women's suffrage movement which overlapped with eugenics. The term describes a branch of the early feminist movement that used some aspect of eugenics, such as the negative eugenic notion of restricting who could procreate, in an attempt to better the human species. Some eugenic feminists advocated for religious or moral reasons, such as Margaret Sanger who advocated for eugenics as an alternative to birth control and abortion. Sanger sought to \"assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit.\" Sanger having a somewhat different opinion than mainstream eugenicists in her time noted that \"eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her duty to the state.\" Sanger supported negative eugenics, the practice of improving human genetic traits through social intervention by reducing the reproduction of those who were considered unfit. Some early suffragettes in Canada in particular a group known as The Famous Five also pushed for eugenic policies, particularly in Alberta and British Columbia.\n\nIn Eugenics there is a focus on women as the bearers of the future ‚Äúrace.‚Äù In Galton's original formulation of eugenics women were seen as a mere conduit to pass \"genius\" from father to son, however as the movement progressed there was increasing importance placed on women as ‚Äúmothers of the race‚Äù. The emphasis of women in eugenics led eventually to eugenicist Caleb Saleeby (1878-1940) coining the term ‚Äúeugenic feminism‚Äù in \"Woman and Womanhood: A Search for Principles\" Saleeby disagreeing with some sexist eugenic principles, in light of new research on heredity at the time notes that:\nIf it were true that woman is merely the vessel and custodian of the future lives of men and women, entrusted to her antenatal care by their fathers, as many creeds have supposed, then indeed it would be a question of relatively small moment how the mothers of the future were chosen.[...]\n\nBut directly we observe, under the microscope, the facts of development, we discover that each\nparent contributes an exactly equal share to the making of the new individual, and all the ancient and modern ideas of the superior value of well-selected fatherhood fall to the ground. Woman is indeed half the race.[...]\n\nAnd thus it matters for the future at least as much how the mothers are chosen as how the fathers are.[...]\nWoman is half the race; and the leaders of the woman's movement must recognize the importance of their sex in this fundamental question of eugenics.\n\nThere is possible no Eugenic Feminism which shall satisfy those whose simple argument is that woman must have what she wants, just as man must.[...]\n\nNo one will question that the position and happiness and self-realization of women in the modern world would be vastly enhanced by the reforms for which I plead, though some men will not think that game worth the candle.\nAt the turn of the 20th century as the Women's Suffrage movement began, and eugenic feminists used eugenics in the argument for being granted the right to vote. They argued that not only must their social conditions be ameliorated in order to improve the human race, but also that they must be given power as women‚Äôs moral superiority toward social space made them uniquely suited to cleaning up corruption. Devereux characterizes Saleeby's invention of \"Eugenic Feminism\" as \"at least partly a deceptive rhetorical strategy\" whose goal was to \"draw middle-class women's rights activists \"back\" to home and duty\".\n\nDifferent versions of eugenic feminism arose between 1890 and 1930, but each shared in the argument that the eugenic decline of the race could be prevented only if women were granted greater political, social, sexual, and economic equality.\n\nIn the 1930s eugenic feminism began to decline as eugenic feminists began to fall out with mainstream eugenicists, and had largely failed to sway the public opinion.\n\nIn Canada, all members of the suffragist group known as the \"Famous Five\" were known to support eugenics, including Emily Murphy and Nellie McClung, the latter notably supporting the 1928 Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta and the 1933 Sexual Sterilization Act of British Columbia.\n\nBritish eugenicists such as Caleb Saleeby, Karl Pearson, and Havelock Ellis, held that women were essentially reproductive agents.[...] Proponents of mainstream eugenics and some early advocates of women‚Äôs rights found common ground. Not all early feminists supported eugenic practices, but the notion of social advancement as intricately tied to reproduction was central to both eugenicists and early feminists.[...] Some suffragists advocated for staunch immigration policies and eugenic practices such as mental hygiene and the social segregation and sexual sterilization of the ‚Äúfeeble-minded.‚Äù\n\nIn the United Kingdom Marie Stopes an early feminist, founded the first birth control clinic in the UK in 1921. Stopes was opposed to abortion and contraception, preferring that \"unfit\" children were not conceived in the first place. In 1920 Stopes wrote ‚ÄúI would legislate compulsory sterilization of the insane, feeble minded‚Ä¶ revolutionaries‚Ä¶ half castes‚Äù.\n\nIn the United states some feminists advocated for legal reform involving some aspects of eugenics, notably \"The National Federation of Women's Clubs\", the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and the National League of Women Voters had at some point lobbied for eugenic legislation. One of the most prominent feminists to push for eugenics was Margaret Sanger, the leader of the American birth control movement. Unlike mainstream eugenicists, Sanger still believed that it should be the choice of the individual woman whether or not to have children, not that of the state. Though she believed those who were unfit should not procreate, she rejected some aspects of negative eugenics such as euthanasia of those deemed unfit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "244588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244588", "title": "Heliocentrism", "text": "Heliocentrism\n\nHeliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention‚Äîpossibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\n\nIt was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.\n\nWith the observations of William Herschel, Friedrich Bessel, and other astronomers, it was realized that the sun, while near the barycenter of the solar system, was not at any center of the universe.\n\nWhile the sphericity of the Earth was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 3rd century BC, the Earth's daily rotation and yearly orbit around the Sun was never universally accepted until the Copernican Revolution.\n\nWhile a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in Pythagoreanism, and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the geocentric model described in Ptolemy's \"Almagest\".\n\nThe Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy. \nPtolemy himself, in his \"Almagest\", points out that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used.\nHowever, he rejected the idea of a spinning earth as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. His planetary hypotheses were sufficiently real that the distances of moon, sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits' celestial spheres as contiguous realities. This made the stars' distance less than 20 Astronomical Units, a regression, since Aristarchus of Samos's heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier necessarily placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.\n\nProblems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the Copernican heliocentrism developed in Renaissance astronomy.\n\nThe non-geocentric model of the Universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the Universe was a \"central fire\", around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion. This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the \"counter-earth\" invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary. Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' \"central fire\" as the Sun, \"as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings\".\n\nHeraclides of Pontus (4th century BC) said that the rotation of the Earth explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed Mercury and Venus to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth. Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius (AD 395‚Äì423) later described this as the \"Egyptian System,\" stating that \"it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians,\" though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt.\n\nThe first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system, however, was Aristarchus of Samos (\"c\". 270 BC). Like Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth, and measured the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought the larger object would have the most attractive force.\n\nHis writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, Archimedes, and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus's theory is given in the former's book, \"The Sand Reckoner\". The entire description comprises just three sentences, which Thomas Heath translates as follows:\n\nAristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their parallax would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful telescopes had been developed.\n\nNo references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the common era. The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of Plutarch. These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes's account‚Äî namely, that Aristarchus's theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in \"On the Face in the Orb of the Moon\":\n\nOnly scattered fragments of Cleanthes's writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\", Diogenes Laertius lists \"A reply to Aristarchus\" (Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ ·ºàœÅŒØœÉœÑŒ±œÅœáŒøŒΩ) as one of Cleanthes's works, and some scholars have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety.\n\nThe second of the references by Plutarch is in his \"Platonic Questions\":\nThe remaining references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in A√´tius's \"Opinions of the Philosophers\", Sextus Empiricus's \"Against the Mathematicians\", and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle. Another passage in A√´tius's \"Opinions of the Philosophers\" reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.\n\nSince Plutarch mentions the \"followers of Aristarchus\" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a Hellenistic astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the Seleucid empire. Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus. Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. A fragment of a work by Seleucus has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by Rhazes (b. 865).\n\nAlternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of tides, which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the Moon and by the revolution of the Earth around the Earth and Moon's center of mass.\n\nThere were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In Roman Carthage, the pagan Martianus Capella (5th century A.D.) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun. Capella's model was discussed in the Early Middle Ages by various anonymous 9th-century commentators and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work.\n\nThe Ptolemaic system was also received in Indian astronomy.\nAryabhata (476‚Äì550), in his magnum opus \"Aryabhatiya\" (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun. He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the solar and lunar eclipses, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon. Early followers of Aryabhata's model included Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II.\n\nFor a time, Muslim astronomers accepted the Ptolemaic system and the geocentric model, which were used by to show that the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies. In the 10th century, accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis. According to later astronomer al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe called \"al-z≈´raqƒ´\" based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries that the apparent motion of the stars was due to the Earth's movement, and not that of the firmament. Islamic astronomers began to criticize the Ptolemaic model, including Ibn al-Haytham in his \" 'alƒÅ Ba·π≠alamiy≈´s\" (\"Doubts Concerning Ptolemy\", c. 1028), who branded it an impossibility.\nAl-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his \"Masudic Canon\" (1031), he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth. He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations, but considered it a problem of natural philosophy rather than one of mathematics.\n\nIn the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical. His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.\n\nThe Maragha school of astronomy in Ilkhanid-era Persia further developed \"non-Ptolemaic\" planetary models involving Earth's rotation. Notable astronomers of this school are Al-Urdi (d. 1266) Al-Katibi (d. 1277), and Al-Tusi (d. 1274).\n\nThe arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth's motion. \nThe criticism of Ptolemy as developed by Averroes and by the Maragha school explicitly address the Earth's rotation but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism. \nThe observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era Samarkand observatory under Qushji (1403‚Äì1474).\n\nEuropean scholarship in the later medieval period actively received astronomical models developed in the Islamic world and by the 13th century was well aware of the problems of the Ptolemaic model. In the 14th century, bishop Nicole Oresme discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in his \"Learned Ignorance\" asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe. In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that \"Thus the fabric of the world (\"machina mundi\") will \"quasi\" have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,\" recalling Hermes Trismegistus.\n\nIn India, Nilakantha Somayaji (1444‚Äì1544), in his \"Aryabhatiyabhasya\", a commentary on Aryabhata's \"Aryabhatiya\", developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe. In the \"Tantrasamgraha\" (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and Copernican models, but did not propose any specific models of the universe. Nilakantha's planetary system also incorporated the Earth's rotation on its axis. Most astronomers of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics seem to have accepted his planetary model.\n\nSome historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory, in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple, influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by Copernicus. \nCopernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources. \nFurthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the \"Commentariolus\" was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus. Copernicus' lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Al-Shatir's.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452‚Äì1519) wrote \"Il sole non si move.\" (\"The Sun does not move.\") \n\nThe state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in Georg von Peuerbach's \"Theoricae Novae Planetarum\" (printed in 1472 by Regiomontanus). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.\nWhile the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the \nMaragha school, postulated by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957, remains an open question. Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the \"Islamic Golden Age\" (10th to 12th centuries) in \"De Revolutionibus\": Albategnius (Al-Battani), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra), Arzachel (Al-Zarqali), and Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school.\n\nIt has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus's \"Commentary on the First Book of Euclid\", which Copernicus cited. \nAnother possible source for Copernicus's knowledge of this mathematical device is the \"Questiones de Spera\" of Nicole Oresme, who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus in his \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" (\"On the revolution of heavenly spheres\", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his \"Almagest\".\nCopernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets. In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus's system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system. This theory resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than real: it was a parallax effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric Tychonic system; the latter, however, while eliminating the major epicycles, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a \"pretzel\".\n\nCopernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of \"De Revolutionibus\" (which still survives), stating: \"Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion.\" However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by Cicero he had found an account of the theories of Hicetas and that Plutarch had provided him with an account of the Pythagoreans, Heraclides Ponticus, Philolaus, and Ecphantus. These authors had proposed a moving earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun.\n\nThe first information about the heliocentric views of Nicolaus Copernicus was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514. Although only in manuscript, Copernicus' ideas were well known among astronomers and others. His ideas contradicted the then-prevailing understanding of the Bible. In the King James Bible (first published in 1611), First Chronicles 16:30 states that \"the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.\" Psalm 104:5 says, \"[the Lord] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.\" Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that \"The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.\"\n\nNonetheless, in 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals. On November 1, 1536, Archbishop of Capua Nikolaus von Sch√∂nberg wrote a letter to Copernicus from Rome encouraging him to publish a full version of his theory.\n\nHowever, in 1539, Martin Luther said:\n\nThis was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. Melanchthon, however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus published the definitive statement of his system in \"De Revolutionibus\" in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to Pope Paul III, the published form contained an unsigned preface by Osiander defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be heretical during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among Dominicans that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.\n\nSome years after the publication of \"De Revolutionibus\" John Calvin preached a sermon in which he denounced those who \"pervert the order of nature\" by saying that \"the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns\".\n\nOn the other hand, Calvin is \"not\" responsible for another famous quotation which has often been misattributed to him: \"Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit?\" It has long been established that this line cannot be found in any of Calvin's works. It has been suggested that the quotation was originally sourced from the works of Lutheran theologian Abraham Calovius.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"De Revolutionibus\", the most widely accepted system had been proposed by Ptolemy, in which the Earth was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. Tycho Brahe, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus's heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: a geo-heliocentric system now known as the Tychonic system in which the five then known planets orbit the sun, while the sun and the moon orbit the earth.\n\nTycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The Aristotelian physics of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called aether that moved naturally. So Tycho said that the Copernican system \"... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.\" Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory ‚Äì see stellar magnitude), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, \"Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.\" He also cited the Copernican system's \"opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place\" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative \"offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture\".\n\nThe Jesuit astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, Clavius, commented that Tycho was \"confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have Mars lower than the Sun.\" However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became very popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century (see Riccioli).\n\nGalileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his discoveries that the Sun rotated and that Venus exhibited a full range of phases in his \"Letters on Sunspots\" (1613). These discoveries were not consistent with the Ptolemeic model of the Solar System. As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved toward Tycho's teachings.\n\nIn his 1615 \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took Augustine's position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the sun in motion across the sky.\n\nIn February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccol√≤ Lorini brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the Council of Trent. Cardinal and Inquisitor Robert Bellarmine was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be \"a very dangerous thing,\" irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming \"the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false.\"\n\nIn January 1616 Msgr. Francesco Ingoli addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February. According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the \"chief direct basis\" for the ban. The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory \"clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.\" Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.\n\nIn February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\" The Inquisition also determined that the Earth's motion \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith.\" Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo\n\nIn March, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal Master of the Sacred Palace, Congregation of the Index, and Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called \"the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.\" In 1618 the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' \"De Revolutionibus\" be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.\n\nIn \"Astronomia nova\" (1609), Johannes Kepler had used an elliptical orbit to explain the motion of Mars. In \"Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae\" (1617‚Äì1621) he developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted. Galileo for example completely ignored Kepler's work. Kepler proposed heliocentrism as a physical description of the Solar System and \"Epitome astronomia Copernicanae\" was placed on the index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.\n\nPope Urban VIII encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, \"Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems\" (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,\nI will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...\nand his straightforward statement,\n\nI might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre...\nSome ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character Simplicio. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome. Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between \"teaching\" and \"holding and defending as true\". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life.\n\nAccording to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's \"appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance.\"\n\nRen√© Descartes postponed, and ultimately never finished, his treatise \"The World\", which included a heliocentric model, but the Galileo affair did little to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's \"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\" became increasingly influential in the coming decades. By 1686 the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\", published in France by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and translated into English and other languages in the coming years. It has been called \"one of the first great popularizations of science.\"\n\nIn 1687, Isaac Newton published \"Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of universal gravitation and what came to be known as Newton's laws of motion. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the solar system. For Newton it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called \"meridiane\"; i.e., they were turned into \"reverse sundials\", or gigantic pinhole cameras, where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line.\n\nIn 1664, Pope Alexander VII published his \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus\" (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, P.M.) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.\n\nIn the mid-eighteenth century the Church's opposition began to fade. An annotated copy of Newton's \"Principia\" was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the \"Index of Forbidden Books\". \nThe Observatory of the Roman College was established by Pope Clement XIV in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by Pope Leo XIII as the Vatican Observatory in 1891). \nIn spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's \"De Revolutionibus\" or Galileo's \"Dialogue\". The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Church's chief censor), Filippo Anfossi, refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact. Settele appealed to pope Pius VII. After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned. Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. \nCopernicus's \"De Revolutionibus\" and Galileo's \"Dialogue\" were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the \"Index\" when it appeared in 1835.\n\nAlready in the Talmud, Greek philosophy and science under general name \"Greek wisdom\" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods. \n\nThe first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name, was Maharal of Prague, his book \"Be'er ha-Golah\" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of radical skepticism, arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.\n\nCopernicus is mentioned in the books of David Gans (1541‚Äì1613), who worked with Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one \"Magen David\" (1612) and a full one \"Nehmad veNaim\" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: Ptolemy, Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe without taking sides.\nJoseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591‚Äì1655) in his \"Elim\" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them. Delmedigo studied at Padua and was acquainted with Galileo.\n\nAn actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period accept Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from David Nieto and Tobias Cohn. Both of these authors argued against heliocentrism on grounds of contradictions to scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus \"a first-born of Satan\", though he also acknowledged that he would have found it difficult to counter one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.\n\nIn the 19th century two students of the Hatam sofer wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. The one, a commentary on Genesis \"Yafe‚Äôah le-Ketz\" written by R. Israel David Schlesinger resisted a heliocentric model and supported geocentrism. The other, \"Mei Menuchot\" written by R. Eliezer Lipmann Neusatz encouraged acceptance of the heliocentric model and other modern scientific thinking.\n\nSince the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include Shlomo Benizri and R. M.M. Schneerson of Chabad who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the relativity of motion. Schneerson's followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model.\n\nKepler's laws of planetary motion were used as arguments in favor of the heliocentric hypothesis. Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by James Bradley, in 1838 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and in 1851 by Foucault. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the earth. Bessel proved that the parallax of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of a star named 61 Cygni. In the same year Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson measured the parallaxes of other stars, Vega and Alpha Centauri.\n\nThe thinking that the heliocentric view was also not true in a strict sense was achieved in steps. That the Sun was not the center of the universe, but one of innumerable stars, was strongly advocated by the mystic Giordano Bruno. Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the status of the Sun as merely one star among many became increasingly obvious. By the 20th century, even before the discovery that there are many galaxies, it was no longer an issue.\n\nThe concept of an absolute velocity, including being \"at rest\" as a particular case, is ruled out by the principle of relativity, also eliminating any obvious \"center\" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Some forms of Mach's principle consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.\n\nEven if the discussion is limited to the solar system, the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one focus of the elliptical orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the solar system is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun. (The masses of the planets, mostly Jupiter, amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.) Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an extrasolar planet would observe a small \"wobble\" in the Sun's motion.\n\nIn modern calculations, the terms \"geocentric\" and \"heliocentric\" are often used to refer to reference frames. In such systems the origin in the center of mass of the Earth, of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire solar system, can be selected. Right ascension and declination are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations. This leads to such terms as \"heliocentric velocity\" and \"heliocentric angular momentum\". In this heliocentric picture, any planet of the Solar System can be used as a source of mechanical energy because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller body (either artificial or natural) may gain heliocentric velocity due to gravity assist¬†‚Äì this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of \"geocentric\" or \"heliocentric\" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific model. From the point of view of general relativity, inertial reference frames do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision.\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\n\n"}

E. Moore wrote \"A Defence of Common Sense\" and \"Proof of an External World\". For the purposes of these essays, he posed skeptical hypotheses, such as \"you may be dreaming\" or \"the world is 5 minutes old\", and then provided his own response to them. Such hypotheses ostensibly create a situation where it is not possible to know that anything in the world exists. These hypotheses take the following form:\n\nWhere S is a subject, sp is a skeptical possibility, such as the brain in a vat hypothesis, and q is a knowledge claim about the world:\n\nMoore does not attack the skeptical premise; instead, he reverses the argument from being in the form of modus ponens to modus tollens. This logical maneuver is often called a G. E. Moore shift or a Moorean shift. His response takes the following form:\n\nMoore famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay \"Proof of an External World\", in which he gave a common sense argument against skepticism by raising his right hand and saying \"here is one hand,\" and then raising his left and saying \"and here is another\". Here, Moore is taking his knowledge claim (q) to be that he has two hands, and without rejecting the skeptic's premise, seeks to prove that we can know the skeptical possibility (sp) to be untrue.\n\nMoore's argument is not simply a flippant response to the skeptic. Moore gives, in \"Proof of an External World\", three requirements for a good proof: (1) the premises must be different from the conclusion, (2) the premises must be demonstrated, and (3) the conclusion must follow from the premises. He claims that his proof of an external world meets those three criteria.\n\nIn his 1925 essay \"A Defence of Common Sense\", Moore argues against idealism and skepticism toward the external world on the grounds that skeptics could not give reasons to accept their metaphysical premises that were more plausible to him than the reasons he had to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world that skeptics and idealists must deny. In other words, he is more willing to believe that he has a hand than to believe the premises of what he deems \"a strange argument in a university classroom.\" \"I do not think it is rational to be as certain of any one of these ... propositions\".\n\nSome subsequent philosophers (especially those inclined to skeptical doubts) have found Moore's method of argument unconvincing.\n\nOne form of refutation contends that Moore's attempted proof fails his second criterion for a good proof (i.e. the premises are not demonstrable in the required sense) by pointing out the difference between demonstrating the perception that his hands exist and demonstrating the knowledge that his hands exist. Moore may be doing the former when he means to be doing the latter.\n\nAnother form of refutation simply points out that not everyone shares Moore's intuition. If a person finds the skeptical possibility sp more intuitively likely than the knowledge claim q, then for that person Moore's own defense of intuition provides a basis for their skepticism.\n\nAppeals of this type are subsequently often called \"Moorean facts\". \"A Moorean fact [is] one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary\".\n\nThe \"here is one hand\" idea deeply influenced Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose last writings were devoted to a new approach to Moore's argument. These remarks were published posthumously as \"On Certainty\".\n\n\n"}

The same characters are pronounced as Hanzi in Chinese Putonghua, Hanja in Korean, and Kanji in Japanese), \"H√°n vƒÉn\" (Êº¢Êñá \"Han script\"), or \"ch·ªØ nho\" (Â≠óÂÑí \"words of Confucians\"). \"H√°n vƒÉn\" (Êº¢Êñá) (literally 'Han literature') denotes Chinese language literature.\n\nThe Vietnamese word \"ch·ªØ\" (character, script, writing, letter) is derived from a Middle Chinese pronunciation of Â≠ó (Modern Pinyin: z√¨), meaning 'character'.\n\nSino-Vietnamese (Vietnamese: \"t·ª´ H√°n Vi·ªát\" Ë©ûÊº¢Ë∂ä \"Sino-Vietnamese words\") is a term which is used by modern scholars in relation to Vietnam's Chinese-language texts to emphasise local characteristics and particularly the phonology of the Chinese written in Vietnam, though in regard to syntax and vocabulary this Sino-Vietnamese was no more different from Chinese used in Beijing than medieval English Latin was different from the Latin of Rome.\n\nThe term ch·ªØ N√¥m (Â≠óÂñÉ \"Southern characters\") refers to the former transcription system for vernacular Vietnamese-language texts, written using a mixture of original Chinese characters and locally coined n√¥m characters not found in Chinese to phonetically represent Vietnamese sounds.\" However the character set for ch·ªØ n√¥m is extensive, up to 20,000, and both arbitrary in composition and inconsistent in pronunciation.\n\n\"H√°n N√¥m\" (Êº¢ÂñÉ ‚ÄòHan and ch·ªØ N√¥m characters‚Äô) may mean either both H√°n and N√¥m taken together, as in the research remit of Hanoi's H√°n-N√¥m Institute, or refer to texts which are written in a mixture of H√°n and N√¥m, or refer to some H√°n texts with parallel N√¥m translations. There is a significant orthographic overlap between H√°n and N√¥m and many characters are used in both H√°n and N√¥m with the same reading.\n\nThe term ch·ªØ qu·ªëc ng·ªØ (Â≠óÂúãË™û \"national language script\") means Vietnamese written in romanised script.\n\nNo known writings in Chinese by Vietnamese writers survive from the Chinese domination period.\n\nIn Imperial Vietnam (939-1919), formal writings were, in most cases, done in classical Chinese. This was true both of the language of government and administration, and also of entry into government and administration by the wholly Chinese-language Confucian examination system in Vietnam. Chinese was also the language of medicine, astrology, religion, science and high literature such as poetry. Vietnamese existed only as an oral language, before the creation of the nom script to preserve and circulate less serious poetry and narrative literature. These writings are indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in China, Korea, or Japan as are the first poems in ch·ªØ nho by the monk Khu√¥ng Vi·ªát (Âå°Ë∂ä) and the \"Nam Qu·ªëc S∆°n H√†\" (H√°n-Vi·ªát/Sino-Vietnamese) / \"S√¥ng n√∫i n∆∞·ªõc Nam\" (Native Vietnamese) / ÂçóÂúãÂ±±Ê≤≥ (H√°n-N√¥m) by general L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát (ÊùéÂ∏∏ÂÇë).\n\nIn Vietnam, classical Chinese texts were read with the vocalization of Chinese text as such, equivalent to the Chinese On-readings in Japanese \"kambun\" (), or the assimilated vocalizations in Korean \"hanmun\" (). This occurred alongside entry of Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary into the vernacular Vietnamese language, and created, in Samuel Martin's term, a Sinoxenic dialect. The Sinologist Edwin G. Pulleyblank was the one of the first linguists to actively employ \"Sino-Vietnamese\" to recover the earlier history of Chinese.\n\nFrom the 13th Century the dominance of Chinese writing - ch·ªØ nho - began to be challenged by a system of modified and invented characters modeled loosely on Chinese characters called \"ch·ªØ n√¥m\", which, unlike the system of ch·ªØ nho (or ch·ªØ H√°n), allowed for the expression of purely Vietnamese words, was created in Vietnam at least as early as the 13th century. During the Ming dynasty occupation of Vietnam ch·ªØ n√¥m printing blocks, texts and inscriptions were destroyed, so that the earliest surviving texts are from after the period. While designed for native Vietnamese speakers, ch·ªØ n√¥m required the user to have a fair knowledge of ch·ªØ H√°n, and thus ch·ªØ n√¥m was used primarily for literary writings by cultural elites (such as the poetry of Nguy·ªÖn Du and H·ªì Xu√¢n H∆∞∆°ng), while almost all other official writings and documents continued to be written in classical Chinese until the 20th century.\n\nThe use of classical Chinese, and its written form, ch·ªØ nho (or ch·ªØ H√°n), died out in Vietnam early in the 20th century during the middle years of French Indochina. At this time there were briefly four competing writing systems in Vietnam; ch·ªØ nho, ch·ªØ n√¥m, qu·ªëc ng·ªØ, and French. Although the first romanized script qu·ªëc ng·ªØ newspaper, \"Gia Dinh Bao\", was founded in 1865, Vietnamese nationalists continued to use ch·ªØ n√¥m until after the First World War when qu·ªëc ng·ªØ became the favoured language of the Vietnamese independence movement. Some scholars still study it today although its application is mostly confined to the historic context of Vietnamese texts.\n\nIndividual \"H√°n t·ª±\" are still written by calligraphers for special occasions such as the Vietnamese New Year, T·∫øt.\n\nUse of qu·ªëc ng·ªØ for education in both North and South Vietnam from 1945-1975, and then all of Vietnam since 1975, has rendered most Vietnamese unable to read earlier Vietnamese texts, whether written in Chinese ch·ªØ nho, or vernacular ch·ªØ n√¥m. H√°n N√¥m Institute is the national centre for academic research into both H√°n and n√¥m texts. Since the mid-1990s a small resurgence in teaching of Chinese characters, both for ch·ªØ nho and the additional characters used in ch·ªØ n√¥m, to enable the study of Vietnam's history has emerged. Additionally, many Vietnamese study H√°n t·ª± characters as a part of learning modern Japanese and Chinese, and sometimes Korean. This allows a Vietnamese speaker to learn a word in the target language (represented by Chinese characters) in relation to the Vietnamese cognate reading. The significance of the characters has occasionally entered Western depiction of Vietnam; for instance novelist E. M. Nathanson mentions the characters in \"A Dirty Distant War\" (1987).\n\nFor linguists the Sino-Vietnamese readings of Chinese characters provide data for the study of historical Chinese phonology.\n"}
{"id": "340757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340757", "title": "Internal energy", "text": "Internal energy\n\nIn thermodynamics, the internal energy of a system is the energy contained within the system, excluding the kinetic energy of motion, of the system as a whole and the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state.\n\nThe internal energy of a system can be changed by transfers of matter or heat or by doing work. When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system is said to be closed. Then the first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.\n\nThe internal energy is one of the two cardinal state functions of the state variables of a thermodynamic system.\n\nThe internal energy of a given state of a system cannot be directly measured. It is determined through some convenient chain of thermodynamic operations and thermodynamic processes by which the given state can be prepared, starting with a reference state which is customarily assigned a reference value for its internal energy. Such a chain, or path, can be theoretically described by certain extensive state variables of the system, namely, its entropy, , its volume, , and its mole numbers, }. The internal energy, , is a function of those. Sometimes, to that list are appended other extensive state variables, for example electric dipole moment. For practical considerations in thermodynamics and engineering it is rarely necessary or convenient to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Customarily, thermodynamic descriptions include only items relevant to the processes under study. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with \"changes\" in the internal energy, not with its absolute value.\n\nThe internal energy is a state function of a system, because its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an extensive quantity. It is the one and only \"cardinal\" thermodynamic potential. Through it, by use of Legendre transforms, are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their conjugate intensive variables. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.\n\nThough it is a macroscopic quantity, internal energy can be explained in microscopic terms by two theoretical virtual components. One is the microscopic kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system's particles (translations, rotations, vibrations). The other is the potential energy associated with the microscopic forces, including the chemical bonds, between the particles; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry. If thermonuclear reactions are specified as a topic of concern, then the static rest mass energy of the constituents of matter is also counted. There is no simple universal relation between these quantities of microscopic energy and the quantities of energy gained or lost by the system in work, heat, or matter transfer.\n\nThe SI unit of energy is the joule (J). Sometimes it is convenient to use a corresponding density called \"specific internal energy\" which is internal energy per unit of mass (kilogram) of the system in question. The SI unit of specific internal energy is J/kg. If the specific internal energy is expressed relative to units of amount of substance (mol), then it is referred to as \"molar internal energy\" and the unit is J/mol.\n\nFrom the standpoint of statistical mechanics, the internal energy is equal to the ensemble average of the sum of the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system.\n\nThe internal energy, , expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the \"energy-language\", or in the \"energy representation\". Its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, , of the same list of extensive variables of state, except that the entropy, , is replaced in the list by the internal energy, . It expresses the \"entropy representation\".\n\nEach cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its \"natural\" or \"canonical\" variables. Each provides its \"characteristic\" or \"fundamental\" equation, for example , that by itself contains all thermodynamic information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, for , to get .\n\nIn contrast, Legendre transforms are necessary to derive fundamental equations for other thermodynamic potentials and Massieu functions. The entropy as a function only of extensive state variables is the one and only \"cardinal function\" of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself customarily designated a 'Massieu function', though rationally it might be thought of as such, corresponding to the term 'thermodynamic potential', which includes the internal energy.\n\nFor real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the understanding of thermodynamics.\n\nThe internal energy of a given state of the system is determined relative to that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the given state:\nwhere denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state and that of the reference state,\nand the are the various energies transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given state.\nIt is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the reference state.\n\nFrom a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into microscopic potential energy, , and microscopic kinetic energy, , components:\n\nThe microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the chemical and nuclear particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal induced electric or magnetic dipole moment, as well as the energy of deformation of solids (stress-strain). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.\n\nInternal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy the body may have because of its motion or location in external gravitational, electrostatic, or electromagnetic fields. It does, however, include the contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal degrees of freedom of the object with the field. In such a case, the field is included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an additional external parameter.\n\nFor practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study. Indeed, in most systems under consideration, especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy. Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy.\n\nThe internal energy is an extensive property: it depends on the size of the system, or on the amount of substance it contains.\n\nAt any temperature greater than absolute zero, microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant in an isolated system (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the zero point energy. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable entropy.\n\nThe microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the temperature of the system. Statistical mechanics relates the pseudo-random kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy is often referred to as the \"thermal energy\" of a system, relating this energy, like the temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.\n\nStatistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed across an ensemble of \"N\" microstates. Each microstate has an energy \"E\" and is associated with a probability \"p\". The internal energy is the mean value of the system's total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted by their probability of occurrence:\nThis is the statistical expression of the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nThermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with the changes, , in internal energy.\n\nFor a closed system, with matter transfer excluded, the changes in internal energy are due to heat transfer and due to work. The latter can be split into two kinds, pressure-volume work , and frictional and other kinds, such as electrical polarization, which do not alter the volume of the system, and are called isochoric, . Accordingly, the internal energy change for a process may be written\n\nWhen a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this distribution. In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is said to be \"sensible\".\n\nA second mechanism of change of internal energy of a closed system is the doing of work on the system, either in mechanical form by changing pressure or volume, or by other perturbations, such as directing an electric current through the system.\n\nIf the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal energy is transfer of matter into the system. This increase, cannot be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically that heat and work can be done on it by pathways separate from and independent of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal energy:\n\nIf a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a \"latent energy\", or latent heat, in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.\n\nThermodynamics often uses the concept of the ideal gas for teaching purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems are approximated by the monatomic gases, helium and the other noble gases. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the translational energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not rotate or vibrate, and are not electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures.\n\nTherefore, internal energy changes in an ideal gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the internal energy of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its pressure, volume and thermodynamic temperature.\n\nThe internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its mass (number of moles) \"n\" and to its temperature \"T\"\n\nwhere \"c\" is the heat capacity (at constant volume) of the gas. The internal energy may be written as a function of the three extensive properties \"S\", \"V\", \"n\" (entropy, volume, mass) in the following way \n\nwhere \"const\" is an arbitrary positive constant and where \"R\" is the universal gas constant. It is easily seen that \"U\" is a linearly homogeneous function of the three variables (that is, it is \"extensive\" in these variables), and that it is weakly convex. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives \nformula_9 formula_10 the ideal gas law formula_11 immediately follows.\n\nThis above summation of all components of change in internal energy assume that a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or work done on the system, while a negative energy denotes work of the system on the environment.\n\nTypically this relationship is expressed in infinitesimal terms using the differentials of each term. Only the internal energy is an exact differential. For a system undergoing only thermodynamics processes, i.e. a closed system that can exchange only heat and work, the change in the internal energy is\nwhich constitutes the first law of thermodynamics. It may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an intensive variable (a generalized force) and its conjugate infinitesimal extensive variable (a generalized displacement).\n\nFor example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system may be related to the pressure \"p\" and volume \"V\". The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:\nThis defines the direction of work, \"W\", to be energy flow from the working system to the surroundings, indicated by a negative term. Taking the direction of heat transfer \"Q\" to be into the working fluid and assuming a reversible process, the heat is\n\nand the change in internal energy becomes\n\nThe expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is\n\nThis is useful if the equation of state is known.\n\nIn case of an ideal gas, we can derive that formula_19, i.e. the internal energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the temperature.\n\nThe expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is\n\nThe equation of state is the ideal gas law\n\nSolve for pressure:\n\nSubstitute in to internal energy expression:\n\nTake the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:\n\nReplace:\n\nAnd simplify:\n\nTo express dU in terms of dT and dV, the term\n\nis substituted in the fundamental thermodynamic relation\n\nThis gives:\n\nThe term formula_30 is the heat capacity at constant volume formula_31\n\nThe partial derivative of \"S\" with respect to \"V\" can be evaluated if the equation of state is known. From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that the differential of the Helmholtz free energy A is given by:\n\nThe symmetry of second derivatives of \"A\" with respect to \"T\" and \"V\" yields the Maxwell relation:\n\nThis gives the expression above.\nWhen dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:\n\nwhere it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is related to the heat capacity at constant volume according to:\n\nThe partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant volume can be expressed in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion \n\nand the isothermal compressibility\n\nby writing:\n\nand equating dV to zero and solving for the ratio dp/dT. This gives:\n\nSubstituting (2) and (3) in (1) gives the above expression.\nThe internal pressure is defined as a partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to the volume at constant temperature:\n\nIn addition to including the entropy \"S\" and volume \"V\" terms in the internal energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or chemical species it contains:\n\nwhere \"N\" are the molar amounts of constituents of type \"j\" in the system. The internal energy is an extensive function of the extensive variables \"S\", \"V\", and the amounts \"N\", the internal energy may be written as a linearly homogeneous function of first degree:\nwhere Œ± is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential internal energy may be written as\nformula_43\n\nwhich shows (or defines) temperature \"T\" to be the partial derivative of \"U\" with respect to entropy \"S\" and pressure \"p\" to be the negative of the similar derivative with respect to volume \"V\"\nformula_9\nformula_10\n\nand where the coefficients formula_46 are the chemical potentials for the components of type i in the system. The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the energy with respect to the variations in composition:\nAs conjugate variables to the composition formula_48, the chemical potentials are intensive properties, intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant \"T\" and \"p\", because of the extensive nature of U and its independent variables, using Euler's homogeneous function theorem, the differential d\"U\" may be integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:\n\nThe sum over the composition of the system is the Gibbs free energy:\nthat arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the original definition of the unit for formula_48.\n\nFor an elastic medium the mechanical energy term of the internal energy must be replaced by the more general expression involving the stress formula_52 and strain formula_53. The infinitesimal statement is:\n\nwhere Einstein notation has been used for the tensors, in which there is a summation over all repeated indices in the product term. \nThe Euler theorem yields for the internal energy:\n\nFor a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by:\n\nwhere the \"C\" are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of the medium.\n\nJames Joule studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He observed that if he did mechanical work on a fluid, such as water, by agitating the fluid, its temperature increased. He proposed that the mechanical work he was doing on the system was converted to \"thermal energy\". Specifically, he found that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "374220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374220", "title": "Inverse trigonometric functions", "text": "Inverse trigonometric functions\n\nIn mathematics, the inverse trigonometric functions (occasionally also called arcus functions, antitrigonometric functions or cyclometric functions) are the inverse functions of the trigonometric functions (with suitably restricted domains). Specifically, they are the inverses of the sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in engineering, navigation, physics, and geometry.\n\nThere are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix, e.g., , , , etc. This convention is used throughout the article.\nWhen measuring in radians, an angle of Œ∏ radians will correspond to an arc whose length is rŒ∏, where r is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the unit circle, \"the arc whose cosine is x\" is the same as \"the angle whose cosine is x\", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians. Similarly, in computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called asin, acos, atan.\n\nThe notations , , , etc., as introduced by John Herschel in 1813, are often used as well in British sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an inverse function. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like , which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between multiplicative inverse and compositional inverse. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name‚Äîfor example, = . Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity. Another convention used by a few authors is to use a majuscule (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a ‚àí1 superscript, e.g., , , , etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by , , etc. Since 2009, the ISO 80000-2 standard has removed the ambiguity by specifying solely the \"arc\" prefix for the inverse functions.\n\nSince none of the six trigonometric functions are one-to-one, they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore the ranges of the inverse functions are proper subsets of the domains of the original functions.\n\nFor example, using \"function\" in the sense of multivalued functions, just as the square root function could be defined from , the function is defined so that sin(\"y\") = \"x\". For a given real number \"x\", with ‚àí1 ‚â§ \"x\" ‚â§ 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers \"y\" such that ; for example, , but also , , etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its principal branch. With this restriction, for each \"x\" in the domain the expression will evaluate only to a single value, called its principal value. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.\n\nThe principal inverses are listed in the following table.\n\nIf \"x\" is allowed to be a complex number, then the range of \"y\" applies only to its real part.\n\nTrigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1, and another side of length \"x\" (any real number between 0 and 1), then applying the Pythagorean theorem and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.\n\nComplementary angles:\n\nNegative arguments:\n\nReciprocal arguments:\n\nIf you only have a fragment of a sine table:\n\nWhenever the square root of a complex number is used here, we choose the root with the positive real part (or positive imaginary part if the square was negative real).\n\nFrom the half-angle formula, formula_5, we get:\n\nThis is derived from the tangent addition formula\nby letting\n\nThe derivatives for complex values of \"z\" are as follows:\nOnly for real values of \"x\":\n\nInverse trigonometric functions are useful when trying to determine the remaining two angles of a right triangle when the lengths of the sides of the triangle are known. Recalling the right-triangle definitions of sine and cosine, it follows that\n\nOften, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the Pythagorean Theorem: formula_20 where formula_21 is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.\n\nFor example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle \"Œ∏\" with the horizontal, where \"Œ∏\" may be computed as follows:\n\nThe two-argument atan2 function computes the arctangent of \"y\" / \"x\" given \"y\" and \"x\", but with a range of (‚àí,¬†]. In other words, atan2(\"y\",¬†\"x\") is the angle between the positive \"x\"-axis of a plane and the point (\"x\",¬†\"y\") on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, \"y\"¬†>¬†0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, \"y\"¬†<¬†0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.\nIn terms of the standard arctan function, that is with range of (‚àí, ), it can be expressed as follows:\n\nIt also equals the principal value of the argument of the complex number \"x\"¬†+¬†i\"y\".\n\nThis function may also be defined using the tangent half-angle formulae as follows:\nprovided that either \"x\"¬†>¬†0 or \"y\"¬†‚â†¬†0. However this fails if given x¬†‚â§¬†0 and y¬†=¬†0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.\n\nThe above argument order (\"y\", \"x\") seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in ISO standards such as the C programming language, but a few authors may use the opposite convention (\"x\", \"y\") so some caution is warranted. These variations are detailed at atan2.\n\nIn many applications the solution formula_26 of the equation formula_27 is to come as close as possible to a given value formula_28. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function \nThe function formula_30 rounds to the nearest integer.\n\nFor angles near 0 and , arccosine is ill-conditioned and will thus calculate the angle with reduced accuracy in a computer implementation (due to the limited number of digits). Similarly, arcsine is inaccurate for angles near ‚àí/2 and /2.\n\n\n"}

It dates back to the work of Doris Lester and Muriel Lester, who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for \"educational, social and recreational\" purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built on Powis Road, with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on July 14, 1927. An additional Church and community centre has also been built on Parslows Ave. Dagenham. This also holds the Kingsley Hall name and is undergoing redevelopment.\n\nDuring the General Strike of 1926, Kingsley Hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Mohandas Gandhi stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the Gandhi Foundation. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the Jarrow March stayed at the Hall.\n\nIn 1965 R. D. Laing and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the Philadelphia Association was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by schizophrenia.\nThe idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by Mary Barnes a former nurse and first resident as patient.\n\nThe hall was designated a Grade II listed building in September 1973.\n\nIn 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one shilling (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person ‚Äì the mind, body and spirit ‚Äì in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.\n\nKingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards \"educational, social and recreational\" purposes. Doris and Muriel Lester bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a \"people's house\", where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for \"worship, study, fun and friendship\". The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.\n\nDuring World War I, in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for Air Raid Wardens. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the House of Commons demanding that milk be sent to Germany, where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.\n\nAfter the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the Suffragettes in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in Victoria Park. After her talks local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an Alderman on the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.\n\nThe Lester's father, Henry Lester, was a shipbuilder. He bought a cottage in Loughton, (then a countryside district of Essex), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, \"Rachel Cottage\" also served to provide holidays for nursery children.\n\nEnough money was saved to build the Children's House on Bruce Road which was opened by H.G. Wells in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The \"Children's House\" continues to be run as a Nursery School.\n\nDuring the 1926 General Strike, the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodations were needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was Charles Cowles Voysey.\n\nA Stone-laying ceremony took place on July 14, 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.\n\n\nKingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on September 15, 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space of worship. \n\nThe new building would receive its most famous visitor just a few years after it opened. In 1931 Mahatma Gandhi accepted an invitation to stay there while on his visit to England. \n\"The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall...when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.\"\n\"...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way... There was something about him that always lives with the people.\"\n\nGandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat however, were pure press invention. Among Gandhi's visitors were Charlie Chaplin, George Bernard Shaw, the Pearly King and Queen of east London, many politicians including David Lloyd George and the Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang. Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.\n\nIn 1935 Ellen Wilkinson led the Jarrow March to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a \"Freeman of the Borough of Poplar\" on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.\n\nFollowing World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.\n\nIn 1965 R. D. Laing and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the Philadelphia Association and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry. Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos. Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.\n\nOne notable resident of this experiment was Mary Barnes. Along with resident psychiatrist Joseph Berke, Mary later went on to write \"Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness\", describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play \"Mary Barnes\" by David Edgar. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author Axel Jensen.\n\nThe activities of residents in the \"no-holds barred\" experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies it was severely damaged.\n\nIn the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film \"Gandhi\". During the filming Richard Attenborough united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.\n\nKingsley Hall was reopened 2 March 1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.\n\nIn 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interprets its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in exciting and innovatory ways.\n\n"}

It may also be used as a mark of identity in other contexts.\n\nMerchants' marks are as old as the sealings of the third millennium BCE found in Sumer that originated in the Indus Valley. Impressions of cloth, strings and other packing material on the reverse of tags with seal impressions indicate that the Harappan seals were used to control economic administration and trade. Amphorae from the Roman Empire can sometimes be traced to their sources from the inscriptions on their handles. Commercial inscriptions in Latin, known as Tituli picti, appear on Roman containers used for trade.\n\nSymbolic merchants' marks continued to be used by artisans and townspeople of the medieval and early modern eras to identify themselves and authenticate their goods. These distinctive and easily recognizable marks often appeared in their seals on documents and on products made for sale. They are often found on headstones and in works of stained glass, brass and stone, serving in place of heraldic imagery, which could not be used by the middle classes. They were the precursors of hallmarks, printer's marks and trademarks.\n\nTo manage the risks of piracy or shipwreck, merchants often consigned a cargo to several vessels or caravans; a mark on a bale established legal ownership and avoided confusion. Early travellers, voyagers and merchants displayed their merchant's marks as well to ward off evil. Adventurous travellers and sailors ascribed the terrors and perils of their life to the wrath of the Devil. To counter these dangers merchants employed all sorts of religious and magical means to place their caravans, ships and merchandise under the protection of God and His Saints.\n\nOne such symbol combined the mystical \"Sign of Four\" with the merchant's name or initials. The \"Sign of Four\" was an outgrowth of an ancient symbol adopted by the Romans and by Christianity, Chi Rho (XP), standing for the first two letters of Christus in Greek letters; this was simplified to a reversed \"4\" in Medieval times. The evolution of this symbol is shown in M. J. Shah's article. The \"Sign of Four\" is called the \"Staff of Mercury\" (Caduceus) in German and Scandinavian literature on house marks.\n\nThe joint stock company or limited liability company was another way to reduce a merchant's risks of loss of ships and merchandise from dangerous voyages and travel. By royal charter a monopoly was assured and a merchant's personal liability was limited to the amount of his own investment. If a voyage succeeded the gains accrued to all of the investors in proportion to their invested capital shares. Modern institutions, corporations and trademarks, find some of their origins in these symbolic and legal devices for limiting physical and pecuniary risks.\n\nWhen the East India Company was chartered by Elizabeth I, Queen of England in 1600 it was still customary for each merchant or Company of Merchant Adventurers to have a distinguishing mark which included the \"Sign of Four\" and served as a trademark. The East India Company's mark was made up from a '+', a '4' and the initials EIC.\n\nThis mark forms the central emblem displayed on the Scinde Dawk postage stamps. Also, it was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage.\n\n\n"}

Below are some examples of statistical tests that have been used for minimum distance estimation.\n\nThe chi-square test uses as its criterion the sum, over predefined groups, of the squared difference between the increases of the empirical distribution and the estimated distribution, weighted by the increase in the estimate for that group.\n\nThe Cram√©r‚Äìvon Mises criterion uses the integral of the squared difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions .\n\nThe Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test uses the supremum of the absolute difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions .\n\nThe Anderson‚ÄìDarling test is similar to the Cram√©r‚Äìvon Mises criterion except that the integral is of a weighted version of the squared difference, where the weighting relates the variance of the empirical distribution function .\n\nThe theory of minimum distance estimation is related to that for the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding statistical goodness of fit tests. Often the cases of the Cram√©r‚Äìvon Mises criterion, the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test and the Anderson‚ÄìDarling test are treated simultaneously by treating them as special cases of a more general formulation of a distance measure. Examples of the theoretical results that are available are: consistency of the parameter estimates; the asymptotic covariance matrices of the parameter estimates.\n\n\n"}

It was introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and now has many variants and generalisations, among them the ƒåech nerve of a cover, which in turn is generalised by hypercoverings.\nGiven an index set \"I\", and open sets \"U contained in \"X\", the \"nerve\" \"N\" is the set of finite subsets of \"I\" defined as follows:\n\nObviously, if \"J\" belongs to \"N\", then any of its subsets is also in \"N\". Therefore \"N\" is an abstract simplicial complex.\n\nIn general, the complex \"N\" need not reflect the topology of \"X\" accurately. For example we can cover any \"n\"-sphere with two contractible sets \"U\" and \"V\", in such a way that \"N\" is an abstract 1-simplex. However, if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every intersection indexed by a set in \"N\" are also contractible, the situation changes. In particular, the nerve lemma states that if formula_2 is a good cover, in that for each formula_3, the set formula_4 is contractible if it is nonempty, then the nerve formula_5 is homotopy equivalent to formula_6. \n\nThis means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs, intersecting in pairs in one arc, is modelled by a homeomorphic complex, the geometrical realization of \"N\".\n\nGiven an open cover formula_7 of a topological space formula_8, or more generally a cover in a site, we can regard the pairwise fibre products formula_9, which in the case of a topological space is precisely the intersection formula_10. The collection of all such intersections can be referred to as formula_11 and the triple intersections as formula_12. By considering the natural maps formula_13 and formula_14, we can construct a simplicial object formula_15 defined by formula_16, n-fold fibre product. This is the ƒåech nerve, and by taking connected components we get a simplicial set, which we can realise topologically: formula_17. If the covering and the space are sufficiently nice, for instance if formula_8 is compact and all intersections of sets in the cover are contractible or empty, then this space is weakly equivalent to formula_8. This is known as \"the nerve theorem\".\n\n"}

These effects include reduced productivity, constraints in areas of work, and public perception of expertise in areas unrelated to the laureate's work. The term Nobel effect is also used in those contexts, as well as in the context of the winner's longevity, and influence on international law in the case of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe definition of the \"Nobel Prize effect\" most attributed to Richard Hamming describes the effect as a reduction in productivity, making it hard for a scientist to work on small problems after winning the prize. During a speech at a seminar, Hamming described a scene at the Nobel awards ceremony as follows:\n\nThe Nobel Prize effect is also described as a consequence of public perception of the Nobel laureate, magnified by the worldwide exposure the winner experiences. One example is for the Nobel laureate to be treated with reverence due to perception that the laureate has authoritative knowledge about any subject outside the field in which he or she won the prize. Nobel Laureate Klaus von Klitzing describes the effect as a personal burden, because other people have a tendency to believe that a Nobel Prize winner's knowledge extends to all areas. At the same time, he acknowledges that this is also a benefit, because people in positions of authority will pay attention to the views of Nobel laureates. As physicist Hubert Curien described the phenomenon in a Natural Environment Research Council lecture:\nAnother example of the effect of new public perception is when the works of the Nobel Laureate suddenly become popular and in demand due to the fame that the Nobel Prize confers on the winner. Canadian author Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature, suddenly found herself with a Chinese audience with such strong demands for her works that they quickly sold out, and two publishers in China became embroiled in a dispute over publication rights.\n\nPerception among colleagues in the same discipline was thought to have a measurable effect on how often the Nobel laureate's works are cited before and after winning the prize. While a simple comparison of citation counts before and after the prize does suggest an impact, a study using matched synthetic control group in the analysis suggest that there is no such effect on either citation impact or related chain reactions of citations.\n\nIn addition to the life-changing effects of winning a Nobel prize, an alternative meaning exists for the Nobel effect in the context of the Nobel Peace Prize. In this context, legal scholars have argued whether Nobel Peace Prize laureates have, as a result of winning the Prize, influenced the shaping of new norms in international law and international relations, and suggesting that the Peace Prize can be a significant factor in encouraging peacemaking among individuals worldwide.\n\nAn analysis of birth data on 19th century science Nobel Prize winners estimated that winning the Nobel Prize correlated with one or two years of additional longevity for the recipient, compared to being merely nominated for the prize.\n"}

{"id": "35964751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35964751", "title": "Out of Asia theory", "text": "Out of Asia theory\n\nThe Out of Asia theory was a scientific theory which contended that modern humans first arose in Asia. Most anthropologists until the mid 20th century preferred Asia, over Africa, as the continent where the first hominids evolved. The recent African origin of modern humans (\"Out of Africa\") theory is currently supported by more data.\n\nBecause of the rise of evolutionary thought in the late 19th century the out of Asia theory gained many new proponents, many of whom believed that the missing link would be found in Asia. Scientists such as Ernst Haeckel, Eugene Dubois, Henry Fairfield Osborn and Roy Chapman Andrews all thought Asia was where the major events of evolution had occurred.\n\nErnst Haeckel, the German evolutionary biologist, believed that Hindustan (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of Africa.\n\nHaeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the lost continent of Lemuria located in the Indian Ocean. He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans, that Asia was the home of many of the earliest primates, and thus Asia was the cradle of hominin evolution. Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.\n\nEug√®ne Dubois, a Dutch paleoanthropologist and proponent of the out of Asia theory, discovered the skeletal remains of the first representative \"Homo erectus\" found in Java in 1891 on the banks of Solo River, East Java, Indonesia. The find later became known as Java man.\n\nLater, the discovery of Peking man persuaded anthropologists up until the 1930s that Asia was most likely the cradle of the human species. William Boyd Dawkins wrote that the tropical region of Asia was \"the probable birthplace of the human race\". The British anthropologist Alfred Cort Haddon wrote \"There is reason to believe that mankind did not originate in Africa; but that all the main races in that continent reached it from Southern Asia\".\n\nApart from Eugene Dubois, very few of the early human origin theorists actually visited Asia to see if their ideas were valid or not. This changed in the 1920s as a well-funded expedition was carried out in Asia called The Central Asiatic Expeditions. The expedition, led by Roy Chapman Andrews, visited parts of Central Asia including China and Mongolia to search for the origins of humankind.\n\nPaleontologists who believed humans originated in Asia also include Johan Gunnar Andersson, Otto Zdansky and Walter W. Granger. All three of these scientists were known for visiting China and for their work and discoveries by excavating the sites at Zhoukoudian that yielded remains of so-called Peking man (\"Homo erectus pekinensis\"). Further funding for the excavations was carried out by Davidson Black a key proponent of the out of Asia theory. Because of the finds in Zhoukoudian, such as Peking Man, the focus of paleoanthropological research moved entirely to Asia, up until 1930.\n\nThe explorer Roy Chapman Andrews along with Henry Fairfield Osborn led several expeditions to North China and Mongolia from 1922 to 1928 known as the \"Central Asiatic Expeditions\" setting out to try to find the earliest human remains in Asia, however Andrews and his team found many other finds, such as dinosaur bones and fossil mammals and most notably the first known dinosaur nests full of eggs. Andrews' main account of these expeditions can be found in his book \"The New Conquest of Central Asia\".\n\nIn Andrews' 1926 book \"On the Trail of the Ancient Man\", Henry Fairfield Osborn noted in the preface that the birthplace of modern humans would be found in Asia and that he had predicted it decades earlier even before the Asiatic expeditions were carried out. Another key proponent of the out of Asia theory of this era was William Diller Matthew who also took part in the Central Asiatic expeditions; Matthew was well known for his deeply influential 1915 article \"Climate and evolution\". Matthew's theory was that climate change was how organisms came to live where we find them today in opposition to the theory of continental drift. His basic premise was that cyclical changes in global climate along with the prevailing tendency for mammals to disperse from north to south account for the odd geographic patterns of living mammals, he believed that humans and many other groups of modern mammals first evolved in the northern areas of the globe, especially central Asia because of the shifting climatic circumstances, Matthew firmly placed hominid origins in central Asia as he claimed that the high plateaux of Tibet was the forcing ground of mammalian evolution.\n\nLater defenders of the out of Asia theory included Henry Fairfield Osborn, Davidson Black, and William King Gregory. Henry Fairfield Osborn was best known for his Dawn Man theory of human origins which he wrote would be found in Tibet and Mongolia. Osborn firmly believed that Asia had been the cradle of humankind. Davidson Black writing a paper in 1925 titled \"Asia and the dispersal of primates\" wrote that the origins of man were to be found in Tibet, British India, the Yung-Ling, and the Tarim Basin of China. His last paper published in 1934 before his death argued for human origins in an Eastern Asian context. William King Gregory also wrote that the Tarim Desert is the most likely place for human origins.\n\nVon Koenigswald who found the first \"Gigantopithecus\" tooth in Hong Kong in 1935, continued to support the out of Asia theory.\n\nThe out of Asia theory later fell into decline, one of the reasons was because Franz Weidenreich merged the Asia hypothesis into the multiregional origin of modern humans, extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with gene flow between various populations which influenced many anthropologists of the time.\n\nThe last support for the out of Asia theory was due to the finds of fossils such as the \"Dryopithecus\" and \"Ramapithecus\" in Eurasia up until the early 1980s. One of the last advocates of the out of Asia theory was Jia Lanpo who argued that the cradle of humanity had been in Southwest China, up until his death in 2001. Scholar Sigrid Schmalzer in her book \"The People's Peking man\" claims the only modern advocates of the out of Asia theory have their beliefs firmly rooted in Chinese Nationalism.\n\nThere are still claims in favor of Out of Asia from modern molecular genetics research.\n"}

However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith.\nWith reference to international agreements, \"every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\" \"Pacta sunt servanda\" is related to good faith, while pacta sunt servanda does not equate with good faith . This entitles states to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty cannot invoke provisions of its municipal (domestic) law as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the UNIDROIT Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.\n\nThe only limit to \"pacta sunt servanda\" are the peremptory norms of general international law, called \"jus cogens\" (compelling law). The legal principle \"clausula rebus sic stantibus\", part of customary international law, also allows for treaty obligations to be unfulfilled due to a compelling change in circumstances.\n\n\n\n"}

Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save Spinozism.\n\nJacobi's \"√úber die Lehre des Spinozas\" (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the Berlin group, led by Moses Mendelssohn. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between theism and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which Immanuel Kant rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to antinomies in thought.\n\nJacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a pietist, and as a Jesuit in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term \"Glaube\" (German: \"belief, faith\"). \n\nWilli Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.\n\nThe Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of nihilism and claims that God is dead.\n\nJacobi's next important work, \"David Hume √úber den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus\" (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term \"Glaube\" had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the \"Letters on Spinoza\", but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the critical philosophy, and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.\n\nThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\n\n"}
{"id": "14854040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14854040", "title": "Parataxic distortion", "text": "Parataxic distortion\n\nParataxic distortion is a psychiatric term first used by Harry S. Sullivan to describe the inclination to skew perceptions of others based on fantasy. The \"distortion\" is a faulty perception of others, based not on actual experience with the other individual, but on a projected fantasy personality attributed to the individual. For example, when one falls in love, an image of another person as the ‚Äúperfect match‚Äù or ‚Äúsoul mate‚Äù can be created when in reality, the other person may not live up to these expectations or embody the imagined traits at all. \n\nThe fantasy personality is created in part from past experiences and from expectations as to how the person 'should be', and is formulated in response to emotional stress. This stress can originate from the formation of a new relationship, or from cognitive dissonance required to maintain an existing relationship. Parataxic distortion serves as an immature cognitive defense mechanism against this psychological stress and is similar to Transference.\n\nParataxic distortion is difficult to avoid because of the nature of human learning and interaction. Stereotyping of individuals based on social cues and the classification of people into groups is a commonplace cognitive function of the human mind. Such pigeonholing allows for a person to gain a quick, though possibly inaccurate, assessment of an interaction. The cognitive processes employed, however, can have a distorting effect on the clear understanding of individuals. In essence, one can lose the ability to 'hear the other' through one's own projected beliefs of what the other person is saying.\n\nFrom the Greek œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨œÑŒ±ŒæŒπœÇ, \"placement side by side\" \n\nPara - A Greek prefix which came to designate objects or activities auxiliary to or derivative of that denoted by the base word ( parody; paronomasia, paranoia) and hence abnormal or defective.\nTaxic - indicating movement towards or away from a specified stimulus.\n\nIn this sense, Parataxic distortion, is a shift in perception away from reality.\n\nDistorting one's perception of others can often interfere with interpersonal relationships. In many cases, however, it may be beneficial to do so. Humans are constantly and subconsciously stereotyping. According to Paul Martin Lester, \"our brains naturally classify what we see, we can't help but notice the differences in physical attributes between one person and another.\" Parataxic distortion runs parallel to stereotyping while it remains in the subconscious. As we make quick judgments, we are drawing from previous experiences stored in our memory.\n\nParataxic distortion can be a beneficial defense mechanism for the individual, allowing the individual to maintain relationships with others with whom he or she would otherwise be unable to interact or allowing the individual to endure difficult periods in relationships. A self-imposed blindness to certain personality traits can keep a relationship healthy, or it can also prove destructive. For instance, parataxic distortion can keep one in denial of the abusive nature of a spouse.\n\nParataxic distortion can begin in the early stages of development in infants. A mother‚Äôs nurturing personality and emotional warmth might be projected onto a lover later in life. This could initially generate stronger feelings for the woman than are warranted by her behavior and character alone. This example of attachment theory correlates with Parataxic Distortion.\n\nAttachment theory would have it that the fantasy selves projected onto others in parataxic distortion are informed by our long-term attachment patterns. Not only are these imagined traits the resultant of our earliest bonds and unresolved emotional issues from past relationships, but they are recreated in these fantasy selves for the purpose of recreating that past attachment in the present.\n\nDealing with current situations or people that relate to a past event, or remind someone of a person from the past, can have negative effects on a human from an emotional standpoint. If the person from the past was a negative figure or the past event had a negative influence on a person, the person may create a self-sense of identity for the new individual they met. The negative emotional response happens when the individual realizes that they have been creating a fake identity for the new individual. \n\nParataxic distortion is most effective in the realm of interpersonal communication. Parataxic distortion is typically used to avoid coping with past events. For example, if a child is mistreated by his or her father, the child may not only attach the fear and anger towards the father but will also relate this fear and anger to other men that look, talk or act like the father. The human mind keeps track of situations that we have encountered in the past to help us deal with future situations. The unconscious memory, without our knowing, helps us understand and deal with situations in the present that we have dealt with in the past. Parataxic distortion and our unconscious mind make us act the same way in current situations as we did in the past, even without realizing it.\n\nAs a defense mechanism, parataxic distortion protects one from the emotional consequences of a past event. A person may not remember a certain event, or be acting on it consciously, but will act a certain way to protect themselves from an outcome with the use of parataxic distortion. This behavior is a pathological attempt to cope with reality by using unreality.\n\nParataxic distortion is a commonly used psychological defense mechanism. It is not an illness or a disease, but a part of everyday, normal human psychology that can become maladaptive in certain situations. The cognitive abilities used to generate internal models of others are useful in interaction. As we can never truly internalize the full reality of another, we must interact with a shorthand version of them. It's only when we believe that the shorthand version is their reality that this ability can become maladaptive. One may also attempt to coerce or force another to 'fit the mold' and act more according to expectations, more like the idealized version they dream the other as being. This is also pathological. \n\nHowever, all humans engage in parataxic distortion to one extent or another, in one realm or another. It may be to manage emotions within their family, to facilitate communication between them and their spouse, or to imagine a relationship between them and their nation-state.\n\n\n"}

In 1953 the gangster Lucky Luciano complained in an interview to Safire that \"I been a political football\". \n\nA less-used meaning, is a political issue that is continually debated but left unresolved. The term is often used during a political election campaign to highlight issues that have not been completely addressed, such as the natural environment and abortion.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has English examples of the use of \"football\" (the ball, not the game) in a figurative sense for something helplessly tossed around by others as early as the 16th century, for example, from about 1600: \"I am the verye foote-ball of the starres\". The phrase is used by the \"Bangor, Maine Whig and Courier\" in 1857. An American cartoon from the time of President Harrison in 1889 shows a clear visual illustration of the metaphor, without using the actual phrase. It is now equally popular in other English-speaking countries, where the association is naturally with association football (\"soccer\") or the predominant local form of football.\n\nMany other American football terms are in common use in the United States. Once a topic or issue has presented itself, the opposition will take the issue and \"run with it\" and \"try to score points\". There may be many parties in opposition to take up the topic, and sometimes run it into the ground, which at times can \"backfire\" and end up hurting the opposing faction. This can happen to the point of that party being seen as \"fumbling\" the issue. When a party or candidate ends up ignoring or putting off the issue, they are said to be \"punting\" it. In addition to the opponents of the politician or party using the subject as political fuel, the media may also \"run with it\". \"Moving the goalposts\" is the practice of changing the criteria of something while it is in progress (such as an investigation or a hearing) in order to offer one side an inherent advantage or disadvantage. Sometimes these matters become larger, like during an election, than anyone would have thought possible during the event itself.\n\nOther countries also use metaphors drawn from their local sport in discussing politics, such as soccer, Australian rules football, baseball, rugby union/rugby league or cricket.\n\n"}
{"id": "485862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=485862", "title": "Primitive ring", "text": "Primitive ring\n\nIn the branch of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a left primitive ring is a ring which has a faithful simple left module. Well known examples include endomorphism rings of vector spaces and Weyl algebras over fields of characteristic zero.\n\nA ring \"R\" is said to be a left primitive ring if and only if it has a faithful simple left \"R\"-module. A right primitive ring is defined similarly with right \"R\"-modules. There are rings which are primitive on one side but not on the other. The first example was constructed by George M. Bergman in . Another example found by Jategaonkar showing the distinction can be found in \n\nAn internal characterization of left primitive rings is as follows: a ring is left primitive if and only if there is a maximal left ideal containing no nonzero two-sided ideals. The analogous definition for right primitive rings is also valid.\n\nThe structure of left primitive rings is completely determined by the Jacobson density theorem: A ring is left primitive if and only if it is isomorphic to a dense subring of the ring of endomorphisms of a left vector space over a division ring.\n\nAnother equivalent definition states that a ring is left primitive if and only if it is a prime ring with a faithful left module of finite length (, Ex.¬†11.19, p.¬†191).\n\nOne sided primitive rings are both semiprimitive rings and prime rings. Since the ring product of two or more nonzero rings is not prime, it is clear that the product of primitive rings is never primitive. \n\nFor a left Artinian ring, it is known that the conditions \"left primitive\", \"right primitive\", \"prime\", and \"simple\" are all equivalent, and in this case it is a semisimple ring isomorphic to a square matrix ring over a division ring. More generally, in any ring with a minimal one sided ideal, \"left primitive\"=\"right primitive\"=\"prime\".\n\nA commutative ring is left primitive if and only if it is a field.\n\nBeing left primitive is a Morita invariant property.\n\nEvery simple ring \"R\" with unity is both left and right primitive. (However, a simple non-unital ring may not be primitive.) This follows from the fact that \"R\" has a maximal left ideal \"M\", and the fact that the quotient module \"R\"/\"M\" is a simple left \"R\"-module, and that its annihilator is a proper two-sided ideal in \"R\". Since \"R\" is a simple ring, this annihilator is {0} and therefore \"R\"/\"M\" is a faithful left \"R\"-module.\n\nWeyl algebras over fields with characteristic zero are primitive, and since they are domains, they are examples without minimal one-sided ideals.\n\nA special case of primitive rings is that of \"full linear rings\". A left full linear ring is the ring of \"all\" linear transformations of an infinite dimensional left vector space over a division ring. (A right full linear ring differs by using a right vector space instead.) In symbols, formula_1 where \"V\" is a vector space over a division ring \"D\". It is known that \"R\" is a left full linear ring if and only if \"R\" is von Neumann regular, left self-injective with socle soc(\"R\")‚â†{0}. Through linear algebra arguments, it can be shown that formula_2 is isomorphic to the ring of row finite matrices formula_3, where \"I\" is an index set whose size is the dimension of \"V\" over \"D\". Likewise right full linear rings can be realized as column finite matrices over \"D\".\n\nUsing this we can see that there are non-simple left primitive rings. By the Jacobson Density characterization, a left full linear ring \"R\" is always left primitive. When dim\"V\" is finite \"R\" is a square matrix ring over \"D\", but when dim\"V\" is infinite, the set of finite rank linear transformations is a proper two-sided ideal of \"R\", and hence \"R\" is not simple.\n\n"}
{"id": "35456546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35456546", "title": "Ricci calculus", "text": "Ricci calculus\n\nIn mathematics, Ricci calculus constitutes the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields. It is also the modern name for what used to be called the absolute differential calculus (the foundation of tensor calculus), developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro in 1887‚Äì1896, and subsequently popularized in a paper written with his pupil Tullio Levi-Civita in 1900. Jan Arnoldus Schouten developed the modern notation and formalism for this mathematical framework, and made contributions to the theory, during its applications to general relativity and differential geometry in the early twentieth century.\n\nA component of a tensor is a real number that is used as a coefficient of a basis element for the tensor space. The tensor is the sum of its components multiplied by their corresponding basis elements. Tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of their components, and operations on tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of operations on their components. The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus. This notation allows an efficient expression of such tensor fields and operations. While much of the notation may be applied with any tensors, operations relating to a differential structure are only applicable to tensor fields. Where needed, the notation extends to components of non-tensors, particularly multidimensional arrays.\n\nA tensor may be expressed as a linear sum of the tensor product of vector and covector basis elements. The resulting tensor components are labelled by indices of the basis. Each index has one possible value per dimension of the underlying vector space. The number of indices equals the degree (or order) of the tensor.\n\nFor compactness and convenience, the notational convention implies summation over indices repeated within a term and universal quantification over free indices. Expressions in the notation of the Ricci calculus may generally be interpreted as a set of simultaneous equations relating the components as functions over a manifold, usually more specifically as functions of the coordinates on the manifold. This allows intuitive manipulation of expressions with familiarity of only a limited set of rules.\n\nWhere a distinction is to be made between the space-like basis elements and a time-like element in the four-dimensional spacetime of classical physics, this is conventionally done through indices as follows:\n\nSome sources use 4 instead of 0 as the index value corresponding to time; in this article, 0 is used. Otherwise, in general mathematical contexts, any symbols can be used for the indices, generally running over all dimensions of the vector space.\n\nThe author(s) will usually make it clear whether a subscript is intended as an index or as a label.\n\nFor example, in 3-D Euclidean space and using Cartesian coordinates; the coordinate vector shows a direct correspondence between the subscripts 1, 2, 3 and the labels . In the expression , is interpreted as an index ranging over the values 1, 2, 3, while the subscripts are not variable indices, more like \"names\" for the components. In the context of spacetime, the index value 0 conventionally corresponds to the label .\n\nIndices themselves may be \"labelled\" using diacritic-like symbols, such as a hat (ÀÜ), bar (¬Ø), tilde (Àú), or prime (‚Ä≤) as in:\n\nto denote a possibly different basis for that index. An example is in Lorentz transformations from one frame of reference to another, where one frame could be unprimed and the other primed, as in:\n\nThis is not to be confused with van der Waerden notation for spinors, which uses hats and overdots on indices to reflect the chirality of a spinor.\n\nA \"lower index\" (subscript) indicates covariance of the components with respect to that index:\n\nAn \"upper index\" (superscript) indicates contravariance of the components with respect to that index:\n\nA tensor may have both upper and lower indices:\n\nOrdering of indices is significant, even when of differing variance. However, when it is understood that no indices will be raised or lowered while retaining the base symbol, covariant indices are sometimes placed below contravariant indices for notational convenience (e.g. with the generalized Kronecker delta).\n\nThe number of each upper and lower indices of a tensor gives its \"type\": a tensor with upper and lower indices is said to be of type , or to be a type- tensor.\n\nThe number of indices of a tensor, regardless of variance, is called the \"degree\" of the tensor (alternatively, its \"valence\", \"order\" or \"rank\", although \"rank\" is ambiguous). Thus, a tensor of type has degree .\n\nThe same symbol occurring twice (one upper and one lower) within a term indicates a pair of indices that are summed over:\n\nThe operation implied by such a summation is called tensor contraction:\n\nThis summation may occur more than once within a term with a distinct symbol per pair of indices, for example:\n\nOther combinations of repeated indices within a term are considered to be ill-formed, such as\n\nsince they are meaningless: they do not transform as tensors under a change of basis.\n\nIf a tensor has a list of all upper or lower indices, one shorthand is to use a capital letter for the list:\n\nwhere and .\n\nA pair of vertical bars around a set of all-upper indices or all-lower indices, associated with contraction with another set of indices:\n\nHere the and indices are antisymmetrized, is not.\n\nAny tensor can be written as the sum of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts on two indices:\n\nas can be seen by adding the above expressions for and . This does not hold for other than two indices.\n\nFor compactness, derivatives may be indicated by adding indices after a comma or semicolon.\n\nWhile most of the expressions of the Ricci calculus are valid for arbitrary bases, the expressions involving partial derivatives of tensor coordinated apply only with a coordinate basis: a basis that is defined through differentiation of the coordinates. Coordinates are typically denoted by , but do not in general form the components of a vector. In flat spacetime with linear coordinatization, a tuple of \"differences\" in coordinates, , can be treated as a contravariant vector. With the same constraints on the space and on the choice of coordinate system, the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates yield a result that is effectively covariant. Aside from use in this special case, the partial derivatives of components of tensors are useful in building expressions that are covariant, albeit still with a coordinate basis if the partial derivatives are explicitly used, as with the covariant and Lie derivatives below.\n\nTo indicate partial differentiation of the components of a tensor field with respect to a coordinate variable , a \"comma\" is placed before an appended lower index of the coordinate variable.\n\nThis may be repeated (without adding further commas):\n\nThese components do \"not\" transform covariantly, unless the expression being differentiated is a scalar. This derivative is characterized by the product rule and the derivatives of the coordinates\n\nwhere is the Kronecker delta.\n\nTo indicate covariant differentiation of any tensor field, a \"semicolon\" () is placed before an appended lower (covariant) index. Less common alternatives to the semicolon include a \"forward slash\" () or in three-dimensional curved space a single vertical bar ().\n\nFor a contravariant vector, its covariant derivative is:\nwhere is a Christoffel symbol of the second kind.\n\nFor a covariant vector, its covariant derivative is:\n\nFor an arbitrary tensor:\n\nThe components of this derivative of a tensor field transform covariantly, and hence form another tensor field. This derivative is characterized by the product rule and applied to the metric tensor it gives zero:\n\nThe covariant formulation of the directional derivative of any tensor field along a vector may be expressed as its contraction with the covariant derivative, e.g.:\n\nOne alternative notation for the covariant derivative of any tensor is the subscripted nabla symbol . For the case of a vector field :\n\nThe Lie derivative is another derivative that is covariant, but which should not be confused with the \"covariant derivative\". It is defined even in the absence of a metric tensor. The Lie derivative of a type tensor field along (the flow of) a contravariant vector field may be expressed as\n\nThis derivative is characterized by the product rule and the fact that the derivative of the given contravariant vector field is zero.\n\nThe Lie derivative of a type relative tensor field of weight along (the flow of) a contravariant vector field may be expressed as\n\nThe Kronecker delta is like the identity matrix\n\nwhen multiplied and contracted. The components are the same in any basis and form an invariant tensor of type , i.e. the identity of the tangent bundle over the identity mapping of the base manifold, and so its trace is an invariant.\nIts trace is the dimensionality of the space; for example, in four-dimensional spacetime,\n\nThe Kronecker delta is one of the family of generalized Kronecker deltas. The generalized Kronecker delta of degree may be defined in terms of the Kronecker delta by (a common definition includes an additional multiplier of on the right):\nand acts as an antisymmetrizer on indices:\n\nThe metric tensor is used for lowering indices and gives the length of any space-like curve\n\nwhere is any smooth strictly monotone parameterization of the path. It also gives the duration of any time-like curve\n\nwhere is any smooth strictly monotone parameterization of the trajectory. See also line element.\n\nThe inverse matrix of the metric tensor is another important tensor, used for raising indices:\n\nIf this tensor is defined as\n\nthen it is the commutator of the covariant derivative with itself:\n\nsince the connection is torsionless, which means that the torsion tensor\nvanishes.\n\nThis can be generalized to get the commutator for two covariant derivatives of an arbitrary tensor as follows:\nwhich are often referred to as the \"Ricci identities\".\n\n\n"}

From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of rugby within South Africa drew frequent controversy. South Africa remained a member of the International Rugby Board (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.\n\nHalt All Racist Tours was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981. South Africa were excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 All Blacks rugby tour allowed MƒÅori to go under the status of 'honorary whites'.\n\nNo other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with rugby league over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.\n\nThe issue affected not only black South Africans, but also indigenous New Zealanders and to a lesser extent indigenous Australians. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as would be frowned upon.\n\nThe famous Scottish rugby commentator, Bill McLaren, devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, \"Talking of Rugby\", called \"Barred from the International Feast\". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's \"\"unacceptable racist policy\", but adds \"it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.\"\"\n\nIan Robertson, documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity:\n\nApartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was to New Zealand in 1981.\n\nLike most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:\n\n\nThere was also the South African Rugby Union (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership. However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.\n\nThe British and Irish Lions were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.\n\nIn the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in 1955, seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in 1962, 1968, 1974 and one final one in 1980. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their 1997 tour when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.\n\nThe Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the South African Rugby Board announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's apartheid policies including a potential boycott of the 1986 Commonwealth Games and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by Clive Rowlands and coached by Mick Doyle. The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.\n\nNew Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against MƒÅori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that MƒÅori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being MƒÅori, this was agreed to, and MƒÅori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some MƒÅori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at MƒÅori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which MƒÅori were central, and MƒÅori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by PƒÅkehƒÅ (white New Zealanders).\n\nIn 1973 a proposed Springbok (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although PƒÅkehƒÅ continued to dominate the movement, MƒÅori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the patu squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.\n\nDuring and after the Tour, many MƒÅori protesters questioned PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of PƒÅkehƒÅ protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly PƒÅkehƒÅ prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nSouth Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the International Table Tennis Federation severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.\n\nIn April 2010 it was revealed by Muru Walters that in 1956 Ernest Corbett, Minister of MƒÅori Affairs, had told the MƒÅori All Blacks to deliberately lose to the Springboks \"for the future of rugby\". The MƒÅori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated MƒÅori rugby players.\n\nForeign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, Verwoerd barred a MƒÅori rugby player from touring South Africa with the All Blacks, and the tour was cancelled. New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.\n\nIn 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations.\n\nIn 1963, Lloyd McDermott, the first Australian aborigine on the team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to rugby league as a result.\n\nB. J. Vorster took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit Basil D'Oliveira, a Coloured South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, \"Dolly\" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.\n\nIan Robertson describes the scene at Murrayfield in Edinburgh in 1969:\n\nThere was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.\n\nIn March 1973, the Argentine government and the Union Argentina de Rugby had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to San Isidro Club to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to South Africa by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.\n\nSouth Africa was the indirect cause of the 1976 Olympic boycott. A New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa prompted African countries to demand that the New Zealand Olympic team be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that rugby union was not an Olympic sport and the New Zealand Rugby Union was not affiliated to the New Zealand Olympic Committee. Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.\n\nIn February, 1977, Danie Craven flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1980.\n\nFor the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.\n\nHowever, some, such as Chris Laidlaw, later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:\n\nTimes have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf ‚Äì a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.\n\nBut there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. Bill McLaren thought apartheid was \"unacceptable\", but:\n\nThough contacts were restricted after the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 by the British Lions and by France, in 1981 by Ireland, and in 1984 by England. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches in Cardiff and in London marking the IRB centenary. South Africa was excluded from the first two Rugby World Cups, in 1987 and 1991.\n\nIn 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the Falklands War.\n\nThe supposedly turned down its invitation to the 1987 Rugby World Cup, because of its distaste for the \"apartheid\" regime of South Africa. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa. Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited. In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:\n\nNo nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose \"apartheid\" in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.\n\nThe Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:\n\nOver the years, Ferasse has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the v. match in Toulouse in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7\n\nIn September 1981, was due to play the Mid-West in Chicago. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to Racine and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.\n\nIn 1989 a World XV, sanctioned by the IRB and funded by South African Breweries, played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the South African Rugby Board (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in Johannesburg .\n\nThe 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.\n\nTwo games had to be cancelled. The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at Timaru was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.\n\nThe final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the \"Crazy Biggles Test\". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets. All-Black prop Gary Knight was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.\n\nMusician Bruce Russell received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour. He was at the University of Otago at the time.\n\nIt was a tight game, with Allan Hewson, the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25‚Äì22. As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:\n\nThere will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.\n\nThe role of the NZ police also became more controversial as a result of the tour.\n\nThe NZRFU constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. Two lawyers successfully sued it, claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.\n\nA \"rebel tour\" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid. This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.\n\nThe All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the apartheid r√©gime (1990‚Äì1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers but often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.\n\nOf the 30 players who had been selected for the All Black tour, only David Kirk and John Kirwan did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments‚Äîa controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport \n\nOn their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the \"Baby Blacks\". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.\n\nThe Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.\n\nWhile many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by Union Argentina de Rugby, a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and Rhodesian ones, due to the politics of those countries. This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the \"Pumas\" to play a match in Rhodesia during the tour in South Africa.\n\nAfter his election in 1994, Nelson Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the Springboks, as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup.\n\nPrior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions Australia, who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.\n\nDuring the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France. They then met New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final at Ellis Park Stadium. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a drop goal from Joel Stransky.\n\nDuring the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the Webb Ellis Cup while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.\n\nThis was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as F.W. de Klerk later put it, \"Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans.\" Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, Winnie, accused the ANC of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.\n\nThese events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, \"Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation\", that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-apartheid South Africa. Carlin sold the film rights to Morgan Freeman. The result was the 2009 film \"Invictus\", directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43116037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43116037", "title": "Sex differences in intelligence", "text": "Sex differences in intelligence\n\nDifferences in human intelligence have long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. With the advent of the concept of \"g\" or general intelligence, many researchers have argued for no significant sex differences in \"g\" factor or general intelligence, while others have argued for greater intelligence for males, and others for females. The split view between these researchers depended on the methodology and tests they used for their claims. One study found some advantage for women in later life, while another found that male advantages on some cognitive tests are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors.\n\nSome studies have concluded that there is larger variability in male scores compared to female scores, which results in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution. Additionally, there are differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as spatial ability.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held view that men were intellectually superior to women. In 1801, Thomas Gisborne said that women were naturally suited to domestic work and not spheres suited to men such as politics, science, or business. He stated that this was because women did not possess the same level of rational thinking that men did and had naturally superior abilities in skills related to family support.\n\nIn 1875, Herbert Spencer said that women were incapable of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and had only the ability to understand issues of care. In 1925, Sigmund Freud also stated that women were less morally developed in the concept of justice and, unlike men, were more influenced by feeling than rational thought. Early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because they have smaller and lighter brains. Many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable, emotional, sensitive, and therefore not suited for political participation.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, whether men and women had equal intelligence was seen by many as a prerequisite for the granting of suffrage. Leta Hollingworth argued that women were not permitted to realize their full potential, as they were confined to the roles of child-rearing and housekeeping.\n\nDuring the early twentieth century, the scientific consensus shifted to the view that gender plays no role in intelligence. In his 1916 study of children's IQs, psychologist Lewis Terman concluded that \"the intelligence of girls, at least up to 14 years, does not differ materially from that of boys\". He did, however, find \"rather marked\" differences on a minority of tests. For example, he found boys were \"decidedly better\" in arithmetical reasoning, while girls were \"superior\" at answering comprehension questions. He also proposed that discrimination, lack of opportunity, women's responsibilities in motherhood, or emotional factors may have accounted for the fact that few women had careers in intellectual fields.\n\nAccording to the 1994 report \"\" by the American Psychological Association, \"Most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.\" Thus, there is little difference between the average IQ scores of men and women. Differences have been reported, however, in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures. Also, the variability of male scores is greater than that of females, resulting in more males than females in the top and bottom of the IQ distribution.\n\nAt one time, the overwhelming consensus was that there were no sex differences in \"g\" factor or general intelligence. However, researcher Richard Lynn challenged this consensus on two grounds:\nA 2004 meta-analysis by Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing published in 2005 found that the mean IQ of men exceeded that of women by up to 5 points on the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Lynn's findings were debated in a series of articles for \"Nature\". Jackson and Philipe Rushton found that males aged 17‚Äì18 years had an average of 3.63 IQ points in excess of their female equivalents on the Scholastic Assessment Test. Irwing (2012) found a 3-point IQ advantage for males in \"g\" from subjects aged 16‚Äì89 in the United States on the WAIS III test favoring men on the information, arithmetic, and symbol search, and favoring women on the processing speed. A 2005 study by Ian Deary, Paul Irwing, Geoff Der, and Timothy Bates, focusing on the ASVAB showed a significantly higher variance in male scores, resulting in more than twice as many men as women scoring in the top 2%. The study also found a very small (d' ‚âà 0.07, about 1 IQ point) average male advantage in \"g\" on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test. Another study by researcher Jianghong Liu also found 3 points higher male scores on the WISC, which is the children's version of the WAIS III. He stated that greater male performance on items such as Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, Picture Completion and Block Design is because these tests measure visual-spatial abilities in which males typically perform better than females.\n\nAside from traditional IQ tests like Raven's and WAIS, researchers have also used other tests that tap more into the Cattell-Horn-Caroll theory of intelligence in relation to gender. For example, a 2008 study by researcher Timothy Z. Keith on 25 subtests of Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, along with a sample of 6,818 adults and children from 6 to 59, found females scoring higher on the latent processing speed (Gs) factor, a small male advantage on the latent comprehension‚Äìknowledge (Gc) factor, higher male score on the latent visual‚Äìspatial reasoning (Gv) and higher male latent quantitative reasoning (RQ) factor. The study found no difference in latent long-term retrieval (Glr), short-term memory (Gsm), auditory processing (Ga) and fluid intelligence (Gf) factors. However the sex difference in general intelligence (g-factor) was inconsistent in children with small higher female \"g\" factor during adolescence, and consistent higher female latent \"g\" factor during adulthood. The finding of the study confirmed Lynn's theory that males develop slower, but did not replicate results that males after 16 years old should have higher \"g\" factor. Lead researcher Timothy Keith suggests past researchers like Lynn's had used emergent scores to calculate \"g\" factor which is not accurate since most intelligent theories define g factor as a latent variable and not an emergent one. Researcher Timothy Z Keith replicated the same results again in the same year when he conducted a study of 3,025 6‚Äì18 year old participants with higher female latent \"g\" factor at all ages.\n\nA 2015 study published in the journal of \"Psychology in Schools\" found no sex differences on standardized testing of achievement except a small persistent female advantage in reading and large female advantage in writing among a nationally representative sample of 1,574 6‚Äì21 year old participants.\n\n In 2006, researchers Stephen Camarata and Richard Woodcock also replicated exactly the same results in sample of 4,253 children and adults but found no sex differences in \"g\" factor. In 2011, researcher Timothy Z. Keith also found no significant sex differences in latent \"g\" factor among participants of 5- to 17-year-olds on a different IQ test known as the Differential Ability Scales.\n\nIn 2000, researchers Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad conducted a large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests taken from the Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but that there was no difference on the general intelligence factor (\"g\") and therefore explained the differences as due to non-\"g\" factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive reasoning part of the Primary Mental Abilities test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that \"g\" factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not \"g\" factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.\n\nIn 2007, Johnson and Bouchard (2007) conducted 40‚Äì60 mental tests that were not constructed to eliminate sex differences also found no sex differences in general intelligence or \"g\" factor except in residual factors such as verbal abilities and mental rotation. \nAnother study published in the \"Journal of Psychoeductional Assessment\" also found no sex differences in \"g\" factor in a sample size of 744 5‚Äì85 year old participants on the Wide Range Intelligence Test. Gerhard Meisenberg, based on data from 5975 males and 5939 females who took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, found that men generally score higher than women. However, this advantage has no consistent relationship to the g-loading of the sub-tests. So, it cannot be due to differences in general intelligence.\n\nA 2009 study published in the \"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology\" also found no sex differences in fluid intelligence except female 8 point advantage on writing and male 4 point advantage in math among 22‚Äì90 year old participants in a sample of 500 participants.\n\nThe current literature on sex differences produced inconsistent results depending on the type of testing used. Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many state that there are no sex differences in g (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel & Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006). The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in \"intelligence in general\" (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in \"general intelligence\" (\"g\" factor). The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while \"g\" factor is a latent scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between \"g\" and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and \"g\" are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to \"g\" factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlate highest with \"g\" factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence. The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory study have also been replicated in numerous other studies since.\n\nA 2012 review by researchers Richard E. Nisbett, Joshua Aronson, Clancy Blair, William Dickens, James Flynn, Diane F. Halpern and Eric Turkheimer discussed Arthur Jensen's 1998 studies on sex differences in intelligence. Jensen's tests were significantly g loaded but were not set-up to get rid of any sex differences (\"read differential item functioning\"). They summarized his conclusions as he quoted, \"No evidence was found for sex differences in the mean level of g or in the variability of g. Males, on average, excel on some factors; females on others.\" Jensen‚Äôs results that no overall sex differences existed for \"g\" has been reinforced by researchers who analyzed this issue with a battery of 42 mental ability tests and found no overall sex difference.\n\nAlthough most of the tests showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, they found female subjects performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities. For verbal fluency, females have been specifically found to perform slightly better in vocabulary and reading comprehension but significantly higher in speech production and essay writing. Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation. Researchers had then recommended that general models such as fluid and crystallized intelligence be divided into verbal, perceptual and visuospatial domains of g, because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks, thus evening out the sex differences on IQ tests.\n\nSome studies have identified the degree of IQ variance as a difference between males and females. Males tend to show greater variability on many traits, for example having both highest and lowest scores on tests of cognitive abilities, though this may differ between countries.\n\n\"Feingold (1992b) and Hedges and Nowell (1995) have reported that, despite average sex differences being small and relatively stable over time, test score variances of males were generally larger than those of females.\" Feingold \"found that males were more variable than females on tests of quantitative reasoning, spatial visualisation, spelling, and general knowledge. ... Hedges and Nowell go one step further and demonstrate that, with the exception of performance on tests of reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, more males than females were observed among high-scoring individuals.\"\n\nPsychologist and psychometrician Steve Blinkhorn published a criticism in the journal \"Nature\" against Richard Lynn and Paul Irwing on their meta-analysis of sex differences, where he said they were flawed in excluding an intelligence study from Mexico that accounted for almost 45% of the data. He said that had it not been excluded, no sex differences would have been found. He said there was a need for better research designs instead of summing up through meta-analysis.\n\nA 2008 study by Earl Hunt published in the journal \"Intelligence\" found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students. A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published \"Intelligence\" also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction. Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample. Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as Raven's Progressive matrices is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or \"g\" factor and only shares 50% of its variance. Tests like WAIS have also been criticized as not directly measuring \"g\" factor in a 2002 study published in \"Intelligence\". Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that \"g\" factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as Raven's or WAIS. Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of \"g\" factor. Therefore, he concluded that sex difference research should not be based on a single test but instead on multiple tests loaded with fluid intelligence.\n\nDifferences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Haier et al. found in a 2004 study that \"[m]en and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance. For men, the gray matter volume in the frontal and parietal lobes correlates with IQ; for women, the gray matter volume in the frontal lobe and Broca's area (which is used in language processing) correlates with IQ.\n\nAlthough men have bigger brain size which is partly explained by their bigger bodies, women have greater cortical thickness, cortical complexity and cortical surface area (controlling for body size) which compensates for smaller brain size. Meta-analysis and studies have found that brain size explains 6‚Äì12% of variance among individual intelligence and cortical thickness explains 5%.\n\nThe study of brain networks of men and women shows that in numerous graph-theoretical parameters, the structural connectome of women are significantly better connected than the connectome of men. Regarding the charge that there is bias in the research, it is argued that women's advantage remains valid if large-brain women and small-brain men are compared, and that this indicates that the graph-theoretical differences are due to sex and not to size differences.\n\nA performance difference in mathematics on the SAT exists in favor of males, though differences in mathematics course performance measures favor females. In 1983, Benbow concluded that the study showed a large sex difference by age 13 and that it was especially pronounced at the high end of the distribution. However, Gallagher and Kaufman criticized Benbow's and others' reports, which found that males were over-represented in the highest percentages, on the grounds that they had not ensured representative sampling.\n\nIn a 2008 study paid for by the National Science Foundation in the United States, researchers found that \"girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests. Although 20 years ago, high school boys performed better than girls in math, the researchers found that is no longer the case. The reason, they said, is simple: Girls used to take fewer advanced math courses than boys, but now they are taking just as many.\" However, the study indicated that, while boys and girls performed similarly on average, boys were over-represented among the very best performers as well as among the very worst. A 2011 meta-analysis with 242 studies from 1990 to 2007 involving 1,286,350 people found no overall sex difference of performance in mathematics. The meta-analysis also found that although there were no overall differences, a small sex difference that favored males in complex problem solving is still present in high school.\n\nKiefer and Sekaquaptewa proposed that a source of some women's underperformance and lowered perseverance in mathematical fields is these women's underlying \"implicit\" sex-based stereotypes regarding mathematical ability and association, as well as their identification with their gender. Some psychologists believe that many historical and current sex differences in mathematics performance may be related to boys' higher likelihood of receiving math encouragement than girls. Parents were, and sometimes still are, more likely to consider a son's mathematical achievement as being a natural skill while a daughter's mathematical achievement is more likely to be seen as something she studied hard for. This difference in attitude may contribute to girls and women being discouraged from further involvement in mathematics-related subjects and careers.\n\nStereotype threat has been shown to affect performance and confidence in mathematics of both males and females. In another experiment conducted on 80 Cornell University undergraduates, participants were taught how to perform a new task in gender salient (male advantage) versus gender-neutral conditions. Participants in the gender salient condition were told, ‚Äúmales on average perform better on such tests.‚Äù Even though participants were given identical scores at the end of the task, women in the gender salient condition rated their ability on the task significantly lower than those in the gender-neutral condition, and even reported reduced interest in related occupations. While these two studies highlight the effect of stereotype threat on self-perception, another experiment by Rydell and colleagues found that stereotype threat can actually impair women‚Äôs ability to learn new gender-typed material. Women in the stereotype threat condition had difficulty encoding math-related information into memory and, therefore, learned fewer mathematical rules and showed poorer math performance than did controls. Stereotype threat reduced women‚Äôs, but not men‚Äôs, ability to learn abstract mathematical rules and to transfer these rules to a second, isomorphic task. The researchers concluded that negative stereotypes about women in math reduce their level of math learning, which then leads to poorer performance in negatively stereotyped domains.\n\nTwo cross-country comparisons have found great variation in the gender differences regarding the degree of variance in mathematical ability. In most nations males have greater variance. In a few females have greater variance. Hyde and Mertz argue that boys and girls differ in the variance of their ability due to sociocultural factors.\n\nMetastudies show a male advantage in mental rotation and assessing horizontality and verticality and a female advantage in spatial memory. A proposed hypothesis is that men and women evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society. This explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities as a result of certain behaviors, such as navigating during a hunt. Similarly, this hypothesis suggests that women may have evolved to devote more mental resources to remembering locations of food sources in relation to objects and other features in order to gather food.\n\nA number of studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual information than men in a number of spatial tasks related to perceived orientation. However, 'visual dependence' has been found to be task specific and not a general characteristic of spatial processing that differs between the sexes. Here an alternative hypothesis suggests that heightened visual dependence in females does not generalize to all aspects of spatial processing but is probably attributable to task-specific differences in how male and females brains process multisensory spatial information.\n\nResults from studies conducted in the physical environment are not conclusive about sex differences, with various studies on the same task showing no differences. For example, there are studies that show no difference in finding one's way between two places. One study found men more likely to report having a good sense of direction and are more confident about finding their way in a new environment, but evidence does not support men having better map reading skills. Women have been found to use landmarks more often when giving directions and when describing routes. Additionally, a study concludes that women are better at recalling where objects are located in a physical environment. Women show greater proficiency and reliance on distinctive landmarks for navigation while males rely on an overall mental map.\n\nPerformance in mental rotation and similar spatial tasks is affected by gender expectations. For example, studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better, or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women, will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite. Experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's mental rotation ability. A study from the University of Toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after playing video games requiring complex mental rotation. The experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males. However, male participants still performed superior to female participants both before and after training.\n\nThe possibility of testosterone and other androgens as a cause of sex differences in psychology has been a subject of study. Adult women who were exposed to unusually high levels of androgens in the womb due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia score significantly higher on tests of spatial ability. Many studies find positive correlations between testosterone levels in healthy males and measures of spatial ability. However, the relationship is complex.\n\nA study was done to compare the relationship between mental rotation ability and gender difference, specifically in the SAT math section. Cognitive gender differences are apparent and findings of a male advantage in certain mathematical domains have been demonstrated cross-culturally. These gender differences found are largely in geometry and word problems and tend to be in countries with the highest-achieving students and with the largest gender gap in experience. Smaller differences were noted in countries with lower achieving students in mathematics which includes the United States. Moore and Smith say that within the United States, poorly educated female students outperform their male peers, but as the level of education increases, the male advantage in mathematics emerges.\n\nSpatial ability may be responsible in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10‚Äì20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation. Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.\n\nThe study found that when mental rotation is used as a predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from ‚àí0.03 to 0.54. However, a finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. For the verbal aptitude test on the SAT, there was a significant difference in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.\n\nThe ability to apply analytical analysis (as opposed to making intuitive decisions, i.e. System 1 and System 2 thinking) is related to, but different from IQ. On the cognitive reflection test, which consists of \"trick questions\" where the intuitive answer is wrong, women scored on average 1.03, while men scored 1.47. Bosch-Dom√®necha and colleagues (2014) further found not only did men outscore women on the CRT, but that greater exposure to prenatal androgens (via a lower 2D:4D ratio) is significantly correlated with a higher score on the cognitive reflection test regardless of sex. Several other studies have replicated these results and have found that men typically score higher than women on the CRT.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis of sex differences in scholastic achievement published in the journal of \"Psychological Bulletin\" found females outperformed males in teacher-assigned school marks throughout elementary, junior/middle, high school and at both undergraduate and graduate university level. The meta-analysis, done by researchers Daniel Voyer and Susan D. Voyer from the University of New Brunswick, drew from 97 years of 502 effect sizes and 369 samples stemming from the year 1914 to 2011. Another 2015 study by researchers Gijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary in \"Intelligence\" found that girl's overall education achievement is better in 70 percent of all the 47‚Äì75 countries that participated in PISA. The study consisting of 1.5 million 15-year-olds found higher overall female achievement across reading, mathematics, and science literacy and better performance across 70% of participating countries including many with negative gaps in socioeconomic and gender equality, and they fell behind in only 4% of countries. Stoet and Geary concluded that sex differences in educational achievement are not reliably linked to gender equality.\n\nBeyond sex differences in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women‚Äôs underrepresentation in higher education, especially in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the National Science Foundation shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the \"field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis\", which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According to the researchers, ‚Äúemphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women‚Äôs own minds, making them vulnerable to stereotype threat‚Äù.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that gender stereotyping plays a big role in influencing women‚Äôs academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.\n\nClaims from scientific research on sex differences in intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very sex differences they seek to explain. Psychologist Barry Schwartz extended the concept of \"idea technology\" to convey the point that the ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can affect our lives. This notion is also described as \"looping effects\" or \"feedback effects in cognition and culture\", whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.\n\nScientific claims about hardwired sex differences interact with people‚Äôs minds as they are communicated to the public in popular books and articles. ‚ÄòBrain facts‚Äô have become increasingly popular and persuasive on public attitudes due to the increased fascination with neuroscience. Suggestions made in public domains that sex differences in achievement in science, mathematics or philosophy can be explained by innate brain differences can have important psychological effects. Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of sex differences in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating essentialist beliefs about gender that deepen social divides.\n\nResearch suggests that claims about psychological sex differences having biological causes underlie the negative effects of stereotype threat. Two studies in maths performance found that stereotype threat effects were only seen when it was explicitly claimed that the gender gap in performance was a result of genetic factors. Furthermore, believing that males are hardwired to be better at math or any particular field reinforces the idea both that such abilities are \"gifted\" rather than earned, and that females need to work much harder because they do not possess this innate ability. An intervention study by Columbia and NYU psychologists challenged the ‚Äòfixed‚Äô view of intelligence and eliminated the gender gap in maths performance. Specifically, seventh grade students in the experimental conditions were encouraged either to view intelligence as malleable or to attribute academic difficulties to the novelty of middle school. Results showed that females in experimental conditions achieved significantly higher math standardized test scores than those in the control group.\n\nBeyond academia, the endorsement of biological explanations of sex differences in intelligence has been associated with greater modern day sexism. In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are hardwired to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, male participants became more supportive of sex discrimination at work after reading the scientific facts. Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.\n\nAs with any scientific work, claims about sex differences in the brain and their relation to behavior are subject to debate. Future research could be usefully targeted at exploring further the effects of believing in hardwired sex differences on society and how to reverse the negative consequences. Current research shows that believing in such claims increases gender bias in evaluations of others and backlash effects against females who violate gender norms. Such claims could result in parents and teachers perceiving and treating children more stereotypically, given the rising influence of gender specific \"brain-based\" educational strategies recommended to schools.\n\nDyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person‚Äôs fluency or comprehension accuracy in being able to read. The cause of this disability is associated with abnormal brain anatomy and function. Gray matter deficits have been demonstrated in dyslexics using structural magnetic resonance imaging. This deficit has been found in specific regions within the left hemisphere involved in language.\n\nThere is higher prevalence of dyslexia in males than in females. However, different abnormalities are found in female brains as opposed to male brains. In a study that examined gray matter volume in dyslexic females, it was found that there was less gray matter volume in the right precuneus and paracentral lobule/medial frontal gyrus. In males, there was less gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex. This study shows that dyslexia in females does not involve the left hemisphere regions involved in language as it does in males. Instead, it affects the sensory and motor cortices such as the motor and premotor cortex and primary visual cortex.\n\n"}

In Hindu philosophy, \"Sv√©na\" refers to the realization of one‚Äôs own true nature which is different from the notion of the body being the own Self.\n\nShankara in his commentary on the Chandogya Upanishad reminds us that only those who have renounced all desire for the external world and who have nothing else to fall back upon are able to comprehend the Supreme reality of the unity of the Self.

The person who has realized his own real nature becomes the fearless eternal seer of unity; for him intentions, works, sorrow and delusion cease to hold any meaning for these belong to the \" AnƒÅtman \", the body and the phenomenal world.

Topic maps were originally developed in the late 1990s as a way to represent back-of-the-book index structures so that multiple indexes from different sources could be merged. However, the developers quickly realized that with a little additional generalization, they could create a meta-model with potentially far wider application. The ISO standard is formally known as ISO/IEC 13250:2003.\n\nA topic map represents information using\n\nTopic maps are similar to concept maps and mind maps in many respects, though only topic maps are ISO standards. Topic maps are a form of semantic web technology similar to RDF.\n\nTopics, associations, and occurrences can all be typed, where the types must be defined by the one or more creators of the topic map(s). The definitions of allowed types is known as the ontology of the topic map.\n\nTopic maps explicitly support the concept of merging of identity between multiple topics or topic maps. Furthermore, because ontologies are topic maps themselves, they can also be merged thus allowing for the automated integration of information from diverse sources into a coherent new topic map. Features such as subject identifiers (URIs given to topics) and PSIs (\"published subject indicators\") are used to control merging between differing taxonomies. Scoping on names provides a way to organise the various names given to a particular topic by different sources.\n\nThe work standardizing topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) took place under the umbrella of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3 committee (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34, Working Group 3 ‚Äì Document description and processing languages ‚Äì Information Association). However, WG3 was disbanded and maintenance of ISO/IEC 13250 was assigned to WG8.\n\nThe topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) reference model and data model standards are defined independent of any specific serialization or syntax.\n\nThere are different ways of notating topic maps graphically, in addition to GTM, listed below. One recently developed example is Topic Maps Martian Notation. TMMN (its acronym) is a simple graphical notation used to explain the Topic Maps data model, and map out both ontologies and representative instance data. It is designed for use on whiteboard or paper, as well as within any diagram-based software including everyday presentation tools such as PowerPoint and OpenOffice.org. TMMN uses only a very small number of symbols ‚Äì \"blob\", \"label\", \"line\", \"dotted line\", and \"arrow\" ‚Äì to represent the relationships and basic elements of the topic maps model: topics, names, associations (and roles), scope, and occurrences (including subject identifiers and subject locators). The \"Martian\" refers to the archetypal \"Martian Scientist\", namely, the ability to communicate knowledge across linguistic and cultural barriers, known and unknown. It was developed as part of the musicDNA project.\nAdvanced Topic Maps Martian Notation is currently under development by the musicDNA community and includes shorthand notation for various types of whole-part relationships.\nThe specification is summarized in the abstract as follows: \"This specification provides a model and grammar for representing the structure of information resources used to define topics, and the associations (relationships) between topics. Names, resources, and relationships are said to be characteristics of abstract subjects, which are called topics. Topics have their characteristics within scopes: i.e. the limited contexts within which the names and resources are regarded as their name, resource, and relationship characteristics. One or more interrelated documents employing this grammar is called a topic map.\"\n\n\"Note that XTM 1.0 predates and therefore is not compatible with the more recent versions of the (ISO/IEC 13250) standard.\"\n\nOther proposed or standardized serialization formats include:\n\nThe above standards are all recently proposed or defined as part of ISO/IEC 13250. As described below, there are also other, serialization formats such as LTM, AsTMa= that have not been put forward as standards.\n\nLinear topic map notation (LTM) serves as a kind of shorthand for writing topic maps in plain text editors. This is useful for writing short personal topic maps or exchanging partial topic maps by email. The format can be converted to XTM.\n\nThere is another format called AsTMa which serves a similar purpose. When writing topic maps manually it is much more compact, but of course can be converted to XTM. Alternatively, it can be used directly with the Perl Module TM (which also supports LTM).\n\nThe data formats of XTM and LTM are similar to the W3C standards for RDF/XML or the older N3 notation.\n\nA de facto API standard called Common Topic Maps Application Programming Interface (TMAPI) was published in April 2004 and is supported by many Topic Maps implementations or vendors:\n\nIn normal use it is often desirable to have a way to arbitrarily query the data within a particular Topic Maps store. Many implementations provide a syntax by which this can be achieved (somewhat like 'SQL for Topic Maps') but the syntax tends to vary a lot between different implementations. With this in mind, work has gone into defining a standardized syntax for querying topic maps:\n\nIt can also be desirable to define a set of constraints that can be used to guarantee or check the semantic validity of topic maps data for a particular domain. (Somewhat like database constraints for topic maps). Constraints can be used to define things like 'every document needs an author' or 'all managers must be human'. There are often implementation specific ways of achieving these goals, but work has gone into defining a standardized constraint language as follows:\n\nTMCL is functionally similar to RDF Schema with Web Ontology Language (OWL).\n\nThe \"Topic Maps\" concept has existed for a long time. The HyTime standard was proposed as far back as 1992 (or earlier?). Earlier versions of ISO 13250 (than the current revision) also exist. More information about such standards can be found at the ISO Topic Maps site.\n\nSome work has been undertaken to provide interoperability between the W3C's RDF/OWL/SPARQL family of semantic web standards and the ISO's family of \"Topic Maps\" standards though the two have slightly different goals.\n\nThe semantic expressive power of Topic Maps is, in many ways, equivalent to that of RDF, but the major differences are that Topic Maps (i) provide a higher level of semantic abstraction (providing a template of topics, associations and occurrences, while RDF only provides a template of two arguments linked by one relationship) and (hence) (ii) allow \"n\"-ary relationships (hypergraphs) between any number of nodes, while RDF is limited to triplets.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8851941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8851941", "title": "Virtus", "text": "Virtus\n\nVirtus was a specific virtue in Ancient Rome. It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from Latin \"vir\", \"man\"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of Roman emperors, and was personified as a deity‚ÄîVirtus.\n\nThe origins of the word \"virtus\" can be traced back to the Latin word \"vir\", \"man\". The common list of attributes associated with \"virtus\" are typically perceived masculine strengths, which may indicate its derivation from \"vir\". From the early to the later days of the Roman Empire, there appears to have been a development in how the concept was understood. \n\nOriginally \"virtus\" was used to describe specifically martial courage, but it eventually grew to be used to describe a range of Roman virtues. It was often divided into different qualities including \"prudentia\" (prudence), \"iustitia\" (justice), \"temperantia\" (temperance, self-control), and \"fortitudo\" (courage). This division of virtue as a whole into cardinal virtues is today classified as virtue ethics, as described by Plato's \"Republic\" and Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\". It implies a link between \"virtus\" and the Greek concept of \"arete\".\n\nThis inclusion leads to the belief that at one time \"virtus\" extended to cover a wide range of meanings that covered one general ethical ideal. The use of the word began to grow and shift to fit the new idea of what manliness meant.\nNo longer did \"virtus\" mean that a person was a brave warrior but it could also mean that he was a good man, someone who did the right thing. During the time of the decline of the Roman elite \"virtus\" the Roman upper class no longer thought of themselves as unmanly if they did not serve in the military.\n\nVirtue as described by Aristotle was rediscovered in the medieval age by Muslim philosopher Averroes, which in turn influenced Thomas Aquinas to fuse virtue and ethics with Christianity in connection with the Renaissance of the 12th century.\n\n\"Virtus\" comes from the aristocratic tradition in which it is a specific type of public conduct. It is really only applicable in the \"cursus honorum\", certainly by the late republic at least. It is not a \"private\" virtue in the way that modern people might consider it. Valor, courage, and manliness are not things that can be pursued in the private sphere of the individual or the individual's private concerns. There could be no virtue in exploiting one's manliness in the pursuit of personal wealth, for example. \"Virtus\" is exercised in the pursuit of \"gloria\" for the benefit of the \"res publica\" resulting in the winning of eternal \"memoria\". According to D.C. Earl \"Outside the service of the \"res publica\" there can be no \"magistratus\" and therefore, strictly speaking, no \"gloria\", no \"nobilitas\", no \"virtus\"\".\n\nFor the nobility \"virtus\" lies not only in one's personal \"acta\" but also that of one's ancestors. However Cicero, a \"novus homo\", asserted that \"virtus\" was a virtue particularly suited to the new man just as nobilitas was suited to the noble. Cicero argued that just as young men from noble families won the favor of the people so too should the novus homo earn the favor of the people with his \"virtus\". He even extended the argument that \"virtus\" and not one‚Äôs family history should decide a man‚Äôs worthiness. \"Virtus\" is something that a man earns himself, not something that is given to him by his family, thus it is a better measure of a man‚Äôs ability. Cicero's goal was not to impugn the noble class but widen it to include men who had earned their positions by merit.\n\nThe term was used quite significantly by the historian Sallust, a contemporary of Cicero. Sallust asserted that it did not rightfully belong to the \"nobilitas\" as a result of their family background but specifically to the \"novus homo\" through the exercise of \"ingenium\" (talent). For Sallust and Cicero alike, \"virtus\" is situated in the winning of glory by the execution of illustrious deeds (\"egregia facinora\") and the observance of right conduct through \"bonae artes\".\n\n\"Virtus\" was not universally applicable to just anyone ‚Äì generally (although not always exclusively) only adult male Roman citizens would be thought of as possessing \"virtus\".\n\n\"Virtus\" was rarely attributed to women, likely because of its association with \"vir\". The highest regarded female virtue was \"pudicitia\": \"modesty\" or \"chastity\". Cicero, however, attributes this characteristic to females several times. He uses it once to describe Caecilia Metella when she helps a man who is being chased by assassins. Twice more he uses it when describing his daughter, Tullia, portraying her in his letters as brave in his absence. He uses it again to describe his first wife Terentia during his exile.\nLivy in Book 2 attributes it to Cloelia.\n\n\"Virtus\" was not a term commonly used to describe children. Since \"virtus\" was primarily attributed to a full grown man who had served in the military, children were not particularly suited to obtain this particular virtue.\n\nWhile a slave was able to be \"homo\" (\"man\") he was not considered a \"vir\". Slaves were often referred to as \"puer\" (Latin for \"boy\") to denote that they were not citizens. Since a slave could not be a \"vir\" it follows that they would not be allowed to have the quality of \"virtus\". Once a slave was manumitted he was able to become a \"vir\" and he was also classified as a freedman but this did not allow him to have \"virtus\". A good slave or freedman was said to have \"fides\", but no \"virtus\".\n\nForeigners in the Roman world could be attributed with \"virtus\": If they fought bravely they could be said to have \"virtus\". \"Virtus\" could also be lost in battle. \"Virtus\" could even be a cause to gain citizenship as in the case of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC for their \"virtus\" in battle.\n\n\"Virtus\" applies exclusively to a man's behaviour in the public sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the \"res publica\" in the \"cursus honorum\". His private business was no place to earn \"virtus\", even when it involved courage or feats of arms or other qualities associated to it if performed for the public good.\n\nWhile in many cultures around the world it is considered \"manly\" to father and provide for a family, family life was considered in the Roman world to be part of the private sphere. During this time there was no place for \"virtus\" in the private sphere. Most uses of \"virtus\" to describe any part of private life are ambiguous and often refer to another similar quality. In the Roman world the oldest living patriarch of the family was called the \"pater familias\" and this title implied that he was able to make all legal and binding decisions for the family; he also owned all the money, land, and other property. His wife, daughters, sons, and his sons‚Äô families were all under his \"potestas\". The only time a son was seen as separate from his father's control in the eyes of other Romans was when he assumed his public identity as a citizen. He could earn his \"virtus\" by serving in the military, and thus could only demonstrate manliness outside of the family setting. This is another reason that \"virtus\" is not often used to describe the Roman private life.\n\n\"Virtus\" was a crucial component for a political career. Its broad definition led to it being used to describe a number of qualities that the Roman people idealized in their leaders.\n\nIn everyday life a typical Roman, especially a young boy, would have been inculcated with the idea of \"virtus\". Since military service was a part of most Roman men's life, military training would have started fairly early. Young boys would have learned how to wield weapons and military tactics starting at home with their fathers and older male relatives and later in school. Also as a young boy one would have heard numerous stories about past heroes, battles, and wars. Some of these stories would have surely told of the \"virtus\" of past heroes, and even family members. Publicly it was easy to see the rewards of \"virtus\". Public triumphs were held for victorious generals and rewards were given to brave fighters. All of this propaganda would have encouraged young boys coming into their manhood to be brave fighters and earn the attribute of \"virtus\". It was the duty of every generation of men to maintain the \"dignitas\" which his family had already earned and enlarge it. This pressure to live up to the standards of one‚Äôs ancestors was great. In achieving \"virtus\" one could achieve \"gloria\". By gaining \"virtus\" and \"gloria\" one could hope to aspire to high political office and great renown.\n\nWhile young boys were encouraged to earn \"virtus\" there were also limits put on showing \"virtus\" in public. \"Virtus\" was often associated with being aggressive and this could be very dangerous in the public sphere and the political world. Displays of violent \"virtus\" were controlled through several methods. Men seeking to hold political office typically had to follow the \"cursus honorum\". Many political offices had an age minimum which ensured that the men filling the positions had the proper amount of experience in the military and in government. This meant that even if a man proved himself capable of filling a position or was able to persuade people that he was capable, he would not necessarily be able to hold the position until he had reached a certain age. This also served to ensure that in elections of public offices no one had a certain advantage over another person because by the time most men went into public office they would have retired from military service. Furthermore, before any Roman soldier could partake in single combat he had to gain permission from his general. This procedure was meant to keep soldiers from putting themselves in extremely dangerous situations that they may or may not have been able to handle in order gain \"virtus\".\n\nThe concept of \"virtus\" also tended to be a concept of morality as far as politics were concerned. This could range from the very literal definition of manliness seen in aggression and the ruthless acquisition of money, land, and power, or the lighter, more idealistic political meaning which almost took on the extended meaning of \"pietas\", a man who was morally upright and concerned with the matters of the state. Plautus in \"Amphitruo\" contrasted \"virtus\" and \"ambitio\". Virtus is seen as a positive attribute, though \"ambitio\" itself is not necessarily a negative attribute but is often associated with negative methods such as bribery. Plautus said that just as great generals and armies win victory by \"virtus\", so should political candidates. \"Ambitio\" ‚Äúis the wrong method of reaching a good end.‚Äù Part of \"virtus\", in the political sphere was to deal justly in every aspect of one‚Äôs life, especially in political and state matters.\n\nAlthough the two concepts are related, \"virtus\", for the Roman, did not necessarily emphasize the behavior that the associations of the present-day English term 'virtue' suggest. \"Virtus\" was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds' (\"egregia facinora\"), and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought \"gloria\" ('a reputation'). This \"gloria\" was attached to two ideas: \"fama\" ('what people think of you') and \"dignitas\" ('one's standing in the community'). The struggle for \"virtus\" in Rome was above all a struggle for public office (\"honos\"), since it was through aspiring to high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show his manliness by means of military achievement which would in turn cultivate a reputation and votes. It was the duty of every aristocrat and would-be aristocrat to maintain the \"dignitas\" which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree, through higher political office and military victories. This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.\n\nWhile in many cultures the virtue of manliness is also seen as being partly sexual, in the Roman world \"virtus\" apparently did not have sexual connotations. Similar words deriving from the same stem often have sexual connotations. In the Roman world \"virtus\" dealt with a great many areas such as martial courage, honor, and being morally upright rather than sexual manliness.\n\nOne of the most well known demonstrations of \"virtus\" was shown by Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. Before Cincinnatus was appointed dictator in 458 BC, Rome was in the midst of a battle with the Aequi and needed someone to take control. Messengers sent to fetch him found him plowing in his field. Upon being informed of the appointment, he wept saying, \"So my field will be unsown this year, and we shall be in danger of not having enough food to support us.\" Nevertheless, he dutifully gathered his things, kissed his wife goodbye and departed to raise an army and defeat the Aequi in a mere fifteen days. Upon returning home after the victory, Cincinnatus picked up the plough from where he left it and began plowing again. Dionysius of Halicarnassus recounts this story to illustrate the type of leaders the men of Rome were. He says that they ‚Äúworked with their hands, led self-disciplined lives, did not complain about honorable poverty, and far from pursuing positions of royal power.‚Äù\n\nPompey is another prominent example of \"virtus\". In 55 BC, Pompey inaugurated his grand theatre complex and dedicated several shrines to different gods, one of these being \"Virtus\". This consecrated Pompey‚Äôs link with \"virtus\". He gained a reputation with the public as being a man of \"virtus\". Cicero, throughout his speech, the \"De imperio Cn. Pompei\", connects Pompey with \"divina virtus\". Pompey was so closely connected with \"virtus\" that once during a production of a play at the \"Ludi Apollinares\" one of the characters spoofed Pompey by stating \"eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes\": \"The time will come when you bitterly resent that same \"virtus\"\". The audience did not need to hear his name to know that Pompey was being referenced.\n\nM. Claudius Marcellus, during the battle of Clastidium in 222 BC, dedicated a temple to Honos and Virtus. This was one of the first times that \"Virtus\" had been recognized as divine. The connection with \"Honos\" would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of \"virtus\" led to election to public office and both were considered \"honos\". The cult of \"Honos\" was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that \"Virtus\" would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.\n\nDuring the reign of Augustus, the Senate voted that a golden shield be inscribed with Augustus‚Äô attributes and displayed in the Curia Iulia, including \"virtus\", \"clementia\", \"iustitia\", and \"pietas\". These political catchwords continued to be used as propaganda by later emperors.\n\nThe comic poet Plautus made use of the concept of \"virtus\" in his play \"Trinummus\" which concerned family \"virtus\", honor and public office, and obligations to the state. He also offered commentary on the concept of \"virtus\" in \"Amphitruo\" (see above \"Virtus and the Public\").\n\n\n"}

It is typically written in formal, third-person language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.\n\nLike any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host‚Äîhistorically, for younger brides in Western culture, the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family‚Äîto issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social secretary to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service. With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a mail merge with word processing and spreadsheet software.\n\nPrior to the invention of the moveable-type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a Town crier: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of Calligraphy, to hand-craft their notices.\n\nSuch documents often carried the Coat of arms, or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.\n\nDespite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.\n\nIn 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or Mezzotint) by Ludwig von Siegen brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class. Engraving, as the name implies, requires an artisan to \"hand write\" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.\n\nAt the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.\n\nFollowing the invention of Lithography by Alois Senefelder in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving. This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.\n\nWedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‚Äòdouble envelope‚Äô was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.\n\nThe origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the life-styles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as Amy Vanderbilt and Emily Post, emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate etiquette.\n\nGrowth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of thermography. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.\n\nMore recently Letterpress printing has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and craft appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.\n\nLaser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years. Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic, or to mark certain types of metal invitations.\n\nThe latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organising and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.\n\nEtiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language. In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in formal, third-person language, saying that the hosts wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions.\n\nAs the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., \"Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith\" or \"Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith\". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:\n\nMr. and Mrs. John A Smith\nrequest the honour of your presence\nat the wedding of their daughter\nJessica Marie\nto\nMr. Michael Francis Miller\non the first of November \nat twelve noon \nChristchurch Hall\nRichmond, Virginia\nNote the seemingly anglicised spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by Emily Post in the 1920s.\n\nIn the United States, the line \"request...presence\" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; \"pleasure of your company\" is used when it is held elsewhere.\n\nIf the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well. If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice: \"The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of...\"\n\nFormal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.\n\nInformal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter. So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.\n\nCommercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: engraving, lithography, thermography, letterpress printing, sometimes blind embossing, compression plate process, or offset printing. More recently, many do-it-yourself brides are printing on their home computers using a laser printer or inkjet printer. For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in calligraphy.\n\nHistorically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical. When mass-production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing. Hand-written invitations, in the hosts' own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings, and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings.\n\nTissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text. Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative. Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.\n\nModern invitation design follows fashion trends. Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme. For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty typefaces and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations.\n\nThe invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters). Other options include a sheet of paper, a tri-fold, or a trendy pocket-fold design. The appropriate paper density depends on the design, but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock.\n\nTraditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner envelope may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing. More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.\n\nIn countries that issue them, the envelope may be franked with love stamps. The United States postal service issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).\n\nIn addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials. The ensemble may include an RSVP response card, a separate invitation to a wedding reception, and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWedding invitations should be sent out 6‚Äì8 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings. Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.\n\nThese printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.\n\nAs with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend. Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.\n\nA proper response is written on the recipient's normal stationery, following the form of the invitation. For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either \"Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November\", or \"Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November.\"\n\nPre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates.\n\nIn \"The Invitations\" episode of \"Seinfeld\", George Costanza's fianc√©e Susan is killed by licking toxic wedding invitations that George picked out because they were inexpensive.\n\n"}

The cult is believed to have its origin among Song dynasty Neo-Confucians, and reached a culmination and eventual end in the Qing era.\n\nDuring the Song dynasty, Confucianism became the dominant belief system, and neo-Confucians such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi placed strong emphasis on chastity, with Cheng Yi believed to be responsible for the rise of the cult of widow chastity. Cheng Yi thought it improper for a man to marry a widow because \"a marriage is a match and if one takes someone who has already lost her integrity, he would also lose his\". On the question of widows who had become impoverished due to the death of their husbands, Cheng stated: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\" While it was normal for widows to remarry in the early Song period, remarriage would become a social stigma in later eras due to the influence of Confucians, which led to hardship and loneliness for many widows. The Song poetess Li Qingzhao, after her first husband Zhao Mingcheng died, remarried briefly when she was aged 49, for which she was strongly criticised in her lifetime.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, chaste widows were elevated to the role of cultural heroes. Chaste widows were commemorated by the construction of chastity memorial arches (Ë≤ûÁØÄÂùä) and shrines, and honoured with commemorative writings. The state awarded 'testimonial of merit' (ÊóåË°®, \"jingbiao\") to chaste women, giving approval of local chastity cults whereby commemorative arches and shrines were erected to honour the women by members of their families or communities. Widow chastity became increasingly common, and chastity also became associated with suicide, with suicide by widows increasing dramatically during the Ming era.\n\nDuring the Qing period, the prevalence of child marriage along with a high rate of premature death among men left a substantial number of young women as widowers. Typically, a widowed woman would have been taken into her husband's familial household before his death and as a result would be unable to fulfill her intended purpose; birthing a male child to continue the husband's patriline. However, due to Qing-era China's higher proportion of men (mostly due to female infanticide) a fertile woman, despite her previous marriage, could be sold and wed to another family for a substantial price. \n\nThe Qing court disapproved of this practice and instead regarded widow chastity as the epitome of filial piety and also as a statement of loyalty to the imperial court and the government officials. To promote this viewpoint the Qing court arranged to confer honors upon a family housing a chaste widow along with other measures such as the construction of a large and ornate ceremonial arch‚Äî\"Chastity Paifang\" or \"Chastity and Filial Paifang\" (ÁØÄÂ≠ùÁâåÂùä) ‚Äîin the family's community. Widows were also encouraged to adhere to chastity by way of legal impetuses, as according to Qing era law a widow could only inherit or act as a custodian of her husbands property if she preserved her sexuality as a statement of \"loyalty\" to her late husband. In culturally dissident regions of the Chinese empire, government officials started \"Widow Chastity\" crusades to enforce orthodox Chinese culture and eliminate unconventional marriage customs, particularly the Levirate, a practice in which a man marries his dead brother's widow in order to continue his patriline. \n\nThe \"widow chastity\" agenda began to receive controversy from the Qing court when elite families in central regions of China started using the imperial commendation of widow chastity to gain an edge in the social competition within their communities. Authorities were particularly concerned with dubious cases in which honors had been given to families where the widow had committed suicide following her husband's death.Despite suicide being regarded as an honorable and virtuous course of action for a widow to take, the circumstances surrounding these suicides were often very suspicious and suggested foul play on the part of the husband's family. Eventually this issue led the imperial court to promote \"Widow Chastity\" with much less zeal and offer honors with more careful discretion.New cultural and intellectual developments in Qing China, in particular, the \"Evidential Research Movement\" (Kaozheng), also began to open up new conversations on the fundamental morality of \"Widow Chastity\". Skeptics of neo-Confucian status quo of the time, notably Wang Zhong, condemned \"Widow Chastity\" as a collection of outdated rituals lacking in logic and basic human compassion.\n\n\n"}

Williams, first published in December 2006. It explores how some companies in the early 21st century have used mass collaboration and open-source technology, such as wikis, to be successful.\n\nAccording to Tapscott, Wikinomics is based on four ideas: Openness, Peering, Sharing, and Acting Globally. The use of mass collaboration in a business environment, in recent history, can be seen as an extension of the trend in business to outsource: externalize formerly internal business functions to other business entities. The difference however is that instead of an organized business body brought into being specifically for a unique function, mass collaboration relies on free individual agents to come together and cooperate to improve a given operation or solve a problem. This kind of outsourcing is also referred to as crowdsourcing, to reflect this difference. This can be incentivized by a reward system, though it is not required.\n\nThe book also discusses seven new models of mass collaboration, including:\n\nThe last chapter is written by viewers, and was opened for editing on February 5, 2007.\n\nAccording to Tapscott and Williams, these four principles are the central concepts of wikinomics in the enterprise:\n\n\nIn the chapter \"The Perfect Storm\", the authors give an overview of the economic effects of the kind of transactions Web 2.0 permits. According to the authors, Coase's Law (see Ronald Coase) governs the expansion of a business:\nA firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market.\nHowever, because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies, the cost of transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law. That is:\nA firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm. Thus, the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping, firms who do not change their current structures will perish. Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets.\n\nA review of this book in the \"Harvard Business Review\" states \"like its title, the book's prose can fall into breathless hype.\" A review of this book in \"Choice\" recommends the book for \"general readers and practitioners,\" but cautions that the authors \"present an optimistic overview of successful collaborations and business ventures\", \"use unique terms (e.g., marketocracy, prosumption, knowledge commons)\", should have given \"more consideration [to] the darker sides of human motivation as well as groupthink and mass mediocrity\", and \"primarily draw on their own observations of businesses and trends for the ideas presented\".\n\nTapscott and Williams released a followup to Wikinomics, titled \"Macrowikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World\", on September 28, 2010.\n\n\n"}

It shows the components of the circuit as simplified shapes, and the power and signal connections between the devices. \n\nA wiring diagram usually gives information about the relative position and arrangement of devices and terminals on the devices, to help in building or servicing the device. This is unlike a schematic diagram, where the arrangement of the components' interconnections on the diagram usually does not correspond to the components' physical locations in the finished device. A pictorial diagram would show more detail of the physical appearance, whereas a wiring diagram uses a more symbolic notation to emphasize interconnections over physical appearance. \n\nA wiring diagram is often used to troubleshoot problems and to make sure that all the connections have been made and that everything is present. \n\nArchitectural wiring diagrams show the approximate locations and interconnections of receptacles, lighting, and permanent electrical services in a building. Interconnecting wire routes may be shown approximately, where particular receptacles or fixtures must be on a common circuit. \nWiring diagrams use standard symbols for wiring devices, usually different from those used on schematic diagrams. The electrical symbols not only show where something is to be installed, but also what type of device is being installed. For example, a surface ceiling light is shown by one symbol, a recessed ceiling light has a different symbol, and a surface fluorescent light has another symbol. Each type of switch has a different symbol and so do the various outlets. There are symbols that show the location of smoke detectors, the doorbell chime, and thermostat. On large projects symbols may be numbered to show, for example, the panel board and circuit to which the device connects, and also to identify which of several types of fixture are to be installed at that location. \n\nA set of wiring diagrams may be required by the electrical inspection authority to approve connection of the residence to the public electrical supply system. \n\nWiring diagrams will also include panel schedules for circuit breaker panelboards, and riser diagrams for special services such as fire alarm or closed circuit television or other special services.\n\n\n\n"}
