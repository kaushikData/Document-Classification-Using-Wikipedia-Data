For instance, if Person X is known for exposing secrets in an organization, the organization leaders announce that \"any members who have dirty talking habits will be dealt with\" to warn Person X. It refers to the ancient Greek fabulist Aesop.\n\nThe term \"Aesopian language\" was first used by the nineteenth-century Russian writer Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin to describe the writing technique he began using late in his career, which he compared to Aesop's Fables. His purpose was to satirize the social ills of the time but evade the harsh censorship of the late Russian Empire of which he was a particular target.\n\nThe Soviet-era writer Lev Loseff noted that the use of Aesopian language remained a favorite technique of writers (including himself) under Soviet censorship. Maliheh Tyrell defines the term in the Soviet context and observes that the use of Aesopian language extended to other national literatures under Soviet rule: \nAccording to one critic, \"Censorship... had a positive, formative impact upon the Aesopian writers' style by obliging them to sharpen their thoughts.\"\n\nThe German-American philosopher Herbert Marcuse uses the term in his book \"One-Dimensional Man\" somewhat interchangeably with Orwellian language. In that context, \"Aesopian Language\" refers to the idea that certain usages of language work to 'suppress certain concepts or keep them out of the general discourse within society'. An example of such a technique is the use of abbreviations to possibly prevent undesirable questions from arising: \"AFL-CIO entombs the radical political differences which once separated the two organizations.\"\n\nWithin the context of politics, a term with a very similar meaning is called dog-whistle politics, which describes the use of coded language to address voters' interests. Certain sections of the electorate will react strongly to controversial content if spoken of overtly but may not be so attuned that they notice statements that appear neutral to outsiders.\n\n\n"}

Cavanagh argues against the conventional understanding of equal opportunity, in particular both meritocracy and most substantial interpretations of equality, including the idea of ‘equal life chances’. Instead, he argues for a more limited approach of trying to eliminate specific kinds of discrimination (including race discrimination), together with trying to provide enough opportunities, and help to access them, such that most people have some degree of control over their lives.\n\nThe book caused some controversy when the author was appointed as an adviser to then Labour Minister David Blunkett when it was revealed that the book argued that it was sometimes rational (in an economic sense) for white employers to discriminate against black applicants which in some eyes amounted to effectively condoning racial discrimination.\n\nThis led to widespread calls for Cavanagh to be sacked, with questions tabled in Parliament, and the affair rumbled on for a few days. \"The Guardian\"'s letters page carried a balance of letters for and against Cavanagh.\n\nThe book received positive reviews in the \"Times Educational Supplement\" \"The Spectator\", and in academic journals including \"Ethics\", \"Notre Dame Philosophical Review\", \"Theory and Research in Education\" and \"Contemporary Political Theory\".\n\nOther reviews were more mixed, including the \"London Review of Books\", \"The Independent\", \"Philosophical Books\" and \"Political Studies Review\" and \"Utilitas\", the latter two arguing that the work does not adequately engage other scholarly literature relating to equality of opportunity by authors such as Joel Feinberg or George Sher.\n"}
{"id": "32329761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32329761", "title": "Analytica (software)", "text": "Analytica (software)\n\nAnalytica is a visual software package developed by Lumina Decision Systems for creating, analyzing and communicating quantitative decision models. As a modeling environment, it is interesting in the way it combines hierarchical influence diagrams for visual creation and view of models, intelligent arrays for working with multidimensional data, Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing risk and uncertainty, and optimization, including linear and nonlinear programming. Its design, especially its influence diagrams and treatment of uncertainty, is based on ideas from the field of decision analysis. As a computer language, it is notable in combining a declarative (non-procedural) structure for referential transparency, array abstraction, and automatic dependency maintenance for efficient sequencing of computation.\n\nAnalytica models are organized as influence diagrams. Variables (and other objects) appear as nodes of various shapes on a diagram, connected by arrows that provide a visual representation of dependencies. Analytica influence diagrams may be hierarchical, in which a single \"module\" node on a diagram represents an entire submodel.\n\nHierarchical influence diagrams in Analytica serve as a key organizational tool. Because the visual layout of an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction, people are able to take in far more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is possible with less visual paradigms, such as spreadsheets and mathematical expressions. Managing the structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.\n\nInfluence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication. Once a quantitative model has been created and its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed. The ability of a target audience to understand these aspects is critical to the modeling enterprise. The visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions or cell formulae. When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by the visual depiction of the model's structure.\n\nThe existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of investing in quantitative model building. When all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on \"cross-talk\", and therefore lead to more productive interactions within the organization. The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels.\n\nAnalytica uses index objects to track the dimensions of multidimensional arrays. An index object has a name and a list of elements. When two multidimensional values are combined, for example in an expression such as\n\nwhere \"Revenue\" and \"Expenses\" are each multidimensional, Analytica repeats the profit calculation over each dimension, but recognizes when same dimension occurs in both values and treats it as the same dimension during the calculation, in a process called \"intelligent array abstraction\". Unlike most programming languages, there is no inherent ordering to the dimensions in a multidimensional array. This avoids duplicated formulas and explicit FOR loops, both common sources of modeling errors. The simplified expressions made possible by intelligent array abstraction allow the model to be more accessible, interpretable, and transparent.\n\nAnother consequence of intelligent array abstraction is that new dimensions can be introduced or removed from an existing model, without requiring changes to the model structure or changes to variable definitions. For example, while creating a model, the model builder might assume a particular variable, for example \"discount_rate\", contains a single number. Later, after constructing a model, a user might replace the single number with a table of numbers, perhaps \"discount_rate\" broken down by \"Country\" and by \"Economic_scenario\". These new divisions may reflect the fact that the effective discount rate is not the same for international divisions of a company, and that different rates are applicable to different hypothetical scenarios. Analytica automatically propagates these new dimensions to any results that depend upon \"discount_rate\", so for example, the result for \"Net present value\" will become multidimensional and contain these new dimensions. In essence, Analytica repeats the same calculation using the discount rate for each possible combination of \"Country\" and \"Economic_scenario\".\n\nThis flexibility is important when exploring computation tradeoffs between the level of detail, computation time, available data, and overall size or dimensionality of parametric spaces. Such adjustments are common after models have been fully constructed as a way of exploring \"what-if\" scenarios and overall relationships between variables.\n\nIncorporating uncertainty into model outputs helps to provide more realistic and informative projections. Uncertain quantities in Analytica can be specified using a distribution function. When evaluated, distributions are sampled using either Latin hypercube or Monte Carlo sampling, and the samples are propagated through the computations to the results. The sampled result distribution and summary statistics can then be viewed directly (mean, fractile bands, probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF)), Analytica supports collaborative decision analysis and probability management through the use of the SIPMath(tm) standard.\n\nSystem dynamics is an approach to simulating the behaviour of complex systems over time. It deals with feedback loops and time delays on the behaviour of the entire system. The Dynamic() function in Analytica allows definition of variables with cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops. It expands the influence diagram notation, which does not normally allow cycles. At least one link in each cycle includes a time lag, depicted as a gray influence arrow to distinguish it from standard black arrows without time lags.\n\nAnalytica includes a general language of operators and functions for expressing mathematical relationships among variables. Users can define functions and libraries to extend the language.\n\nAnalytica has several features as a programming language designed to make it easy to use for quantitative modeling: It is a visual programming language, where users view programs (or \"models\") as influence diagrams, which they create and edit visually by adding and linking nodes. It is a declarative language, meaning that a model declares a definition for each variable without specifying an execution sequence as required by conventional imperative languages. Analytica determines a correct and efficient execution sequence using the dependency graph. It is a referentially transparent functional language, in that execution of functions and variables have no side effects i.e. changing other variables. Analytica is an array programming language, where operations and functions generalize to work on multidimensional arrays.\n\nAnalytica has been used for policy analysis, business modeling, and risk analysis. Areas in which Analytica has been applied include energy, health and pharmaceuticals, \nenvironmental risk and emissions policy analysis, wildlife management,\necology,\nclimate change, technology and defense,\nstrategic financial planning, \nR&D planning and portfolio management, \nfinancial services, \naerospace, manufacturing and environmental health impact assessment.\n\nThe Analytica software runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Three editions (Professional, Enterprise, Optimizer) each with more functions and cost, are purchased by users interested in building models. A free edition is available, called Analytica Free 101, which allows you to build medium to moderate sized models of up to 101 user objects.. Free 101 also allows you to view models with more than 101 objects, change inputs, and compute results, which enables free sharing of models for review. A more capable but non-free Power Player enables users to save inputs and utilize database connections. The Analytica Cloud Player allows you to share models over the web and lets users access and run via a web browser.\n\nThe most recent release of Analytica is version 5.1, released in May 2018.\n\nAnalytica's predecessor, called \"Demos\", grew from the research on tools for policy analysis by Max Henrion as a PhD student and later professor at Carnegie Mellon University between 1979 and 1990. Henrion founded Lumina Decision Systems in 1991 with Brian Arnold. Lumina continued to develop the software and apply it to environmental and public policy analysis applications. Lumina first released Analytica as a product in 1996.\n"}
{"id": "1398957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1398957", "title": "Atomism (social)", "text": "Atomism (social)\n\nAtomism or social atomism is a sociological theory arising from the scientific notion \"atomic theory\", coined by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus and the Roman philosopher Lucretius. In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or atoms. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the individual as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life. This theory refers to \"the tendency for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms\". Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society. The individual is the ‘atom’ of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis. \nPolitical theorists such as John Locke and Thomas Hobbes extend social atomism to the political realm. They assert that human beings are fundamentally self-interested, equal and rational \"social atoms\" that together form an aggregate society of self-interested individuals. Those participating in society must sacrifice a portion of their individual rights in order to form a \"social contract\" with the other persons in society. Ultimately, although some rights are renounced, self-interested cooperation occurs for the mutual preservation of the individuals and for society at large. \nThose who criticize the theory of social atomism believe that it neglects the idea of the individual as unique. Sociologist Elizabeth Wolgast asserts that,\n“From the atomistic standpoint, the individuals who make up a society are interchangeable like molecules in a bucket of water--society a mere aggregate of individuals. This introduces a harsh and brutal equality into our theory of human life and it contradicts our experience of human beings as unique and irreplaceable, valuable in virtue of their variety--in what they don't share--not in virtue of their common ability to reason.” \nThose who question social atomism argue that it is unjust to treat all persons equally when individual necessities and circumstances are clearly dissimilar.\n\n"}
{"id": "1844932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844932", "title": "Avoidance speech", "text": "Avoidance speech\n\nAvoidance speech is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many Australian Aboriginal languages and Austronesian languages as well as some North American languages, Highland East Cushitic languages and Bantu languages.\n\nAvoidance speech styles tend to have the same phonology and grammar as the standard language they are a part of. The lexicon, however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.\n\nAvoidance speech in Australian Aboriginal languages is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered taboo. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in Warlpiri or cross-cousins in Dyirbal. All relations are classificatory – more people may fall into the \"mother-in-law\" category than just a man's wife's mother.\n\nAvoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called mother-in-law languages, although they are not actually separate languages but separate lexical sets with the same grammar and phonology. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, \"jijan\", for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In Guugu Yimidhirr the avoidance speech verb \"bali-l\" \"travel\" covers several everyday verbs meaning \"go\", \"walk\", \"crawl\", \"paddle\", \"float, sail, drift\", and \"limp along\". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.\n\nIn some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the older member may talk to the younger in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the Umpila, in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.\n\nChildren in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age. Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a \"secret language\" or \"mystic language\", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.\n\nA special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking Highland East Cushitic languages in southwestern Ethiopia. In Kambaata and Sidamo, this system is called \"ballishsha\", and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law. Women who practice \"ballishsha\" do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father. Instead, they may use paraphrase, synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or borrowings from other languages.\n\n\"Hlonipha\", or \"isihlonipho\", is a traditional system of avoidance speech in Nguni Bantu languages of southern Africa including Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi. This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice \"hlonipha\" may not say the names of these men or any words with the same root as their names. They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The \"hlonipha\" system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a one-factor model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by a single source of randomness.\nIt belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models, i.e. it can fit today's zero-coupon bond prices, and in its most general form, today's prices for a set of caps, floors or European swaptions. The model was introduced by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski in 1991.\n\nThe main state variable of the model is the short rate, which is assumed to follow the stochastic differential equation (under the risk-neutral measure):\n\nwhere \"dW\" is a standard Brownian motion. The model implies a log-normal distribution for the short rate and therefore the expected value of the money-market account is infinite for any maturity.\n\nIn the original article by Fischer Black and Piotr Karasinski the model was implemented using a binomial tree with variable spacing, but a trinomial tree implementation is more common in practice, typically a lognormal application of the Hull-White Lattice.\n\nThe model is used mainly for the pricing of exotic interest rate derivatives such as American and Bermudan bond options and swaptions, once its parameters have been calibrated to the current term structure of interest rates and to the prices or implied volatilities of caps, floors or European swaptions. Numerical methods (usually trees) are used in the calibration stage as well as for pricing.\n\n\n"}

The centers that these Shluchim established were termed \"Chabad houses.\" Rabbi Schneerson was a pioneer in the field of Orthodox Judaism outreach (\"Kiruv\").\n\nChabad has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues, and various forms of more direct outreach efforts.

Many of these efforts are geared towards secular or less religious Jews. Additionally, unmarried rabbinical students spend weeks during the summer in locations that do not yet have a permanent Chabad presence, making housecalls, putting up mezuzot and teaching about Judaism. This is known as Merkos Shlichus.\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson also initiated a Jewish children's movement, called Tzivos Hashem (lit. \"Army [of] God\"), for under bar/bat mitzvah-age children, to inspire them to increase in study of Torah and observance of mitzvot.\n\nRabbi Schneerson also encouraged the use of modern technology in outreach efforts such as Mitzva tanks, which are mobile homes that travel a city or country.

{"id": "881572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881572", "title": "Chess notation", "text": "Chess notation\n\nChess notations are various systems that have developed to record either the moves made in a game of chess or the position of pieces on a chessboard. The earliest systems of notation used lengthy narratives to describe each move; these gradually evolved into terser notation systems. Currently algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard and is widely used. Algebraic notation has several variations. Descriptive chess notation was used in English- and Spanish-language literature until the late 20th century, but is now obsolete. There are some special systems for international correspondence chess. Portable Game Notation is used when working with computer chess programs. Systems also exist for transmission using Morse code over telegraph or radio.\n\nSome move-recording notations are designed mainly for use by human players; others are designed for use by computers.\n\nIn recognized competitions, all players are required to record all the moves of both players in order to resolve disputes about whether a player has made an illegal move and what the position should now be. In addition, if there is a time limit rule that requires each player to complete a specified number of moves in a specified time, as there is in most serious competition, an accurate count of the moves must be kept. All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one's games so that one can look for improvements in one's play. The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.\n\n\nThe following table lists examples of the same moves in some of the notations which may be used by humans. Each table cell contains White's move followed by Black's move, as they are listed in a single line of written notation.\n\nIn all forms of notation, the result is usually indicated at the conclusion of the game by either \"1–0\", indicating that White won, \"0–1\" indicating that Black won or \"½–½\", indicating a draw. Moves that result in checkmate can be marked with \"#\", \"++\", or \"‡\" or to indicate the end of game and the winner, instead of or in addition to \"1–0\" or \"0–1\".\n\nAnnotators commenting on a game frequently use question marks (\"?\") and exclamation marks (\"!\") to label a move as bad or praise the move as a good one (see Chess annotation symbols).\n\nThe following are commonly used for chess-related computer systems (in addition to Coordinate and Smith notation, which are described above):\n\nSome special methods of notation were used for transmitting moves by telegraph or radio, usually using Morse Code. The Uedemann code and Gringmuth notation worked by using a two-letter label for each square and transmitting four letters – two letters for the origin square followed by two letters for the destination square. Castling is shown as a king move. Squares are designated from White's side of the board, files from left to right and ranks from nearest to farthest. The Rutherford code first converted the move into a number and then converted the move number into a composite Latin word. It could also transmit moves of two games at the same time.\nThis code was devised by Louis Uedemann (1854–1912). The method was never actually used, mainly because a transposition of letters can result in a valid but incorrect move. Many sources incorrectly use this name for the Gringmuth code.\n\nThe files are labeled \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", \"O\", \"O\", \"I\", \"E\", and \"A\". The ranks are labeled \"B\", \"D\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"K\", \"L\", and \"P\". A square on the queenside is designated by its file letter and then its rank letter. A square on the kingside is designated by its rank letter then its file letter.\n\nThis method was invented by Dmitry Alexeyevich Gringmuth but it is sometimes incorrectly called the Uedemann Code. It was used as early as 1866. Files were designated with one of two letters, depending on whether it was on White's side or Black's side. These letters were: B and M, C and N, D and P, F and R, G and S, H and T, K and W, L and Z. Ranks were labeled: \"A\", \"E\", \"I\", \"O\", \"O\", \"I\", \"E\", and \"A\".\n\nThis code was invented in 1880 by Sir William Watson Rutherford (1853–1927). At the time, the British Post Office did not allow digits or ciphers in telegrams, but they did allow Latin words. This method also allowed moves for two games to be transmitted at the same time. In this method, the legal moves in the position were counted using a system until the move being made was reached. This was done for both games. The move number of the first game was multiplied by 60 and added to the move number of the second game. Leading zeros were added as necessary to give a four-digit number. The first two digits would be 00 through 39, which corresponded to a table of 40 Latin roots. The third digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin prefixes and the last digit corresponded to a list of 10 Latin suffixes. The resulting word was transmitted.\n\nAfter rules were changed so that ciphers were allowed in telegrams, this system was replaced by the Gringmuth Notation.\n\nPositions are usually shown as diagrams (images), using the symbols shown here for the pieces.\n\nThere is also a notation for recording positions in text format, called the Forsyth–Edwards notation (FEN). This is useful for adjourning a game to resume later or for conveying chess problem positions without a diagram. A position can also be recorded by listing the pieces and the squares they reside on, for example: White: Ke1, Rd3, etc.\n\nWritten chess notation recording is often necessary when participating in chess tournaments. In many tournaments players are required to record their games' notation on a score sheet.\n\nThere are also systems for classifying types of endgames. See Chess endgame#Endgame classification for more details.\n\nThe notation for chess moves evolved slowly, as these examples show. The last is in algebraic chess notation; the others show the evolution of descriptive chess notation and use spelling and notation of the period.\n\nA text from Shakespeare's time uses complete sentences to describe moves, for example, \"Then the black king for his second draught brings forth his queene, and placest her in the third house, in front of his bishop's pawne\", which we would now write as 2... Qf6. The great 18th-century player Philidor used an almost equally verbose approach in his influential book \"Analyse du jeu des Échecs\", for example, \"The king's bishop, at his queen bishop's fourth square.\"\n\nAlgebraic chess notation was first used by Philipp Stamma (c. 1705–1755) in an almost fully developed form before the now obsolete descriptive chess notation evolved. The main difference between Stamma's system and the modern system is that Stamma used \"p\" for pawn moves and the original file of the piece (\"a\" through \"h\") instead of the initial letter of the piece.\nIn London in 1747, Philidor convincingly defeated Stamma in a match. Consequently, his writings (which were translated into English) became more influential than Stamma's in the English-speaking chess world; this may have led to the adoption of a descriptive system for writing chess moves, rather than Stamma's coordinate-based approach. However, algebraic notation became popular in Europe following its adoption by the highly influential Handbuch des Schachspiels, and became dominant in Europe during the 20th century. However, it did not become popular in the English-speaking countries until the 1970s.\n\n"}

The main galaxy in \"Star Trek\" consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the United Federation of Planets. \"Star Wars\" depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the Old Republic, inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the Galactic Empire and was again later reformed into a new society called the New Republic after a series of wars.\n\nBoth franchises promote philosophical and political messages.\n\nThe primary philosophies of \"Star Trek\" convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator Gene Roddenberry was inspired by morality tales such as \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nThe primary philosophical messages of \"Star Wars\" are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another. \"Star Wars\" preaches against totalitarian systems and favors societies that offer equality. In an interview on the \"Star Wars\" 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Patrick Stewart stated \"A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of \"Star Wars\" is a very very positive one.\"\n\nThere have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as \"The Outer Limits\" and \"Seaquest\".\n\nBoth franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including Greco-Roman mythology. Many planets and alien species in \"Star Trek\", for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various \"Star Trek\" television series, such as \"Who Mourns for Adonais\", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings. The series also make references to Ancient Babylon and its mythic folklore. The Klingons and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century Mongols.\n\nMuch of \"Star Wars\" story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including classical Greece and Rome, such as the fall of the Old Republic in \"Star Wars\", followed by the rise of the Galactic Empire, which parallels the fall of the ancient Roman Republic followed by the rise of the Roman Empire.\n\nA 1983 documentary on the making of \"Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\" was hosted by Leonard Nimoy, who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.\n\nJ. J. Abrams, director and producer of \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and producer of \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016), directed and produced \"\" (2015). \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as Simon Pegg starred in both series.\n\n\"\" (2002) was poorly received and \"\" (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.\n\nThe newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the United Arab Emirates. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, while scenes for cities in the film \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nThe two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include canonical and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.\n\nDespite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the \"Star Wars\" film series exceed the profit of the \"Star Trek\" film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.\n\nScience fiction writer David Brin criticized \"Star Wars\" at the time of the release of \"The Phantom Menace\", arguing that while the \"Star Wars\" movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with \"Star Wars\" and George Lucas, whom he accused of \"having an agenda\", is that the \"Star Wars\" galaxy is too \"elitist\", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the Galactic Civil War as part of the \"same genetically superior royal family\". He finds the \"Star Wars\" universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that Luke Skywalker killing Palpatine would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.\n\nAmong the many other flaws he sees with \"Star Wars\" is that Anakin Skywalker becomes a hero in the ending of \"Return of the Jedi\" simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, \"Star Trek\" is \"democratic\" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.\n\nWilliam Shatner argues that \"Star Trek\" is superior to \"Star Wars\". According to him, \"\"Star Trek\" had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions.\" Shatner believes that \"Star Wars\" was only better than \"Star Trek\" in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, \"Star Trek\" was able to \"supersede \"Star Wars\" on every level\".\n\nTim Russ, who played Tuvok on \"\", claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that \"Star Trek\" reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. \"Star Wars\" in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the Eastern philosophy of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, \"Star Trek\" comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in \"our\" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas \"Star Wars\" takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.\n\nJeremy Bulloch is best known for his role as Boba Fett in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. He is a huge fan of \"Star Trek: The Original Series\". He argued that while both franchises are popular, \"Star Wars\" comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.\n\nContrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of \"The New York Times\" argued, \"\"Trek\" fandom revolves around technology because the \"Star Trek\" universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and \"Gong Show\"-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. The science in \"Star Wars\" is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because \"Star Wars\" isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second Death Star works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up.\"\n\nJohn Wenzel of \"The Denver Post\" highlighted two differences in approach, noting the \"swashbuckling\" and \"gunslinger\" style of \"Star Wars\" compared with \"Star Trek\"s \"broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity\" and that the spiritual aspect of \"Star Wars\" contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in \"Star Trek\".\n\nBillionaire Peter Thiel told Dowd \"I'm a capitalist. \"Star Wars\" is the capitalist show. \"Star Trek\" is the communist one\". He further stated \"There is no money in \"Star Trek\" because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of \"Star Wars\" starts with Han Solo having this debt that he owes and so the plot in \"Star Wars\" is driven by money.\"\n\nArchived footage in \"Trek Nation\" showed Gene Roddenberry saying, \"I like \"Star Wars\". It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun.\"\n\nThe two franchises have a \"symbiotic relationship\" stated Shatner, who credits \"Star Wars\" for launching the \"Star Trek\" films. He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 \"Star Trek\" fan convention in Las Vegas by stating \"\"Star Wars\" created \"Star Trek\"\". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first \"Star Wars\" film (\"A New Hope\"), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A \"Star Trek\" relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to \"Star Trek\". \"It was \"Star Wars\" that thrust \"Star Trek\" into the people of Paramount's consciousness\" Shatner stated.\n\nThe documentary \"Trek Nation\" features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that \"Star Trek\" was an influence while writing the original screenplay for \"Star Wars\". He explained that while both franchises were so \"far out\", \"Star Trek\" produced a fanbase that \"softened up the entertainment arena\" so that \"Star Wars\" could \"come along and stand on its shoulders.\" This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call \"Star Wars\" a \"derivative\" of \"Star Trek\".\n\nA few references to \"Star Wars\" have been inserted into \"Star Trek\" films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from \"Star Wars\" in both \"Star Trek\" (2009) and \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). Some \"Star Trek\" films and television episodes used the \"Star Wars\" animation shop, Industrial Light & Magic, for their special effects.\n\nWhen Roddenberry was honored at a \"Star Trek\" convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as Darth Vader. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of \"Star Wars\" and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.\n\nWilliam Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.\n\nAt a live concert, Shatner dressed as an imperial stormtrooper singing \"Girl Crush\" alongside Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley.\n\nIn 2011, Shatner and Carrie Fisher posted a series of humorous YouTube videos satirizing each other's franchises.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that Captain Kirk and Princess Leia eloping and running off into the sunset would be the \"perfect union\" between \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\".\n\nShatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his Twitter account mocking \"Star Wars\". Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received \"Star Wars Holiday Special\". It was then that \"Star Wars\" actor Peter Mayhew posted a \"retaliation\" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of \"\", another poorly received film.\n\nBoth franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.\n\n\"Star Trek\" was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the \"Star Trek\" reboot (2009), which was followed by \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013) and \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled \"\", serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on CBS All Access, an online streaming platform, in 2017.\n\n\"Star Wars\" picked up from where \"Return of the Jedi\" left off, with \"\" the first in the new trilogy, and \"\" following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of \"Star Wars Rebels\", a television series set in between the \"Star Wars\" prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone \"Star Wars\" films, starting with \"Rogue One\", which was released in December 2016, and \"\" following in May 2018.\n\nAside from official works by the producers of \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\", many fan films and webisodes set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered canon in relation to either franchise.\n\n"}
{"id": "462524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462524", "title": "Countdown", "text": "Countdown\n\nA countdown is a sequence of backward counting to indicate the time remaining before an event is scheduled to occur. NASA commonly employs the terms \"L-minus\" and \"T-minus\" during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch, and even \"E-minus\" for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space, where the \"T\" could stand for \"Test\" or \"Time\", and the \"E\" stands for \"Encounter\", as with a comet or some other space object. Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive, the start of a race, the start of the New Year, or any anxiously anticipated event. An early use of a countdown once signaled the start of a Cambridge University rowing race. One of the first known associations with rockets was in the 1929 German science fiction movie \"Frau im Mond\" (English: \"Woman in the Moon\") written by Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang in an attempt to increase the drama of the launch sequence of the story's lunar-bound rocket.\n\nA countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with the ignition of a rocket's engine. Depending on the type of vehicle used, countdowns can start from 72 to 96 hours before launch time.\n\nDuring countdown:\n\nThe procedures for each launch are written carefully. For the Space Shuttle, a five-volume set, Shuttle Countdown (KSC S0007), often referred to as \"S0007\", was used. Rosie Carver, a technical writer for United Launch Alliance, has created at least 15,000 procedures for more than 300 missions since the Solar Maximum Mission, which launched Feb. 14, 1980. These documents are living documents, which reflect new issues and solutions as they develop. Each mission requires approximately 100 procedure books.\n\nProceeding with the countdown depends on several factors, such as the proper launch window, weather that permits a safe launch, and the rocket and payload working properly.\nThe launch weather guidelines involving the Space Shuttle and expendable rockets are similar in many areas, but a distinction is made for the individual characteristics of each. The criteria are broadly conservative and assure avoidance of possibly adverse conditions. They are reviewed for each launch. For the Space Shuttle, weather \"outlooks\" provided by the U. S. Air Force Range Weather Operations Facility at Cape Canaveral began at Launch minus 5 days in coordination with the NOAA National Weather Service Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These include weather trends and their possible effects on launch day. A formal prelaunch weather briefing was held on Launch minus 1 day, which is a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations.\n\nThe launch window is a precise time during which aerospace personnel launch a rocket so the payload can reach the proper orbital destination.\n\nA hold is the suspension of the normal countdown process. This can be done to investigate a technical process that has gone wrong, or because of marginal weather at the launch pad.\n\nSome holds are planned: they are done so the launch-support computers can run automatic checks on the rocket.\n\nUnder some circumstances, a countdown may be recycled to an earlier time. When that happens, launch personnel begin following the countdown checklist from the earlier point.\n\nDuring communications for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open as much as possible. All Firing Room console positions are assigned unique 'call signs' that are used by the team for quick and positive identification of who is talking. For example, dialogue heard during the launch of a Delta II rocket carrying the Kepler Space Telescope on March 8, 2009, included:\n\nTime: T minus 3 minutes. <br>\nLaunch Control (LC): , third stage arm permit to close. <br>\nOSM: Closed. <br>\nLC: , third stage S&A armed. <br>\nSSC: Armed. <br>\nLC: Prop 1, vehicle fuel tank press open. <br>\nProp 1: Open. <br>\nLC: Fuel umbilical purge to open. <br>\nProp 1: Open. <br>\nLC: SSC, vent 1 heater control exit. <br>\nSSC: Exit. <br>\nLC: SSC, vent 2 heater control exit. <br>\nSSC: Exit. <br>\nLC: NSC reports spacecraft is go. <br>\nMission Director: Kepler spacecraft is go. <br>\nLC: SSC - FTS bat one and two heater controls heaters off. <br>\nSSC: Off. <br>\nLC: Prop 1, pressurized first stage LOX tanks to relief. <br>\nProp 1: Pressurized. <br>\nLC: Prop 2, top first stage LOX to 100 percent levels. <br>\nProp 2: Up and down, 100 percent. <br>\nTime: Ninety seconds. <br>\nLC: SSC, hydraulic external power to on. <br>\nSSC: External. <br>\nTime: Eighty seconds. <br>\nLC: RCO, report range go for launch. <br>\nRange Control Officer (RCO): Range go for launch. <br>\nMission Director: LC (Viera), you're go for launch. <br>\nLC: Roger. <br>\n\nIn the context of a rocket launch, the \"L minus Time\" is the physical time before launch, e.g. \"L minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds\". \"T minus Time\" is a system to mark points at which actions necessary for the launch are planned - this time stops and starts as various hold points are entered, and so doesn't show the actual time to launch. The last ten seconds are usually counted down aloud \"Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.\" After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show Mission Elapsed Time, which is typically shown as \"T plus.\" The adjacent picture shows \"+ 00:00:07\", approximately seven seconds after liftoff.\n\nIn Fritz Lang's film \"Frau im Mond\", after each number the phrase \"seconds to go\" was repeated.\n\nWhen counting down to the launch of an explosive, e.g. when testing a new model of gun, it is customary to omit \"5\" from the countdown sequence because \"five\" sounds too similar to 'Fire!'\n\nAt the start of films, a countdown sequence is printed on the head leader, and is used to synchronize film reel changeovers (switching between reels of film). In film (but not television) the 'Academy Leader' countdown first used in 1930 is in units of feet rather than time units; it starts at 11 and ends at 3 where it cuts to black for the last few feet. In 1959, SMPTE leader was created and measures seconds, not feet. It starts at 8 and cuts to black on the first frame of 2, which is accompanied by a 'pop. This leader eventually displaced the older Academy and was the only leader used by the end of the optical projection era.\n\nIn many New Year's Eve celebrations, there is a countdown during the last seconds of the old year until the beginning of the new year.\n\nIn Times Square on New Year's Eve, besides the 60-Second Countdown at 11:59 P.M., there are six 20-second hourly countdowns in which people can practice their countdown skills from 5:59 P.M. to 10:59 P.M. The aforementioned countdowns are also the countdowns to the end of each hour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46198748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46198748", "title": "Covert facial recognition", "text": "Covert facial recognition\n\nJoachim Bodamer created the term prosopagnosia in 1947, which is a disorder where individuals have an inability to recognize faces of people. Individuals with this disorder do not have the ability to overtly recognize faces, but discoveries have been made showing that people with this disorder have the ability to covertly recognize faces. Covert facial recognition is the unconscious recognition of familiar faces by people with prosopagnosia. The individuals who express this phenomenon are unaware that they are recognizing the faces of people they have seen before.\n\nThere are two types of prosopagnosia, congenital and acquired. Congenital prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize faces without a history of brain damage; while acquired prosopagnosia is caused by damage to the right occipital-temporal region of the brain. In the 1950s it was theorized that the right cerebral hemisphere was involved in facial recognition and in the 1960s this theory was supported by many experiments.\n\nAlthough the ability for overt facial recognition is inhibited in patients with prosopagnosia, there have been many studies done which show that some of these individuals may have the ability to recognize familiar faces covertly. These experiments have used behavioral and physiological measures in order to demonstrate covert facial recognition. A common physiological measure that is used is the measure of autonomic activity by using skin-conductance responses (SCR) which show a larger response in individuals with prosopagnosia who are shown pictures of familiar faces compared to pictures of unfamiliar faces.\n\nMany theories reside in the topic of cognitive facial recognition. First, the theory of contradiction between prosopagnosia and covert recognition. Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces but is believed to stem from damage to the ventral route of the visual system. Whereas covert recognition is shown in people that lost their ability to recognize faces, implying an intact ventral limbic structure projecting to the amygdala.\n\nTheory two states that it cannot be observed in developmental cases of prosopagnosia, which was proposed by Grueter. Developmental prosopagnosia is a severe face processing impairment without brain damage and visual or thinking dysfunction but can sometimes run in families (some indications that there may be a genetic reason for the disorder). This theory is thought to rely on the activation of face representations created during the time of normal processing.\n\nContradicting the last theory, the affective valence in developmental prosopagnosia theory states that individuals may be processing faces on affective dimensions, feelings and emotions, rather than familiarity dimensions, previous occasions and when they met.\n\nNext is the dual-route models theory, proposed by Bauer, and states covert recognition can be seen in people that endured a time of normal face processing before actually getting the condition. With this, there are two different types of covert recognition: behavioral and physiological. Behavioral covert recognition is measured by reaction time and occurs within a cognitive pathway consisting of face recognition units (FRUs), personality identity units (PINs) and semantic information units. Physiological covert recognition is measured by SCR and is the second route that mediates reactions to familiar faces. This theory can be explained by the disconnection of FRUs or that it may be that the face recognition system is intact but has been disconnected from a higher system enabling their conscious awareness.\n\nThe parallel distributing process is a theory that proposes it would be easier to relearn previous known faces rather than to learn new ones. This process has three steps: the distributed information is represented, memory and knowledge for some things are not stored explicitly but are connected between nodes, learning can occur with gradual changes to the connections. Damaged networks are less effective by zeroing the weight of the connection. Each connection is embedded and is still faintly there, making it easier to relearn.\n\nOther theories include one proposed by Bauer, states that neurological routes mediate overt recognition. His theory went with Bruce and Young’s theory that when using these three sequential stages in order, each stage will affect the next with overt mediation. The three stages are familiarity, occupation and name retrieval.\n\nOne of the very first studies into the diversion of pathways of overt and covert facial processing was done by Bauer in 1984. This study has been the basis for most of the other studies and literature that has been conducted on the topic of prosopagnosia and covert processing. Three other larger studies were performed. Event-related potential studies were done with 20 subjects who were clear of psychological disorders. This was a face study using 315 faces and a string of characters. In each trial 30 of the faces were familiar and 90 novel faces were shown. Then, the 315 faces were shown and subjects were asked which were familiar. The faces were shown again from the first trial but without a string of letters. This resulted in higher load results for overt recognition with longer reaction time. High load tasks led to the ability to recall far fewer faces when the task was performed.\n\nThe second study was directly into covert facial recognition in prosopagnosia. In this study faces were taken from a set of 166 faces, hair and background were removed. In the first task, 36 pictures were shown, half actors and have politicians. When the face was shown the subject was asked if it was a politician or actor. Both the control and prosopagnosia patients were able to identify which faces were which therefore reaction time was compared. The second task was to say which of the faces were famous in a set of forty famous and forty non-famous. Prosopagnosia subjects had little ability to make this distinction. Further, the third task also showed forty famous faces but instead of a random string written names were used. The faces remained until one was decided upon to match the name. The covert recognition was only present in two tasks. This was not on the first task which was meant to prime and lead to the fact that the prime may be the impairment of prosopagnosia. SCR tests are often used to test covert facial processing but none of the experiments displayed significant results\n\nThere are several problems that may damage the ability to properly perceive faces, many of these don’t have effects on both the covert and overt recognition of faces. Many of these problems only have an effect on the overt recognition of faces and leave the covert recognition intact.\n\nProsopagnosia is a disorder which causes the inability to use overt facial recognition. While people suffering from prosopagnosia often cannot identify whose face they are looking at they usually show signs of covert recognition. This can be seen in their ability to accurately guess information during forced choice tasks. Patients who are unable to identify faces of people that they know are still able to accurately guess information on the owners of the faces such as their professions and names. When asked how confident of their answers the patients were, they would often give low ratings of confidence despite their high accuracy during the tests. This shows that they are unable to overtly recognize the face but they are still able to recall information on the owners despite the fact that they can’t identify the owner.\n\nWhile prosopagnosia patients are unable to overtly recognize faces, patients with Capgras delusion are unable to covertly recognize faces. People suffering from Capgras delusion are able to properly identify a face, but lack the covert recognition that is normally evoked by a familiar face. Before the delusion set in patients would normally have a sensation of familiarity and have a heightened response to faces that they recognize. Once the delusion has set in the patients no longer feel that the face they are looking at is familiar to them and they can’t access the feelings they normally held for the owner of the face despite the fact that they can properly identify who the face belongs to. This condition causes patients with Capgras delusion to believe that the person has been replaced with a look-alike imposter.\n\n"}

While the term \"mulatto\" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or upper-middle class, and therefore assimilates easily into traditionally white environments. \n\nEllis writes, \"Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world\" (235). Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status upward mobility.\n\nExamples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2937104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2937104", "title": "Dual-sector model", "text": "Dual-sector model\n\nThe dual-sector model is a model in developmental economics. It is commonly known as the Lewis model after its inventor W. Arthur Lewis. It explains the growth of a developing economy in terms of a labour transition between two sectors, the capitalist sector and the subsistence sector.\n\nInitially the dual-sector model as given by W. Arthur Lewis was enumerated in his article entitled \"Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labor\" written in 1954, the model itself was named in Lewis's honor. First published in \"The Manchester School\" in May 1954, the article and the subsequent model were instrumental in laying the foundation for the field of developmental economics. The article itself has been characterized by some as the most influential contribution to the establishment of the discipline.\n\n\nW. A. Lewis divided the economy of an underdeveloped country into 2 sectors:\n\nLewis defined this sector as \"that part of the economy which uses reproducible capital and pays capitalists thereof\". The use of capital is controlled by the capitalists, who hire the services of labour. It includes manufacturing, plantations, mines etc.\nThe capitalist sector may be private or public.\n\nThis sector was defined by him as \"that part of the economy which is not using reproducible capital\". It can also be adjusted as the indigenous traditional sector or the \"self employed sector\". The per head output is comparatively lower in this sector and this is because it is not fructified with capital. The \"Dual Sector Model\" is a theory of development in which surplus labor from traditional agricultural sector is transferred to the modern industrial sector whose growth over time absorbs the surplus labour, promotes industrialization and stimulates sustained development.\n\nIn the model, the subsistence agricultural sector is typically characterized by low wages, an abundance of labour, and low productivity through a labour-intensive production process. In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing sector is defined by higher wage rates as compared to the subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist sector is assumed to use a production process that is capital intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing sector are possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the marginal productivity of labour in the agricultural sector is assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe primary relationship between the two sectors is that when the capitalist sector expands, it extracts or draws labour from the subsistence sector. This causes the output per head of labourers who move from the subsistence sector to the capitalist sector to increase. Since Lewis in his model considers overpopulated labour surplus economies he assumes that the supply of unskilled labour to the capitalist sector is unlimited.\nThis gives rise to the possibility of creating new industries and expanding existing ones at the existing wage rate.\nA large portion of the unlimited supply of labor consists of those who are in disguised unemployment in agriculture and in other over-manned occupations such as domestic services casual jobs, petty retail trading. Lewis also accounts for two other factors that cause an increase in the supply of unskilled labour, they are women in the household and population growth.\n\nThe agricultural sector has a limited amount of land to cultivate, the marginal product of an additional farmer is assumed to be zero as the law of diminishing marginal returns has run its course due to the fixed input, land. As a result, the agricultural sector has a quantity of farm workers that are not contributing to agricultural output since their marginal productivities are zero. This group of farmers that is not producing any output is termed surplus labour since this cohort could be moved to another sector with no effect on agricultural output. (The term surplus labour here is not being used in a Marxist context and only refers to the unproductive workers in the agricultural sector.) Therefore, due to the wage differential between the capitalist and subsistence sector, workers will tend to transition from the agricultural to the manufacturing sector over time to reap the reward of higher wages.\nHowever even though the marginal product of labor is zero, it still shares a part in the total product and receives approximately the average product.\n\nIf a quantity of workers moves from the subsistence to the capitalist sector equal to the quantity of surplus labour in the subsistence sector, regardless of who actually transfers, general welfare and productivity will improve. Total agricultural product will remain unchanged while total industrial product increases due to the addition of labour, but the additional labour also drives down marginal productivity and wages in the manufacturing sector. Over time as this transition continues to take place and investment results in increases in the capital stock, the marginal productivity of workers in the manufacturing will be driven up by capital formation and driven down by additional workers entering the manufacturing sector. Eventually, the wage rates of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors will equalize as workers leave the agriculture sector for the manufacturing sector, increasing marginal productivity and wages in agriculture whilst driving down productivity and wages in manufacturing.\n\nThe end result of this transition process is that the agricultural wage equals the manufacturing wage, the agricultural marginal product of labour equals the manufacturing marginal product of labour, and no further manufacturing sector enlargement takes place as workers no longer have a monetary incentive to transition.\n\nSurplus labour can be used instead of capital in the creation of new industrial investment projects, or it can be channeled into nascent industries, which are labour-intensive in their early stages. Such growth does not raise the value of the subsistence wage, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand at that wage, and rising production via improved labour techniques has the effect of lowering the capital coefficient.\nAlthough labour is assumed to be in surplus, it is mainly unskilled. This inhibits growth since technical progress necessary for growth requires skilled labor. But should there be a labor surplus and a modest capital, this bottleneck can be broken through the provision of training and education facilities.\nThe utility of unlimited supplies of labour to growth objectives depends upon the amount of capital available at the same time. Should there be surplus labour, agriculture will derive no productive use from it, so a transfer to a non agriculture sector will be of mutual benefit. It provides jobs to the agrarian population and reduces the burden of population from land. Industry now obtains its labour. Labour must be encouraged to move to increase productivity in agriculture. To start such a movement, the capitalist sector will have to pay a compensatory payment determined by the wage rate that people can earn outside their present sector, plus a set of other amounts includes the cost of living in the new sector and changes in the level of profits in the existing sector. The margin capitalists may have to pay is as much as 30 per cent above the average subsistence wage, WW1 in figure which represents the capitalist sector is shown by N; OW is the industrial wage. Given the profit maximization assumption, employment of labor within the industrial sector is given by the point where marginal product is equal to the rate of wages, i.e. OM.\n\nSince the wages in the capitalist sector depend on the earnings of the subsistence sector, capitalists would like to keep down productivity/wages in the subsistence sector, so that the capitalist sector may expand at a fixed wage. In the capitalist sector labor is employed up to the point where its marginal product equals wage, since a capitalist employer would be reducing his surplus if he paid labor more than he received for what is produced. But this need not be true in subsistence agriculture as wages could be equal to average product or the level of subsistence. The total product labor ONPM is divided between the payments to labor in the form of wages, OWPM, and the capitalist surplus, NPW. The growth of the capitalist sector and the rate of labor absorption from the subsistence sector depends on the use made of capitalist surplus. When the surplus is reinvested, the total product of labor will rise. The marginal product line shifts upwards to the right, that is to N1. Assuming wages are constant, the industrial sector now provides more employment. Hence employment rises by MM1. The amount of capitalist surplus goes up from WNP to WN1P'. This amount can now be reinvested and the process will be repeated and all the surplus labor would eventually be exhausted. When all the surplus labor in the subsistence sector has been attracted into the capitalist sector, wages in the subsistence sector will begin to rise, shifting the terms of trade in favor of agriculture, and causing wages in the capitalist sector to rise. Capital accumulation has caught up with the population and there is no longer scope for development from the initial source, i.e. unlimited supplies of labor. When all the surplus labor is exhausted, the supply of labor to the industrial sector becomes less than perfectly elastic. It is now in the interests of producers in the subsistence sector to compete for labor as the agricultural sector has become fully commercialized. It is the increase in the share of profits in the capitalist sector which ensures that labor surplus is continuously utilized and eventually exhausted. Real wages will tend to rise along with increases in productivity and the economy will enter into a stage of self-sustaining growth with a consistent nature.\n\nThe process of economic growth is inextricably linked to the growth of capitalist surplus, that is as long as the capitalist surplus increases, the national income also increases raising the growth of the economy. The increase in capitalist surplus is linked to the use of more and more labor which is assumed to be in surplus in case of this model. This process of capital accumulation does come to an end at some point.\n\nThis point is where capital accumulation catches up with population so that there is no longer any surplus labor left. Lewis says that it the point where capital accumulation comes to a stop can come before also that is if real wages rise so high so as to reduce capitalists' profits to the level at which profits are all consumed and there is no net investment.\n\nThis can take place in the following ways:\n\nThe Lewis model has attracted attention of underdeveloped countries because it brings out some basic relationships in dualistic development. However it has been criticized on the following grounds:\n\n\nThe model assumes rationality, perfect information and unlimited capital formation in industry. These do not exist in practical situations and so the full extent of the model is rarely realised. However, the model does provide a good general theory on labour transitioning in developing economies.\n\n\nThis model has been employed quite successfully in Singapore. Ironically however it has not been employed in Sir Arthur Lewis' home country of St. Lucia.\n\n"}

The quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is singular homology, developed by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod.\n\nOne can define a homology theory as a sequence of functors satisfying the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. The axiomatic approach, which was developed in 1945, allows one to prove results, such as the Mayer–Vietoris sequence, that are common to all homology theories satisfying the axioms.\n\nIf one omits the dimension axiom (described below), then the remaining axioms define what is called an extraordinary homology theory. Extraordinary cohomology theories first arose in K-theory and cobordism.\n\nThe Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms apply to a sequence of functors formula_1 from the category of pairs (\"X\", \"A\") of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups, together with a natural transformation formula_2 called the boundary map (here \"H\"(\"A\") is a shorthand for \"H\"(\"A\",∅)).

{"id": "221537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221537", "title": "Exterior algebra", "text": "Exterior algebra\n\nIn mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors \"u\" and \"v\", denoted by , is called a bivector and lives in a space called the \"exterior square\", a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors. The magnitude of can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides \"u\" and \"v\", which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. Like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that for all vectors \"u\" and \"v\", but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is associative. One way to visualize a bivector is as a family of parallelograms all lying in the same plane, having the same area, and with the same orientation—a choice of clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nWhen regarded in this manner, the exterior product of two vectors is called a 2-blade. More generally, the exterior product of any number \"k\" of vectors can be defined and is sometimes called a \"k\"-blade. It lives in a space known as the \"k\"th exterior power. The magnitude of the resulting \"k\"-blade is the volume of the \"k\"-dimensional parallelotope whose edges are the given vectors, just as the magnitude of the scalar triple product of vectors in three dimensions gives the volume of the parallelepiped generated by those vectors.\n\nThe exterior algebra, or Grassmann algebra after Hermann Grassmann, is the algebraic system whose product is the exterior product. The exterior algebra provides an algebraic setting in which to answer geometric questions. For instance, blades have a concrete geometric interpretation, and objects in the exterior algebra can be manipulated according to a set of unambiguous rules. The exterior algebra contains objects that are not only \"k\"-blades, but sums of \"k\"-blades; such a sum is called a \"k\"-vector. The \"k\"-blades, because they are simple products of vectors, are called the simple elements of the algebra. The \"rank\" of any \"k\"-vector is defined to be the smallest number of simple elements of which it is a sum. The exterior product extends to the full exterior algebra, so that it makes sense to multiply any two elements of the algebra. Equipped with this product, the exterior algebra is an associative algebra, which means that for any elements \"α\", \"β\", \"γ\". The \"k\"-vectors have degree \"k\", meaning that they are sums of products of \"k\" vectors. When elements of different degrees are multiplied, the degrees add like multiplication of polynomials. This means that the exterior algebra is a graded algebra.\n\nThe definition of the exterior algebra makes sense for spaces not just of geometric vectors, but of other vector-like objects such as vector fields or functions. In full generality, the exterior algebra can be defined for modules over a commutative ring, and for other structures of interest in abstract algebra. It is one of these more general constructions where the exterior algebra finds one of its most important applications, where it appears as the algebra of differential forms that is fundamental in areas that use differential geometry. Differential forms are mathematical objects that represent infinitesimal areas of infinitesimal parallelograms (and higher-dimensional bodies), and so can be integrated over surfaces and higher dimensional manifolds in a way that generalizes the line integrals from calculus. The exterior algebra also has many algebraic properties that make it a convenient tool in algebra itself. The association of the exterior algebra to a vector space is a type of functor on vector spaces, which means that it is compatible in a certain way with linear transformations of vector spaces. The exterior algebra is one example of a bialgebra, meaning that its dual space also possesses a product, and this dual product is compatible with the exterior product. This dual algebra is precisely the algebra of alternating multilinear forms, and the pairing between the exterior algebra and its dual is given by the interior product.\n\nThe Cartesian plane R is a vector space equipped with a basis consisting of a pair of unit vectors\n\nSuppose that\n\nare a pair of given vectors in R, written in components. There is a unique parallelogram having v and w as two of its sides. The \"area\" of this parallelogram is given by the standard determinant formula:\n\nConsider now the exterior product of v and w:\n\nwhere the first step uses the distributive law for the exterior product, and the last uses the fact that the exterior product is alternating, and in particular . (Note that the fact that the exterior product is alternating also forces formula_5.) Note that the coefficient in this last expression is precisely the determinant of the matrix . The fact that this may be positive or negative has the intuitive meaning that v and w may be oriented in a counterclockwise or clockwise sense as the vertices of the parallelogram they define. Such an area is called the \"signed area\" of the parallelogram: the absolute value of the signed area is the ordinary area, and the sign determines its orientation.\n\nThe fact that this coefficient is the signed area is not an accident. In fact, it is relatively easy to see that the exterior product should be related to the signed area if one tries to axiomatize this area as an algebraic construct. In detail, if denotes the signed area of the parallelogram of which the pair of vectors v and w form two adjacent sides, then A must satisfy the following properties:\nWith the exception of the last property, the exterior product of two vectors satisfies the same properties as the area. In a certain sense, the exterior product generalizes the final property by allowing the area of a parallelogram to be compared to that of any \"standard\" chosen parallelogram in a parallel plane (here, the one with sides e and e). In other words, the exterior product provides a \"basis-independent\" formulation of area.\n\nFor vectors in R, the exterior algebra is closely related to the cross product and triple product. Using the standard basis the exterior product of a pair of vectors\n\nand\n\nis\n\nwhere {e ∧ e, e ∧ e, e ∧ e} is the basis for the three-dimensional space Λ(R). The coefficients above are the same as those in the usual definition of the cross product of vectors in three dimensions, the only difference being that the exterior product is not an ordinary vector, but instead is a 2-vector.\n\nBringing in a third vector\n\nthe exterior product of three vectors is\n\nwhere is the basis vector for the one-dimensional space Λ(R). The scalar coefficient is the triple product of the three vectors.\n\nThe cross product and triple product in three dimensions each admit both geometric and algebraic interpretations. The cross product can be interpreted as a vector which is perpendicular to both u and v and whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by the two vectors. It can also be interpreted as the vector consisting of the minors of the matrix with columns u and v. The triple product of u, v, and w is geometrically a (signed) volume. Algebraically, it is the determinant of the matrix with columns u, v, and w. The exterior product in three dimensions allows for similar interpretations: it, too, can be identified with oriented areas or volumes spanned by the two or three vectors involved. In fact, in the presence of a positively oriented orthonormal basis, the exterior product generalizes these geometric notions to higher dimensions.\n\nThe exterior algebra of a vector space over a field is defined as the quotient algebra of the tensor algebra by the two-sided ideal generated by all elements of the form for (i.e. all tensors that can be expressed as the tensor product of a vector in by itself). Symbolically,\n\nThe exterior product of two elements of is the product induced by the tensor product of . That is, if\nis the canonical surjection, and and are in , then there are formula_13 and formula_14 in such that formula_15 and formula_16 and\nIt results from the definition of a quotient algebra that the value of formula_18 does not depend of a particular choice of formula_13 and formula_20\n\nAs , , and formula_21, the inclusions of and in induce injections of and into . These injections are commonly considered as inclusions, and called \"natural embeddings\", \"natural injections\" or \"natural inclusions\". The word \"canonical\" is also commonly used in place of \"natural\".\n\nThe exterior product is by construction \"alternating\" on elements of \"V\", which means that for all , by the above construction. It follows that the product is also anticommutative on elements of \"V\", for supposing that ,\n\nhence\n\nMore generally, if \"σ\" is a permutation of the integers , and \"x\", \"x\", ..., \"x\" are elements of \"V\", it follows that\n\nwhere sgn(\"σ\") is the signature of the permutation \"σ\".\n\nIn particular, if \"x\" = \"x\" for some , then the following generalization of the alternating property also holds:\n\nThe \"k\"th exterior power of \"V\", denoted Λ(\"V\"), is the vector subspace of Λ(\"V\") spanned by elements of the form\n\nIf , then \"α\" is said to be a \"k\"-vector. If, furthermore, \"α\" can be expressed as an exterior product of \"k\" elements of \"V\", then \"α\" is said to be decomposable. Although decomposable \"k\"-vectors span Λ(\"V\"), not every element of Λ(\"V\") is decomposable. For example, in R, the following 2-vector is not decomposable:\n\nIf the dimension of \"V\" is \"n\" and is a basis of \"V\", then the set\nis a basis for Λ(\"V\"). The reason is the following: given any exterior product of the form\nevery vector \"v\" can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors \"e\"; using the bilinearity of the exterior product, this can be expanded to a linear combination of exterior products of those basis vectors. Any exterior product in which the same basis vector appears more than once is zero; any exterior product in which the basis vectors do not appear in the proper order can be reordered, changing the sign whenever two basis vectors change places. In general, the resulting coefficients of the basis \"k\"-vectors can be computed as the minors of the matrix that describes the vectors \"v\" in terms of the basis \"e\".\n\nBy counting the basis elements, the dimension of Λ(\"V\") is equal to a binomial coefficient:\nIn particular, for .\n\nAny element of the exterior algebra can be written as a sum of \"k\"-vectors. Hence, as a vector space the exterior algebra is a direct sum\n(where by convention and ), and therefore its dimension is equal to the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 2.\n\nIf , then it is possible to express \"α\" as a linear combination of decomposable \"k\"-vectors:\n\nwhere each \"α\" is decomposable, say\n\nThe rank of the \"k\"-vector \"α\" is the minimal number of decomposable \"k\"-vectors in such an expansion of \"α\". This is similar to the notion of tensor rank.\n\nRank is particularly important in the study of 2-vectors . The rank of a 2-vector \"α\" can be identified with half the rank of the matrix of coefficients of \"α\" in a basis. Thus if \"e\" is a basis for \"V\", then \"α\" can be expressed uniquely as\n\nwhere (the matrix of coefficients is skew-symmetric). The rank of the matrix \"a\" is therefore even, and is twice the rank of the form \"α\".\n\nIn characteristic 0, the 2-vector \"α\" has rank \"p\" if and only if\n\nand\n\nThe exterior product of a \"k\"-vector with a \"p\"-vector is a -vector, once again invoking bilinearity. As a consequence, the direct sum decomposition of the preceding section\n\ngives the exterior algebra the additional structure of a graded algebra, that is\n\nMoreover, if is the basis field, we have\nand\n\nThe exterior product is graded anticommutative, meaning that if and , then\n\nIn addition to studying the graded structure on the exterior algebra, studies additional graded structures on exterior algebras, such as those on the exterior algebra of a graded module (a module that already carries its own gradation).\n\nLet be a vector space over the field . Informally, multiplication in is performed by manipulating symbols and imposing a distributive law, an associative law, and using the identity for . Formally, is the \"most general\" algebra in which these rules hold for the multiplication, in the sense that any unital associative -algebra containing with alternating multiplication on must contain a homomorphic image of . In other words, the exterior algebra has the following universal property:\n\nTo construct the most general algebra that contains and whose multiplication is alternating on , it is natural to start with the most general associative algebra that contains , the tensor algebra , and then enforce the alternating property by taking a suitable quotient. We thus take the two-sided ideal in generated by all elements of the form for in , and define as the quotient\n\n(and use as the symbol for multiplication in . It is then straightforward to show that contains and satisfies the above universal property.\n\nAs a consequence of this construction, the operation of assigning to a vector space its exterior algebra is a functor from the category of vector spaces to the category of algebras.\n\nRather than defining first and then identifying the exterior powers as certain subspaces, one may alternatively define the spaces first and then combine them to form the algebra . This approach is often used in differential geometry and is described in the next section.\n\nGiven a commutative ring \"R\" and an \"R\"-module \"M\", we can define the exterior algebra Λ(\"M\") just as above, as a suitable quotient of the tensor algebra T(\"M\"). It will satisfy the analogous universal property. Many of the properties of Λ(\"M\") also require that \"M\" be a projective module. Where finite dimensionality is used, the properties further require that \"M\" be finitely generated and projective. Generalizations to the most common situations can be found in .\n\nExterior algebras of vector bundles are frequently considered in geometry and topology. There are no essential differences between the algebraic properties of the exterior algebra of finite-dimensional vector bundles and those of the exterior algebra of finitely generated projective modules, by the Serre–Swan theorem. More general exterior algebras can be defined for sheaves of modules.\n\nGiven two vector spaces \"V\" and \"X\", an alternating operator from \"V\" to \"X\" is a multilinear map\n\nsuch that whenever \"v\", ..., \"v\" are linearly dependent vectors in \"V\", then\n\nThe map\n\nwhich associates to \"k\" vectors from \"V\" their exterior product, i.e. their corresponding \"k\"-vector, is also alternating. In fact, this map is the \"most general\" alternating operator defined on \"V\": given any other alternating operator , there exists a unique linear map with . This universal property characterizes the space Λ(\"V\") and can serve as its definition.\n\nThe above discussion specializes to the case when , the base field. In this case an alternating multilinear function\nis called an alternating multilinear form. The set of all alternating multilinear forms is a vector space, as the sum of two such maps, or the product of such a map with a scalar, is again alternating. By the universal property of the exterior power, the space of alternating forms of degree \"k\" on \"V\" is naturally isomorphic with the dual vector space (Λ\"V\"). If \"V\" is finite-dimensional, then the latter is naturally isomorphic to Λ(\"V\"). In particular, the dimension of the space of alternating maps from \"V\" to \"K\" is \"n\" choose \"k\".\n\nUnder this identification, the exterior product takes a concrete form: it produces a new anti-symmetric map from two given ones. Suppose and are two anti-symmetric maps. As in the case of tensor products of multilinear maps, the number of variables of their exterior product is the sum of the numbers of their variables. It is defined as follows:\n\nwhere the alternation Alt of a multilinear map is defined to be the average of the sign-adjusted values over all the permutations of its variables:\n\nThis definition of the exterior product is well-defined even if the field \"K\" has finite characteristic, if one considers an equivalent version of the above that does not use factorials or any constants:\n\nwhere here is the subset of (\"k\",\"m\") shuffles: permutations \"σ\" of the set such that , and .\n\nThere is a correspondence between the graded dual of the graded algebra Λ(\"V\") and alternating multilinear forms on \"V\". The exterior algebra (as well as the symmetric algebra) inherits a bialgebra structure, and, indeed, a Hopf algebra structure, from the tensor algebra. See the article on tensor algebras for a detailed treatment of the topic.\n\nThe exterior product of multilinear forms defined above is dual to a coproduct defined on Λ(\"V\"), giving the structure of a coalgebra. The coproduct is a linear function which is given by\n\non elements \"v\"∈\"V\". The symbol 1 stands for the unit element of the field \"K\". Recall that so that the above really does lie in This definition of the coproduct is extended to the full space Λ(\"V\") by (linear) homomorphism. That is, for \"v\",\"w\"∈\"V\", one has, by definition, the homomorphism\n\nThe correct form of this homomorphism is not what one might naively write, but has to be the one carefully defined in the coalgebra article. In this case, one obtains\n\nExtending to the full space Λ(\"V\"), one has, in general,\n\nExpanding this out in detail, one obtains the following expression on decomposable elements:\n\nwhere the second summation is taken over all -shuffles. The above is written with a notational trick, to keep track of the field element 1: the trick is to write formula_55, and this is shuffled into various locations during the expansion of the sum over shuffles. The shuffle follows directly from the first axiom of a co-algebra: the relative order of the elements formula_56 is \"preserved\" in the riffle shuffle: the riffle shuffle merely splits the ordered sequence into two ordered sequences, one on the left, and one on the right.\n\nObserve that the coproduct preserves the grading of the algebra. That is, one has that\n\nThe tensor symbol ⊗ used in this section should be understood with some caution: it is \"not\" the same tensor symbol as the one being used in the definition of the alternating product. Intuitively, it is perhaps easiest to think it as just another, but different, tensor product: it is still (bi-)linear, as tensor products should be, but it is the product that is appropriate for the definition of a bialgebra, that is, for creating the object Any lingering doubt can be shaken by pondering the equalities and , which follow from the definition of the coalgebra, as opposed to naive manipulations involving the tensor and wedge symbols. This distinction is developed in greater detail in the article on tensor algebras. Here, there is much less of a problem, in that the alternating product Λ clearly corresponds to multiplication in the bialgebra, leaving the symbol ⊗ free for use in the definition of the bialgebra. In practice, this presents no particular problem, as long as one avoids the fatal trap of replacing alternating sums of ⊗ by the wedge symbol, with one exception. One can construct an alternating product from ⊗, with the understanding that it works in a different space. Immediately below, an example is given: the alternating product for the \"dual space\" can be given in terms of the coproduct. The construction of the bialgebra here parallels the construction in the tensor algebra article almost exactly, except for the need to correctly track the alternating signs for the exterior algebra.\n\nIn terms of the coproduct, the exterior product on the dual space is just the graded dual of the coproduct:\n\nwhere the tensor product on the right-hand side is of multilinear linear maps (extended by zero on elements of incompatible homogeneous degree: more precisely, , where \"ε\" is the counit, as defined presently).\n\nThe counit is the homomorphism that returns the 0-graded component of its argument. The coproduct and counit, along with the exterior product, define the structure of a bialgebra on the exterior algebra.\n\nWith an antipode defined on homogeneous elements by formula_59, the exterior algebra is furthermore a Hopf algebra.\n\nSuppose that \"V\" is finite-dimensional. If \"V\" denotes the dual space to the vector space \"V\", then for each , it is possible to define an antiderivation on the algebra Λ(\"V\"),\n\nThis derivation is called the interior product with \"α\", or sometimes the insertion operator, or contraction by \"α\".\n\nSuppose that . Then w is a multilinear mapping of \"V\" to \"K\", so it is defined by its values on the \"k\"-fold Cartesian product . If \"u\", \"u\", ..., \"u\" are elements of \"V\", then define\n\nAdditionally, let whenever \"f\" is a pure scalar (i.e., belonging to Λ\"V\").\n\nThe interior product satisfies the following properties:\n\n\nThese three properties are sufficient to characterize the interior product as well as define it in the general infinite-dimensional case.\n\nFurther properties of the interior product include:\n\nSuppose that \"V\" has finite dimension \"n\". Then the interior product induces a canonical isomorphism of vector spaces\nby the recursive definition\n\nIn the geometrical setting, a non-zero element of the top exterior power Λ(\"V\") (which is a one-dimensional vector space) is sometimes called a volume form (or orientation form, although this term may sometimes lead to ambiguity). Relative to a given volume form \"σ\", the isomorphism is given explicitly by\n\nIf, in addition to a volume form, the vector space \"V\" is equipped with an inner product identifying \"V\" with \"V\", then the resulting isomorphism is called the Hodge star operator, which maps an element to its Hodge dual:\n\nThe composition of formula_70 with itself maps and is always a scalar multiple of the identity map. In most applications, the volume form is compatible with the inner product in the sense that it is an exterior product of an orthonormal basis of \"V\". In this case,\nwhere id is the identity mapping, and the inner product has metric signature — \"p\" pluses and \"q\" minuses.\n\nFor \"V\" a finite-dimensional space, an inner product on \"V\" defines an isomorphism of \"V\" with \"V\", and so also an isomorphism of Λ\"V\" with (Λ\"V\"). The pairing between these two spaces also takes the form of an inner product. On decomposable \"k\"-vectors,\nthe determinant of the matrix of inner products. In the special case , the inner product is the square norm of the \"k\"-vector, given by the determinant of the Gramian matrix . This is then extended bilinearly (or sesquilinearly in the complex case) to a non-degenerate inner product on Λ\"V\". If \"e\", , form an orthonormal basis of \"V\", then the vectors of the form\nconstitute an orthonormal basis for Λ(\"V\").\n\nWith respect to the inner product, exterior multiplication and the interior product are mutually adjoint. Specifically, for , , and ,\nwhere is the linear functional defined by\nfor all . This property completely characterizes the inner product on the exterior algebra.\n\nIndeed, more generally for , , and , iteration of the above adjoint properties gives\nwhere now is the dual \"l\"-vector defined by\nfor all .\n\nSuppose that \"V\" and \"W\" are a pair of vector spaces and is a linear transformation. Then, by the universal construction, there exists a unique homomorphism of graded algebras\n\nsuch that\n\nIn particular, Λ(\"f\") preserves homogeneous degree. The \"k\"-graded components of Λ(\"f\") are given on decomposable elements by\n\nLet\n\nThe components of the transformation Λ(\"f\") relative to a basis of \"V\" and \"W\" is the matrix of minors of \"f\". In particular, if and \"V\" is of finite dimension \"n\", then Λ(\"f\") is a mapping of a one-dimensional vector space Λ\"V\" to itself, and is therefore given by a scalar: the determinant of \"f\".\n\nIf\n\nis a short exact sequence of vector spaces, then\n\nis an exact sequence of graded vector spaces as is\n\nIn particular, the exterior algebra of a direct sum is isomorphic to the tensor product of the exterior algebras:\n\nThis is a graded isomorphism; i.e.,\n\nSlightly more generally, if\n\nis a short exact sequence of vector spaces then Λ\"(V)\" has a filtration\n\nwith quotients :formula_89. In particular, if \"U\" is 1-dimensional then\n\nis exact, and if \"W\" is 1-dimensional then\n\nis exact.\n\nIf \"K\" is a field of characteristic 0, then the exterior algebra of a vector space \"V\" can be canonically identified with the vector subspace of T(\"V\") consisting of antisymmetric tensors. Recall that the exterior algebra is the quotient of T(\"V\") by the ideal \"I\" generated by .\n\nLet T(\"V\") be the space of homogeneous tensors of degree \"r\". This is spanned by decomposable tensors\n\nThe antisymmetrization (or sometimes the skew-symmetrization) of a decomposable tensor is defined by\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the symmetric group of permutations on the symbols This extends by linearity and homogeneity to an operation, also denoted by Alt, on the full tensor algebra T(\"V\"). The image Alt(T(\"V\")) is the alternating tensor algebra, denoted A(\"V\"). This is a vector subspace of T(\"V\"), and it inherits the structure of a graded vector space from that on T(\"V\"). It carries an associative graded product formula_94 defined by\n\nAlthough this product differs from the tensor product, the kernel of \"Alt\" is precisely the ideal \"I\" (again, assuming that \"K\" has characteristic 0), and there is a canonical isomorphism\n\nSuppose that \"V\" has finite dimension \"n\", and that a basis of \"V\" is given. then any alternating tensor can be written in index notation as\n\nwhere \"t\" is completely antisymmetric in its indices.\n\nThe exterior product of two alternating tensors \"t\" and \"s\" of ranks \"r\" and \"p\" is given by\n\nThe components of this tensor are precisely the skew part of the components of the tensor product , denoted by square brackets on the indices:\n\nThe interior product may also be described in index notation as follows. Let formula_100 be an antisymmetric tensor of rank \"r\". Then, for , \"i\"\"t\" is an alternating tensor of rank , given by\n\nwhere \"n\" is the dimension of \"V\".\n\nIn applications to linear algebra, the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix. For instance, it is well known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix. This suggests that the determinant can be \"defined\" in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors. Likewise, the minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen \"k\" at a time. These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope. So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined in terms of what the transformation does to the top exterior power. The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.\n\nLet formula_102 be an \"n\"-dimensional vector space over field formula_103 with basis formula_104. \n\n\n\nAll results obtained from other definitions of the determinant, trace and adjoint can be obtained from this definition (since these definitions are equivalent). Here are some basic properties related to these new definitions:\n\nformula_143 is the coefficient of formula_144 term in the characteristic polynomial. They also appear in the expressions of formula_145 and formula_146. Leverrier's Algorithm is an economical way of computing formula_143 and formula_148:\n\nIn physics, many quantities are naturally represented by alternating operators. For example, if the motion of a charged particle is described by velocity and acceleration vectors in four-dimensional spacetime, then normalization of the velocity vector requires that the electromagnetic force must be an alternating operator on the velocity. Its six degrees of freedom are identified with the electric and magnetic fields.\n\nThe decomposable \"k\"-vectors have geometric interpretations: the bivector represents the plane spanned by the vectors, \"weighted\" with a number, given by the area of the oriented parallelogram with sides \"u\" and \"v\". Analogously, the 3-vector represents the spanned 3-space weighted by the volume of the oriented parallelepiped with edges \"u\", \"v\", and \"w\".\n\nDecomposable \"k\"-vectors in Λ\"V\" correspond to weighted \"k\"-dimensional linear subspaces of \"V\". In particular, the Grassmannian of \"k\"-dimensional subspaces of \"V\", denoted \"Gr\"(\"V\"), can be naturally identified with an algebraic subvariety of the projective space P(Λ\"V\"). This is called the Plücker embedding.\n\nThe exterior algebra has notable applications in differential geometry, where it is used to define differential forms. A differential form at a point of a differentiable manifold is an alternating multilinear form on the tangent space at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree \"k\" is a linear functional on the \"k\"-th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms. Differential forms play a major role in diverse areas of differential geometry.\n\nIn particular, the exterior derivative gives the exterior algebra of differential forms on a manifold the structure of a differential algebra. The exterior derivative commutes with pullback along smooth mappings between manifolds, and it is therefore a natural differential operator. The exterior algebra of differential forms, equipped with the exterior derivative, is a cochain complex whose cohomology is called the de Rham cohomology of the underlying manifold and plays a vital role in the algebraic topology of differentiable manifolds.\n\nIn representation theory, the exterior algebra is one of the two fundamental Schur functors on the category of vector spaces, the other being the symmetric algebra. Together, these constructions are used to generate the irreducible representations of the general linear group; see fundamental representation.\n\nThe exterior algebra over the complex numbers is the archetypal example of a superalgebra, which plays a fundamental role in physical theories pertaining to fermions and supersymmetry. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a supernumber or Grassmann number. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional superspace: it is just the set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the weak topology, the open sets being the cylinder sets. An -dimensional superspace is just the -fold product of exterior algebras.\n\nLet \"L\" be a Lie algebra over a field \"K\", then it is possible to define the structure of a chain complex on the exterior algebra of \"L\". This is a \"K\"-linear mapping\ndefined on decomposable elements by\nThe Jacobi identity holds if and only if , and so this is a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra \"L\" to be a Lie algebra. Moreover, in that case Λ\"L\" is a chain complex with boundary operator ∂. The homology associated to this complex is the Lie algebra homology.\n\nThe exterior algebra is the main ingredient in the construction of the Koszul complex, a fundamental object in homological algebra.\n\nThe exterior algebra was first introduced by Hermann Grassmann in 1844 under the blanket term of \"Ausdehnungslehre\", or \"Theory of Extension\".\nThis referred more generally to an algebraic (or axiomatic) theory of extended quantities and was one of the early precursors to the modern notion of a vector space. Saint-Venant also published similar ideas of exterior calculus for which he claimed priority over Grassmann.\n\nThe algebra itself was built from a set of rules, or axioms, capturing the formal aspects of Cayley and Sylvester's theory of multivectors. It was thus a \"calculus\", much like the propositional calculus, except focused exclusively on the task of formal reasoning in geometrical terms.\nIn particular, this new development allowed for an \"axiomatic\" characterization of dimension, a property that had previously only been examined from the coordinate point of view.\n\nThe import of this new theory of vectors and multivectors was lost to mid 19th century mathematicians,\nuntil being thoroughly vetted by Giuseppe Peano in 1888. Peano's work also remained somewhat obscure until the turn of the century, when the subject was unified by members of the French geometry school (notably Henri Poincaré, Élie Cartan, and Gaston Darboux) who applied Grassmann's ideas to the calculus of differential forms.\n\nA short while later, Alfred North Whitehead, borrowing from the ideas of Peano and Grassmann, introduced his universal algebra. This then paved the way for the 20th century developments of abstract algebra by placing the axiomatic notion of an algebraic system on a firm logical footing.\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on intuition of Stuart Davidson\nbut the mathematics behind it goes back to Wacław Sierpiński.\n\nLet \"A\" be the set of functions mapping real numbers in the unit interval [0,1] to countable subsets of the same interval. The axiom \"AX\" states:\n\nA theorem of Sierpiński says that under the assumptions of ZFC set theory,\n\"AX\" is equivalent to the negation of the continuum hypothesis (CH). Sierpiński's theorem answered a question of Hugo Steinhaus and was proved long before the independence of CH had been established by\nKurt Gödel and Paul Cohen.\n\nFreiling claims that probabilistic intuition strongly supports this proposition\nwhile others disagree. There are several versions of the axiom, some of which\nare discussed below.\n\nFix a function \"f\" in \"A\". We will consider a thought experiment that involves throwing two darts at the unit interval. We aren't able to physically determine with infinite accuracy the actual values of the numbers \"x\" and \"y\" that are hit. Likewise, the question of whether \"\"y\" is in \"f\"(\"x\")\" cannot actually be physically computed. Nevertheless, if \"f\" really \"is\" a function, then this question is a meaningful one and will have a definite \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\n\nNow wait until after the first dart, \"x\", is thrown and then assess the chances that the second dart \"y\" will be in \"f\"(\"x\"). Since \"x\" is now fixed, \"f\"(\"x\") is a fixed countable set and has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, this event, with \"x\" fixed, has probability zero. Freiling now makes two generalizations:\n\n\nThe axiom \"AX\" is now justified based on the principle that what will predictably happen every time this experiment is performed, should at the very least be possible. Hence there should exist two real numbers \"x\", \"y\" such that \"x\" is not in \"f\"(\"y\") and \"y\" is not in \"f\"(\"x\").\n\nFix formula_1 an infinite cardinal (\"e.g.\" formula_2). Let formula_3 be the statement: \"there is no map formula_4 from sets to sets of size formula_5 for which formula_6 either formula_7 or formula_8.\"\n\nClaim: formula_9.\n\nProof:\n\"Part I\" (formula_10):\n\nSuppose formula_11. Then letting formula_12 a bijection, we have formula_4 formula_14 clearly demonstrates the failure of Freiling's axiom.\n\n\"Part II\" (formula_15):\n\nSuppose that Freiling's axiom fails. Then fix some formula_16 to verify this fact. Define an order relation on formula_17 by formula_18 iff formula_19. This relation is total and every point has formula_5 many predecessors. Define now a strictly increasing chain formula_21 as follows: at each stage choose formula_22. This process can be carried out since for every ordinal formula_23, formula_24 is a union of formula_25 many sets of size formula_25; thus is of size formula_27 and so is a strict subset of formula_17. We also have that this sequence is \"cofinal\" in the order defined, \"i.e.\" every member of formula_17 is formula_30 some formula_31. (For otherwise if formula_32 is not formula_30 some formula_34, then since the order is total formula_35; implying formula_36 has formula_37 many predecessors; a contradiction.) Thus we may well-define a map formula_38 by formula_39.\nSo formula_40 which is union of formula_41 many sets each of size formula_25. Hence formula_43 and we are done.\nNote that formula_44 so we can easily rearrange things to obtain that formula_45 the above-mentioned form of Freiling's axiom.\n\nThe above can be made more precise: formula_46. This shows (together with the fact that the continuum hypothesis is independent of choice) a precise way in which the (generalised) continuum hypothesis is an extension of the axiom of choice.\n\nFreiling's argument is not widely accepted because of the following two problems with it (which Freiling was well aware of and discussed in his paper).\n\n\nUsing the fact that in ZFC, we have formula_47 (see above), it is not hard to see that the \"failure\" of the axiom of symmetry — and thus the success of formula_11 — is equivalent to the following combinatorial principle for graphs:\n\nThus in the context of ZFC, the failure of a Freiling axiom is equivalent to the existence of a specific kind of choice function.\n\n"}
{"id": "51118531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51118531", "title": "Gutmensch", "text": "Gutmensch\n\nUsers of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour. Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, altruistic, but also religious and human goals in life higher than utilitarian ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.\n\nThe term \"Gutmensch\" is also connected to the term political correctness and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in \"a nice way\" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying \"to have a heart of gold\", in generosity or in an extreme form of altruism.\n\nThe term also hints at the possible difference between \"meant well\" and \"well done\". \"Gutmenschen\" have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term \"Gutmensch\" in a negative way evaluate the actions of \"Gutmenschen\" as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary Duden, which included the term in 2000, defines \"Gutmensch\" as \"a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness.\"\n\nAccording to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term \"Gutmensch\" was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the \"generation 1989\", such as Matthias Horx and Klaus Bittermann. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the protests of 1968. These dictionaries were written in the style of \"Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch\" dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the \"Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen\" (dictionary of the \"Gutmensch\"):\n\nSince the mid 1990s, \"Gutmensch\" has been used alongside political correctness in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.\n\nFormer \"Merkur\" publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense. \"Gutmensch\" was considered the \"latest critical chic\" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of neologisms referring to PC and accompanying the appearance of \"Gutmensch\". Some of them can roughly be translated as \"Gutmensch language\", \"bleeding-heart language\", \"attitudinal kitsch\", \"attitudinal language\" or \"chatter jargon\".\n\nIn 2006, the German Journalists Association claimed that the term \"Gutmensch\" had its origins in Nazi Germany. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies. However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the DJV. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between \"Gutmensch\" and Nazi Germany. Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that \"Gutmensch\" had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of Cardinal von Galen, who had openly opposed the Nazi programme of forced euthanasia. According to the DJV, \"Gutmensch\" was derived from the Yiddish expression \"a gutt Mensch\" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was Adolf Hitler, who in his book \"Mein Kampf\" had repeatedly used the prefix \"gut\" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.\n\nAnother widespread opinion on where \"Gutmensch\" originates, is that it was Friedrich Nietzsche who coined it. There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the \"good human\", albeit not as a fixed expression. The Association for the German Language mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the Forbes magazine, in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest metalworker's union, is called a \"Gutmensch\".\n\nA more positive link may be Bertolt Brecht's play \"The Good Person of Szechwan\" () whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.\n\n\"Die Welt\" journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book \"Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics\", published in 1859, he writes about naive \"Gutmenschen\" as follows: \"Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible \"Gutmensch\" will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?\"\n\nIt is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian \"buonismo\", with meanings all referring to the \"Gutmensch\".\n\nOccasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term \"Gutmensch\" sees criticism of racism as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for \"victims\". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.\n\nThe \"friend of foreigners\", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to humanistic approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their \"own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals\" on him (\"jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen\") Sabine Forschner).\n\nNorbert Bolz (TU Berlin), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station Deutschlandfunk on 11 August 2014:\n\nThe term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a \"political correctness\", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.\n\nThe political right use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading \"left\" ideals to \"do-goodism\", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the \"Gutmensch\" are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak reflecting capacity, an unrealistic and high claim or utopian ideas. Michael Klonovsky, for example, chief executive at German news magazine \"Focus\", accused:\n\nPeople who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for humanism, solidarity and social equity. Seeing the counterpart as \"Gutmensch\" took the discussion to a personal (\"argumentum ad hominem\" = \"ad personam\") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.\n\nThe term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, homophobic, anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or sexual violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.\n\nIn political discussions the usage of the term \"Gutmensch\" gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. Stigmatizations of political opponents by using terms like \"pc\" (political correctness) or \"Gutmensch\" moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed taboos. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like \"Gutmensch\" or \"moralizing prig\" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say \"my opinion or the tabooed view\". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. Clemens Knobloch (Universität Siegen) refers to this relationship.\n\nAccording to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the cipher \"pc\" (the term coming up usually because of \"Gutmenschen\") of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the \"terror of \"Gutmenschen\"\". \"Gutmenschen\" thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about \"moralizing prig\", \"racist prig\", \"fascist prig\", \"Auschwitz prig\" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and anti-Semitic comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term \"Gutmensch\" functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word \"Jew\" by the term \"Gutmensch\" in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.\n\n\"Gutmenschen\", then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as Cathars, but for themselves they used the name \"veri christiani\" (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term \"bonhomme\" (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term \"gentleman\" does. On the other hand, it was non other than Karl Marx who used \"bonhomme\" in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about \"Jacque le bonhomme\", which was a disguise for mocking Max Stirner.\n\nGerman author and journalist Harald Martenstein developed his own definition of \"Gutmensch\" after repeatedly having dealt with the term \"shitstorm\" (in German exclusively referring to an internet meme) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using \"Gutmensch\" to describe people who act aggressive and self-righteous when fighting for what they think is the \"good cause\", unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. \"Gutmenschen\", in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence. Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was Die Welt journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning \"Gutmensch\" into an unusable word for those being of sound mind. Ironically, one year earlier, German writer Akif Pirinçci had called Martenstein a \"Gutmensch\" in his polemic \"Deutschland von Sinnen\" (Germany unhinged). At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book \"Die neuen Leiden des alten M.\" (The New Suffering of Old M.): \"As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian.\"\n\nIn 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band Die Toten Hosen, registered the wordmark \"Gutmensch\". Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled \"Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!\". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.\n\nGermany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called \"Unwort des Jahres\" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.\n\n\"Gutmensch\" was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position). In 2011 the jury stated:\nBy using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term \"Wutbürger\" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term \"Gutmensch\" violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.\n\nThe statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks. The choice was influenced by the refugee crisis in 2015. The term \"Gutmensch\" was selected because \"readiness to help others\" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly. The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term \"Gutmensch\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14329", "title": "Historicism", "text": "Historicism\n\nHistoricism is the idea of attributing meaningful significance to space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture. Historicism tends to be hermeneutical because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations. The approach varies from individualist theories of knowledge such as empiricism and rationalism, which neglect the role of traditions.\n\nThe term \"historicism\" (\"Historismus\") was coined by German philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel. Over time it has developed different and somewhat divergent meanings. Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher G. B. Vico (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the dialectic of Georg Hegel (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of Karl Marx, influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of Franz Boas.\n\nHistoricism may be contrasted with reductionist theories—which assumes that all developments can be explained by fundamental principles (such as in economic determinism)—or with theories that posit that historical changes occur as a result of random chance.\n\nThe Austrian-English philosopher Karl Popper condemned historicism along with the determinism and holism which he argued formed its basis. In his \"Poverty of Historicism\", he identified historicism with the opinion that there are \"inexorable laws of historical destiny\", which opinion he warned against. This contrasts with the contextually relative interpretation of historicism for which its proponents argue. Talcott Parsons criticized historicism as a case of idealistic fallacy in \"The Structure of Social Action\" (1937).\n\nPost-structuralism uses the term \"New Historicism\", which has some associations with both anthropology and Hegelianism.\n\nThe theological use of the word denotes the interpretation of biblical prophecy as being related to church history.\n\nHegel viewed the realization of human freedom as the ultimate purpose of history, which could only be achieved through the creation of the perfect state. And this progressive history would only occur through a dialectical process: namely, the tension between the purpose of humankind (freedom), the position that humankind currently finds itself, and mankind's attempt to bend the current world into accord with its nature. However, because humans are often not aware of the goal of both humanity and history, the process of achieving freedom is necessarily one of self-discovery. Hegel also saw the progress toward freedom being conducted by the \"spirit\" (Geist), a seemingly supernatural force that directed all human actions and interactions. Yet Hegel makes clear that the spirit is a mere abstraction, and only comes into existence \"through the activity of finite agents.\" Thus, Hegel's philosophy of history is not necessarily metaphysical, despite the fact that many of Hegel's opponents and interpreters have understood Hegel's philosophy of history as a metaphysical and determinist view of history. For example, Karl Popper in his book \"The Poverty of Historicism\" interpreted Hegel's philosophy of history as metaphysical and deterministic. Popper referred to this \"Hegelian\" philosophy of history as \"Historicism\".\n\nHegel's historicism also suggests that any human society and all human activities such as science, art, or philosophy, are defined by their history. Consequently, their essence can be sought only by understanding said history. The history of any such human endeavor, moreover, not only continues but also reacts against what has gone before; this is the source of Hegel's famous dialectic teaching usually summarized by the slogan \"thesis, antithesis, and synthesis\". (Hegel did not use these terms, although Johann Fichte did.) Hegel's famous aphorism, \"Philosophy is the history of philosophy,\" describes it bluntly.\n\nHegel's position is perhaps best illuminated when contrasted against the atomistic and reductionist opinion of human societies and social activities self-defining on an \"ad hoc\" basis through the sum of dozens of interactions. Yet another contrasting model is the persistent metaphor of a social contract. Hegel considers the relationship between individuals and societies as organic, not atomic: even their social discourse is mediated by language, and language is based on etymology and unique character. It thus preserves the culture of the past in thousands of half-forgotten metaphors. To understand why a person is the way he is, you must examine that person in his society: and to understand that society, you must understand its history, and the forces that influenced it. The \"Zeitgeist\", the \"Spirit of the Age,\" is the concrete embodiment of the most important factors that are acting in human history at any given time. This contrasts with teleological theories of activity, which suppose that the end is the determining factor of activity, as well as those who believe in a tabula rasa, or blank slate, opinion, such that individuals are defined by their interactions.\n\nThese ideas can be interpreted variously. The Right Hegelians, working from Hegel's opinions about the organicism and historically determined nature of human societies, interpreted Hegel's historicism as a justification of the unique destiny of national groups and the importance of stability and institutions. Hegel's conception of human societies as entities greater than the individuals who constitute them influenced nineteenth-century romantic nationalism and its twentieth-century excesses. The Young Hegelians, by contrast, interpreted Hegel's thoughts on societies influenced by social conflict for a doctrine of social progress, and attempted to manipulate these forces to cause various results. Karl Marx's doctrine of \"historical inevitabilities\" and historical materialism is one of the more influential reactions to this part of Hegel's thought. Significantly, Karl Marx's theory of alienation argues that capitalism disrupts traditional relationships between workers and their work.\n\nHegelian historicism is related to his ideas on the means by which human societies progress, specifically the dialectic and his conception of logic as representing the inner essential nature of reality. Hegel attributes the change to the \"modern\" need to interact with the world, whereas ancient philosophers were self-contained, and medieval philosophers were monks. In his History of Philosophy Hegel writes:\nIn modern times things are very different; now we no longer see philosophic individuals who constitute a class by themselves. With the present day all difference has disappeared; philosophers are not monks, for we find them generally in connection with the world, participating with others in some common work or calling. They live, not independently, but in the relation of citizens, or they occupy public offices and take part in the life of the state. Certainly they may be private persons, but if so, their position as such does not in any way isolate them from their other relationship. They are involved in present conditions, in the world and its work and progress. Thus their philosophy is only by the way, a sort of luxury and superfluity. This difference is really to be found in the manner in which outward conditions have taken shape after the building up of the inward world of religion. In modern times, namely, on account of the reconciliation of the worldly principle with itself, the external world is at rest, is brought into order — worldly relationships, conditions, modes of life, have become constituted and organized in a manner which is conformable to nature and rational. We see a universal, comprehensible connection, and with that individuality likewise attains another character and nature, for it is no longer the plastic individuality of the ancients. This connection is of such power that every individuality is under its dominion, and yet at the same time can construct for itself an inward world.\nThis opinion that entanglement in society creates an indissoluble bond with expression, would become an influential question in philosophy, namely, the requirements for individuality. It would be considered by Nietzsche, John Dewey and Michel Foucault directly, as well as in the work of numerous artists and authors. There have been various responses to Hegel's challenge. The Romantic period emphasized the ability of individual genius to transcend time and place, and use the materials from their heritage to fashion works which were beyond determination. The modern would advance versions of John Locke's infinite malleability of the human animal. Post-structuralism would argue that since history is not present, but only the image of history, that while an individual era or power structure might emphasize a particular history, that the contradictions within the story would hinder the very purposes that the history was constructed to advance.\n\nIn the context of anthropology and other sciences which study the past, historicism has a different meaning. Anthropological historicism is associated with the work of Franz Boas. His theory used the diffusionist concept that there were a few \"cradles of civilization\" which grew outwards, and merged it with the idea that societies would adapt to their circumstances, which is called historical particularism. The school of historicism grew in response to unilinear theories that social development represented adaptive fitness, and therefore existed on a continuum. While these theories were espoused by Charles Darwin and many of his students, their application as applied in social Darwinism and general evolution characterized in the theories of Herbert Spencer and Leslie White, historicism was neither anti-selection, nor anti-evolution, as Darwin never attempted nor offered an explanation for cultural evolution. However, it attacked the notion that there was one normative spectrum of development, instead emphasizing how local conditions would create adaptations to the local environment. Julian Steward refuted the viability of globally and universally applicable adaptive standards proposing that culture was honed adaptively in response to the idiosyncrasies of the local environment, the cultural ecology, by specific evolution. What was adaptive for one region might not be so for another. This conclusion has likewise been adopted by modern forms of biological evolutionary theory.\n\nThe primary method of historicism was empirical, namely that there were so many requisite inputs into a society or event, that only by emphasizing the data available could a theory of the source be determined. In this opinion, grand theories are unprovable, and instead intensive field work would determine the most likely explanation and history of a culture, and hence it is named \"historicism.\"\n\nThis opinion would produce a wide range of definition of what, exactly, constituted culture and history, but in each case the only means of explaining it was in terms of the historical particulars of the culture itself.\n\nSince the 1950s, when Jacques Lacan and Foucault argued that each epoch has its own knowledge system, within which individuals are inexorably entangled, many post-structuralists have used \"historicism\" to describe the opinion that all questions must be settled within the cultural and social context in which they are raised. Answers cannot be found by appeal to an external truth, but only within the confines of the norms and forms that phrase the question. This version of historicism holds that there are only the raw texts, markings and artifacts that exist in the present, and the conventions used to decode them. This school of thought is sometimes given the name of \"New Historicism\".\n\nThe same term, \"new historicism\" is also used for a school of literary scholarship which interprets a poem, drama, etc. as an expression of or reaction to the power-structures of its society. Stephen Greenblatt is an example of this school.\n\nWithin the context of 20th-century philosophy, debates continue as to whether ahistorical and immanent methods were sufficient to understand meaning—that is to say, \"what you see is what you get\" positivism—or whether context, background and culture are important beyond the mere need to decode words, phrases and references. While post-structural historicism is relativist in its orientation, that is, it sees each culture as its own frame of reference, a large number of thinkers have embraced the need for historical context, not because culture is self-referential, but because there is no more compressed means of conveying all of the relevant information except through history. This opinion is often seen as deriving from the work of Benedetto Croce. Recent historians using this tradition include Thomas Kuhn.\n\nIn Christianity, the term \"historicism\" refers to the confessional Protestant form of prophetical interpretation which holds that the fulfillment of biblical prophecy has occurred throughout history and continues to occur; as opposed to other methods which limit the time-frame of prophecy-fulfillment to the past or to the future.\n\nThere is also a particular opinion in ecclesiastical history and in the history of dogmas which has been described as historicist by Pope Pius XII in the encyclical \"Humani generis\". \"They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various forms in which revealed truth has been clothed, forms that have succeeded one another in accordance with the different teachings and opinions that have arisen over the course of the centuries.\"\n\nThe social theory of Karl Marx, with respect to modern scholarship, has an ambiguous relation to historicism. Critics of Marx have charged his theory with historicism since its very genesis. However, the issue of historicism also finds itself important to many debates within Marxism itself; the charge of historicism has been made against various types of Marxism, typically disparaged by Marxists as \"vulgar\" Marxism.\n\nMarx himself expresses critical concerns with this historicist tendency in his Theses on Feuerbach:\n\nKarl Popper used the term \"historicism\" in his influential books \"The Poverty of Historicism\" and \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", to mean: \"an approach to the social sciences which assumes that \"historical prediction\" is their primary aim, and which assumes that this aim is attainable by discovering the 'rhythms' or the 'patterns', the 'laws' or the 'trends' that underlie the evolution of history\". Karl Popper wrote with reference to Hegel's theory of history, which he criticized extensively. However, there is wide dispute whether Popper's description of \"historicism\" is an accurate description of Hegel, or more his characterisation of his own philosophical antagonists, including Marxist-Leninist thought, then widely held as posing a challenge to the philosophical basis of the West, as well as theories such as Spengler's which drew predictions about the future course of events from the past.\n\nIn \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", Popper attacks \"historicism\" and its proponents, among whom (as well as Hegel) he identifies and singles out Plato and Marx—calling them all \"enemies of the open society\". The objection he makes is that historicist positions, by claiming that there is an inevitable and deterministic pattern to history, abrogate the democratic responsibility of each one of us to make our own free contributions to the evolution of society, and hence lead to totalitarianism.\n\nAnother of his targets is what he terms \"moral historicism\", the attempt to infer moral values from the course of history; in Hegel's words, that \"history is the world's court of justice\". This may take the form of conservatism (former might is right), positivism (might is right) or futurism (presumed coming might is right). As against these, Popper says that he does not believe \"that success proves anything or that history is our judge\". Futurism must be distinguished from prophecies that the right will prevail: these attempt to infer history from ethics, rather than ethics from history, and are therefore historicism in the normal sense rather than moral historicism.\n\nHe also attacks what he calls \"Historism\", which he regards as distinct from historicism. By historism, he means the tendency to regard every argument or idea as completely accounted for by its historical context, as opposed to assessing it by its merits. In Popperian terms, the \"New Historicism\" is an example of historism rather than of historicism proper.\n\nLeo Strauss used the term \"historicism\" and reportedly termed it the single greatest threat to intellectual freedom insofar as it denies any attempt to address injustice-pure-and-simple (such is the significance of historicism's rejection of \"natural right\" or \"right by nature\"). Strauss argued that historicism \"rejects political philosophy\" (insofar as this stands or falls by questions of permanent, trans-historical significance) and is based on the belief that \"all human thought, including scientific thought, rests on premises which cannot be validated by human reason and which came from historical epoch to historical epoch.\" Strauss further identified R. G. Collingwood as the most coherent advocate of historicism in the English language. Countering Collingwood's arguments, Strauss warned against historicist social scientists' failure to address real-life problems—most notably that of tyranny—to the extent that they relativize (or \"subjectivize\") all ethical problems by placing their significance strictly in function of particular or ever-changing socio-material conditions devoid of inherent or \"objective\" \"value.\" Similarly, Strauss criticized Eric Voegelin's abandonment of ancient political thought as guide or vehicle in interpreting modern political problems.\n\nIn his books, \"Natural Right and History\" and \"On Tyranny\", Strauss offers a complete critique of historicism as it emerges in the works of Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. Many believe that Strauss also found historicism in Edmund Burke, Tocqueville, Augustine, and John Stuart Mill. Although it is largely disputed whether Strauss himself was a historicist, he often indicated that historicism grew out of and against Christianity and was a threat to civic participation, belief in human agency, religious pluralism, and, most controversially, an accurate understanding of the classical philosophers and religious prophets themselves. Throughout his work, he warns that historicism, and the understanding of progress that results from it, expose us to tyranny, totalitarianism, and democratic extremism. In his exchange with Alexandre Kojève in \"On Tyranny\", Strauss seems to blame historicism for Nazism and Communism. In a collection of his works by Kenneth Hart entitled \"Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity\", he argues that Islam, traditional Judaism, and ancient Greece, share a concern for sacred law that makes them especially susceptible to historicism, and therefore to tyranny. Strauss makes use of Nietzsche's own critique of progress and historicism, although Strauss refers to Nietzsche himself (no less than to Heidegger) as a \"radical historicist\" who articulated a philosophical (if only untenable) justification for historicism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23880464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23880464", "title": "Honour thy father and thy mother", "text": "Honour thy father and thy mother\n\n\"Honour thy father and thy mother\" is one of the Ten Commandments in the Hebrew Bible. The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in Deuteronomy (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics count this as the fourth.\n\nThese commandments were enforced as law in many jurisdictions, and are still considered enforceable law by some. Exodus 20, 1 describes the Ten Commandments as being spoken by God, inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God, broken by Moses, and rewritten on replacement stones by the Lord.\n\nIn the Torah, keeping this commandment was associated with individual benefit and with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. Dishonouring parents by striking or cursing them was punishable by death and so the clause \"so that you may live long\" could be interpreted as \"so that you are not put to death\". In the Talmud, the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God. According to the prophet Malachi, God makes the analogy himself:\nThe commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for human owes his existence to his father and his mother.\n\nThe Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God. It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated:\nBecause honouring parents is part of honouring God, the mitzvah does not depend on the worthiness of the parent:\"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father.\" (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25)\n\nIt also requires honour to one's stepparents or an older sibling who is raising one, and one's teachers, though one has a greater obligation to honor a parent than a grandparent.\n\nThe commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.\n\nKeeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. According to the Torah, striking or cursing one’s father or mother was punishable by immediate death. In Deuteronomy, a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.\n\nHonouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God. According to the prophet Jeremiah, God refers to himself as Father to Israel, and according to the prophet Isaiah, God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters. According to the prophet Malachi, God calls for similar honour.\n\nAccording to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of Rechab for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods: \n\nAccording to the Mishneh Torah this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.\n\nWhile Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents:\nThe commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey. Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a law of the Torah, s/he must refuse to obey.\n\nA child is not required to obey if a parent says that s/he must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person s/he wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.\n\nA child who is travelling has an obligation to communicate with his/her parents to let them know s/he is safe in order to prevent them from worrying.\n\nA child must continue to honour his/her parent after their deaths. This can be done by reciting kaddish for 11 months and on the yarzeit (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child.\n\nA child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent. A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother. A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1–9, Matthew 19:17–19, Mark 10:17–19, Luke 18:18–21) Paul quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in Ephesus:\nIn his letters to the Romans and Timothy, Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29–31, 2 Timothy 3:2).\n\nThe words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.\n\nAccording to the gospel of Matthew, the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: \"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.\" (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does \"not\" include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.\n\nPaul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following:\n\nThe import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role:\nAccording to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity – first God, then parents, then others. Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society. The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society:\nThe Gospel of Luke notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching. \"Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'\" (Proverbs 6:20–22)\n\nThe Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing \"material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress\". This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure.\n\nThe principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers. The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as \"a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'.\" Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father.\n\nFather Seraphim Stephens sees \"Honor\" defined as \"Love and Respect\", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. \"It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people.\" Richard D. Andrews points out that, \"Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents.\"\n\nJohn Calvin describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion \"absurd\".\n\nThe commentary of John Wesley on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents. Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, \"Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?\" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.\n\nMatthew Henry explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of Esther honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai:\n\nThe commandment itself encourages obedience \"so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you\". Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual.\n\nIn his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death. Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate. Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.\n\nAlthough Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose. As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother, and Paul specified that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, “which is pleasing to God.”\n\nJust as \"honor\" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance. \n\nRespect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.\n\nThis commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: \"...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.\" Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: \"...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.\"\nAs with most terms of the covenant between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25879157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25879157", "title": "Individual", "text": "Individual\n\nAn individual is that which exists as a distinct entity. Individuality (or selfhood) is the state or quality of being an individual; particularly of being a person separate from other people and possessing his or her own needs or goals, rights and responsibilities. The exact definition of an individual is important in the fields of biology, law, and philosophy.\n\nFrom the 15th century and earlier (and also today within the fields of statistics and metaphysics) \"individual\" meant \"indivisible\", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning \"a person\". From the 17th century on, \"individual\" indicates separateness, as in individualism.\n\nAlthough individuality and individualism are commonly considered to mature with age/time and experience/wealth, a sane adult human being is usually considered by the state as an \"individual person\" in law, even if the person denies individual culpability (\"I followed instructions\"). An individual person is accountable for their actions/decisions/instructions, subject to prosecution in both national and international law, from the time that they have reached age of majority, often though not always more or less coinciding with the granting of voting rights, tax and military duties/ individual right to bear arms (protected only under certain constitutions). In line with hierarchy, ultimate individual human reward for success and responsibility for failure is nonetheless found at the top of human society.\n\nin International law:\n\nin American law:\n\nThe \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law\" states: A \"natural person\" is \"A human being as distinguished from person (as a corporation) created by operation of law. A 1910 legal dictionary states: \"Individual: As a noun, this term denotes a single person as distinguished from a group or class, and also, very commonly, a private or natural person as distinguished from a partnership, corporation, or association.\"\n\nIn Buddhism, the concept of the individual lies in anatman, or \"no-self.\" According to anatman, the individual is really a series of interconnected processes that, working together, give the appearance of being a single, separated whole. In this way, anatman, together with anicca, resembles a kind of bundle theory. Instead of an atomic, indivisible self distinct from reality, the individual in Buddhism is understood as an interrelated part of an ever-changing, impermanent universe (see Interdependence, Nondualism, Reciprocity).\n\nEarly empiricists such as Ibn Tufail in early 12th century Islamic Spain, and John Locke in late 17th century England, introduced the idea of the individual as a tabula rasa (\"blank slate\"), shaped from birth by experience and education. This ties into the idea of the liberty and rights of the individual, society as a social contract between rational individuals, and the beginnings of individualism as a doctrine.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel regarded history as the gradual evolution of Mind as it tests its own concepts against the external world. Each time the mind applies its concepts to the world, the concept is revealed to be only partly true, within a certain context; thus the mind continually revises these incomplete concepts so as to reflect a fuller reality (commonly known as the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). The individual comes to rise above his or her own particular viewpoint, and grasps that he or she is a part of a greater whole insofar as he or she is bound to family, a social context, and/or a political order.\n\nWith the rise of existentialism, Søren Kierkegaard rejected Hegel's notion of the individual as subordinated to the forces of history. Instead, he elevated the individual's subjectivity and capacity to choose his or her own fate. Later Existentialists built upon this notion. Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, examines the individual's need to define his/her own self and circumstances in his concept of the will to power and the heroic ideal of the Übermensch. The individual is also central to Sartre's philosophy, which emphasizes individual authenticity, responsibility, and free will. In both Sartre and Nietzsche (and in Nikolai Berdyaev), the individual is called upon to create his or her own values, rather than rely on external, socially imposed codes of morality.\n\nAyn Rand's Objectivism regards every human as an independent, sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his or her own life, a right derived from his or her nature as a rational being. Individualism and Objectivism hold that a civilized society, or any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among humans, can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights — and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its members. The principle of individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. Since only an individual man or woman can possess rights, the expression \"individual rights\" is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of clarification in today's intellectual chaos), but the expression \"collective rights\" is a contradiction in terms. Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual).\n\nIn biology, the question of the individual is related to the definition of an organism, which is an important question in biology and philosophy of biology, despite there having been little work devoted explicitly to this question. An individual organism is not the only kind of individual that is considered as a \"unit of selection\". Genes, genomes, or groups may function as individual units.\n\nAsexual reproduction occurs in some colonial organisms so that the individuals are genetically identical. Such a colony is called a genet, and an individual in such a population is referred to as a ramet. The colony, rather than the individual, functions as a unit of selection. In other colonial organisms the individuals may be closely related to one another but differ as a result of sexual reproduction.\n\n"}

The term was coined by Bruce Donald, Pat Xavier, John Canny, and John Reif. Donald et al. developed the first polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) for the problem. By providing a provably polynomial-time ε-approximation algorithm, they resolved a long-standing open problem in optimal control. Their first paper considered time-optimal control (\"fastest path\") of a point mass under Newtonian dynamics, amidst polygonal (2D) or polyhedral (3D) obstacles, subject to state bounds on position, velocity, and acceleration. Later they extended the technique to many other cases, for example, to 3D open-chain kinematic robots under full Lagrangian dynamics. More recently, many practical heuristic algorithms based on stochastic optimization and iterative sampling were developed, by a wide range of authors, to address the kinodynamic planning problem. These techniques for kinodynamic planning have been shown to work well in practice. However, none of these heuristic techniques can guarantee the optimality of the computed solution (i.e., they have no performance guarantees), and none can be mathematically proven to be faster than the original PTAS algorithms (i.e., none have a provably lower computational complexity).\n"}

If a topological space is endowed with a Kuranishi structure, then locally it can be identified with the zero set of a smooth map formula_1, or the quotient of such a zero set by a finite group. Kuranishi structure was introduced by Japanese mathematicians Kenji Fukaya and Kaoru Ono in the study of Gromov–Witten invariants in symplectic geometry and named after Masatake Kuranishi.\n\nLet formula_2 be a compact metrizable topological space. Let formula_3 be a point. A Kuranishi neighborhood of formula_4 (of dimension formula_5) is a 5-tuple\n\nwhere\n\n\nThey should satisfy that formula_12.\n\nIf formula_13 and formula_6, formula_15 are their Kuranishi neighborhoods respectively, then a coordinate change from formula_16 to formula_17 is a triple\n\nwhere\n\n\nIn addition, they must satisfy the compatibility condition:\n\n\nA Kuranishi structure on formula_2 of dimension formula_5 is a collection\n\nwhere\n\n\nIn addition, the coordinate changes must satisfy the cocycle condition, namely, whenever formula_34, we require that\n\nover the regions where both sides are defined.\n\nIn Gromov–Witten theory, one needs to define integration over the moduli space of stable maps formula_36. They are maps formula_37 from a nodal Riemann surface with genus formula_38 and formula_39 marked points into a symplectic manifold formula_2, such that each component satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation\n\nIf the moduli space is a smooth, compact, oriented manifold or orbifold, then the integration (or a fundamental class) can be defined. When the symplectic manifold formula_2 is semi-positive, this is indeed the case (except for codimension 2 boundaries of the moduli space) if the almost complex structure formula_43 is perturbed generically. However, when formula_2 is not semi-positive, the moduli space may contain configurations for which one component is a multiple cover of a holomorphic sphere formula_45 whose intersection with the first Chern class of formula_2 is negative. Such configurations make the moduli space very singular so a fundamental class cannot be defined in the usual way.\n\nThe notion of Kuranishi structure was a way of defining a virtual fundamental cycle, which plays the same role as a fundamental cycle when the moduli space is cut out transversely. It was first used by Fukaya and Ono in defining the Gromov–Witten invariants and Floer homology, and was further developed when Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, Ono studied the Lagrangian intersection Floer theory.\n"}

This is in contrast to production-based indicators, which just look at resource use within a country. For example, cows will require land to graze on within a country, but may also be fed by feed grown on land in another country.

It found that a switch to a healthier diet, with less meat and with reduced stimulants, could lead to no net land imports, while a switch to vegetarian or vegan diets would lead to Germany being a net exporter of land.\n\nSustainable Europe Research Institute have also examined potential scenarios for reducing Europe's land footprint, including dietary changes.\n\nThe EU's 7th Environmental action plan calls for examination of land (and other) footprints:\n\nThe European Parliament's own initiative report on \"Resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy\", which was voted on 9 July 2015, includes the following text calling for action from the European Commission on land and other footprints:\n\nA study of the four resource footprint indicators, carried for the European Commission examined what data was available to measure the land footprint, carbon footprint, water footprint & material footprint at economy level. This study concluded that Land Footprint needed methodological improvement and harmonisation, and that a common, international, multi-regional input output database would make it easier to calculate all four footprints.\n\nFriends of the Earth Europe, together with a wider Land Footprint Coalition, has been advocating for Land Footprint to be used to measure resource consumption, as part of a wider project that argues that four footprints - land, water, carbon & material (equivalent to either RMC or TMC, see Material Flow Accounting) - are an effective way of measuring & managing Europe's resource use. The coalition, which includes Slow Food Europe and Birdlife, are also calling for Europe to reduce its land footprint.\n\n"}

It was later modified for sociology by Robert K. Merton. Merton appeared interested in sharpening the conceptual tools to be employed in a functional analysis. \n\nManifest functions are conscious, deliberate and beneficial, the latent ones the unconscious, unintended and beneficial, and dysfunctions are unconscious, unintended and harmful. While functions are intended (manifest) or unintended (latent), and have a positive effect on society, dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized (latent) and have a negative effect on society.\n\nManifest functions are the consequences that people observe or expect. It is explicitly stated and understood by the participants in the relevant action. The manifest function of a rain dance, used as an example by Merton in his 1967 \" Social Theory and Social Structure\", is to produce rain, and this outcome is intended and desired by people participating in the ritual.\n\nLatent functions are those that are neither recognized nor intended. A latent function of a behavior is not explicitly stated, recognized, or intended by the people involved. Thus, they are identified observers. In the example of rain ceremony, the latent function reinforces the group identity by providing a regular opportunity for the members of a group to meet and engage in a common activity.\n\nPeter L. Berger describes a series of examples illustrating the differences between manifest functions and latent dysfunctions:\nWhile Talcott Parsons tends to emphasize the manifest functions of social behavior, Merton sees attention to latent functions as increasing the understanding of society: the distinction between manifest and latent forces the sociologist to go beyond the reasons individuals give for their actions or for the existence of customs and institutions; it makes them look for other social consequences that allow these practices’ survival and illuminate the way society works.\n\nDysfunctions can also be manifest or latent. While functions are intended or recognized (manifest), and may have a positive effect on society, dysfunctions are unintended or unrecognized, and have a negative effect on society.\n\nManifest dysfunctions are anticipated disruptions of social life. For example, a manifest dysfunction of a festival might include disruptions of transportation and excessive production of garbage. Latent dysfunctions are unintended and unanticipated disruptions of order and stability. In the festival example, they would be represented by people missing work due to the traffic jam.\n\nBroadly stated and here relying on the systems model first developed in medical science, an interrelated bundle of social structures (e.g., Zulu culture), treated as a social system, involves the parts (structural elements) acting in such a fashion so as to help maintain the homeodynamic equilibrium of the system of which they are an element. Manifest functions are the obvious and intended consequences a structural feature displays in the maintenance of the steady state of the system of which it is a part. Latent functions are less obvious or unintended consequences. Both manifest and latent functions contribute to the social system’s unchanging ongoingness or stasis. In this very specific sense both may be interpreted as useful and positive.\n\nIn conducting a functional analysis, dysfunctions are consequences of structural elements that produce changes in their environing social system. The flame of the candle system flickers. The structural cause would be labeled dysfunctional. The candle’s steady state has been disturbed or changed. The concept affords the only relief to structural-functionalism’s inherent conservative bias. Dysfunction signifies the mechanism by which social change is evidenced within a social system. Whether that change is manifest or latent is a relatively simple empirical question. Whether that change is good or bad would seem to require interpretative criteria not afforded by a social scientific paradigm for functional analysis.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21708", "title": "Non-standard analysis", "text": "Non-standard analysis\n\nThe history of calculus is fraught with philosophical debates about the meaning and logical validity of fluxions or infinitesimal numbers. The standard way to resolve these debates is to define the operations of calculus using epsilon–delta procedures rather than infinitesimals. Non-standard analysis instead reformulates the calculus using a logically rigorous notion of infinitesimal numbers.\n\nNon-standard analysis was originated in the early 1960s by the mathematician Abraham Robinson. He wrote:\n\n[...] the idea of infinitely small or \"infinitesimal\" quantities seems to appeal naturally to our intuition. At any rate, the use of infinitesimals was widespread during the formative stages of the Differential and Integral Calculus. As for the objection [...] that the distance between two distinct real numbers cannot be infinitely small, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that the theory of infinitesimals implies the introduction of ideal numbers which might be infinitely small or infinitely large compared with the real numbers but which were \"to possess the same properties as the latter\"\n\nRobinson argued that this law of continuity of Leibniz's is a precursor of the transfer principle. Robinson continued:\n\nHowever, neither he nor his disciples and successors were able to give a rational development leading up to a system of this sort. As a result, the theory of infinitesimals gradually fell into disrepute and was replaced eventually by the classical theory of limits.\n\nRobinson continues:\n\nIt is shown in this book that Leibniz's ideas can be fully vindicated and that they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical Analysis and to many other branches of mathematics. The key to our method is provided by the detailed analysis of the relation between mathematical languages and mathematical structures which lies at the bottom of contemporary model theory.\n\nIn 1973, intuitionist Arend Heyting praised non-standard analysis as \"a standard model of important mathematical research\".\n\nA non-zero element of an ordered field formula_1 is infinitesimal if and only if its absolute value is smaller than any element of formula_1 of the form formula_3, for formula_4 a standard natural number. Ordered fields that have infinitesimal elements are also called non-Archimedean. More generally, non-standard analysis is any form of mathematics that relies on non-standard models and the transfer principle. A field which satisfies the transfer principle for real numbers is a hyperreal field, and non-standard real analysis uses these fields as \"non-standard models\" of the real numbers.\n\nRobinson's original approach was based on these non-standard models of the field of real numbers. His classic foundational book on the subject \"Non-standard Analysis\" was published in 1966 and is still in print. On page 88, Robinson writes:\n\nThe existence of non-standard models of arithmetic was discovered by Thoralf Skolem (1934). Skolem's method foreshadows the ultrapower construction [...]\n\nSeveral technical issues must be addressed to develop a calculus of infinitesimals. For example, it is not enough to construct an ordered field with infinitesimals. See the article on hyperreal numbers for a discussion of some of the relevant ideas.\n\nIn this section we outline one of the simplest approaches to defining a hyperreal field formula_5. Let formula_6 be the field of real numbers, and let formula_7 be the semiring of natural numbers. Denote by formula_8 the set of sequences of real numbers. A field formula_5 is defined as a suitable quotient of formula_10, as follows. Take a nonprincipal ultrafilter formula_11. In particular, formula_12 contains the Fréchet filter. Consider a pair of sequences\n\nWe say that formula_14 and formula_15 are equivalent if they coincide on a set of indices which is a member of the ultrafilter, or in formulas:\n\nThe quotient of formula_10 by the resulting equivalence relation is a hyperreal field formula_5, a situation summarized by the formula formula_19.\n\nThere are at least three reasons to consider non-standard analysis: historical, pedagogical, and technical.\n\nMuch of the earliest development of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibniz was formulated using expressions such as \"infinitesimal number\" and \"vanishing quantity\". As noted in the article on hyperreal numbers, these formulations were widely criticized by George Berkeley and others. It was a challenge to develop a consistent theory of analysis using infinitesimals and the first person to do this in a satisfactory way was Abraham Robinson.\n\nIn 1958 Curt Schmieden and Detlef Laugwitz published an Article \"Eine Erweiterung der Infinitesimalrechnung\" - \"An Extension of Infinitesimal Calculus\", which proposed a construction of a ring containing infinitesimals. The ring was constructed from sequences of real numbers. Two sequences were considered equivalent if they differed only in a finite number of elements. Arithmetic operations were defined elementwise. However, the ring constructed in this way contains zero divisors and thus cannot be a field.\n\nH. Jerome Keisler, David Tall, and other educators maintain that the use of infinitesimals is more intuitive and more easily grasped by students than the \"epsilon-delta\" approach to analytic concepts. This approach can sometimes provide easier proofs of results than the corresponding epsilon-delta formulation of the proof. Much of the simplification comes from applying very easy rules of nonstandard arithmetic, as follows:\n\ntogether with the transfer principle mentioned below.\n\nAnother pedagogical application of non-standard analysis is Edward Nelson's treatment of the theory of stochastic processes.\n\nSome recent work has been done in analysis using concepts from non-standard analysis, particularly in investigating limiting processes of statistics and mathematical physics. Sergio Albeverio et al. discuss some of these applications.\n\nThere are two very different approaches to non-standard analysis: the semantic or model-theoretic approach and the syntactic approach. Both these approaches apply to other areas of mathematics beyond analysis, including number theory, algebra and topology.\n\nRobinson's original formulation of non-standard analysis falls into the category of the \"semantic approach\". As developed by him in his papers, it is based on studying models (in particular saturated models) of a theory. Since Robinson's work first appeared, a simpler semantic approach (due to Elias Zakon) has been developed using purely set-theoretic objects called superstructures. In this approach \"a model of a theory\" is replaced by an object called a \"superstructure\" over a set . Starting from a superstructure one constructs another object using the ultrapower construction together with a mapping that satisfies the transfer principle. The map * relates formal properties of and . Moreover, it is possible to consider a simpler form of saturation called countable saturation. This simplified approach is also more suitable for use by mathematicians who are not specialists in model theory or logic.\n\nThe \"syntactic approach\" requires much less logic and model theory to understand and use. This approach was developed in the mid-1970s by the mathematician Edward Nelson. Nelson introduced an entirely axiomatic formulation of non-standard analysis that he called Internal Set Theory (IST). IST is an extension of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) in that alongside the basic binary membership relation ∈, it introduces a new unary predicate \"standard\", which can be applied to elements of the mathematical universe together with some axioms for reasoning with this new predicate.\n\nSyntactic non-standard analysis requires a great deal of care in applying the principle of set formation (formally known as the axiom of comprehension), which mathematicians usually take for granted. As Nelson points out, a fallacy in reasoning in IST is that of \"illegal set formation\". For instance, there is no set in IST whose elements are precisely the standard integers (here \"standard\" is understood in the sense of the new predicate). To avoid illegal set formation, one must only use predicates of ZFC to define subsets.\n\nAnother example of the syntactic approach is the Alternative Set Theory introduced by Vopěnka, trying to find set-theory axioms more compatible with the non-standard analysis than the axioms of ZF.\n\nAbraham Robinson's book \"Non-standard analysis\" was published in 1966. Some of the topics developed in the book were already present in his 1961 article by the same title (Robinson 1961). In addition to containing the first full treatment of non-standard analysis, the book contains a detailed historical section where Robinson challenges some of the received opinions on the history of mathematics based on the pre–non-standard analysis perception of infinitesimals as inconsistent entities. Thus, Robinson challenges the idea that Augustin-Louis Cauchy's \"sum theorem\" in Cours d'Analyse concerning the convergence of a series of continuous functions was incorrect, and proposes an infinitesimal-based interpretation of its hypothesis that results in a correct theorem.\n\nAbraham Robinson and Allen Bernstein used non-standard analysis to prove that every polynomially compact linear operator on a Hilbert space has an invariant subspace.\n\nGiven an operator on Hilbert space , consider the orbit of a point in under the iterates of . Applying Gram-Schmidt one obtains an orthonormal basis for . Let be the corresponding nested sequence of \"coordinate\" subspaces of . The matrix expressing with respect to is almost upper triangular, in the sense that the coefficients are the only nonzero sub-diagonal coefficients. Bernstein and Robinson show that if is polynomially compact, then there is a hyperfinite index such that the matrix coefficient is infinitesimal. Next, consider the subspace of . If in has finite norm, then is infinitely close to .\n\nNow let be the operator formula_20 acting on , where is the orthogonal projection to . Denote by the polynomial such that is compact. The subspace is internal of hyperfinite dimension. By transferring upper triangularisation of operators of finite-dimensional complex vector space, there is an internal orthonormal Hilbert space basis for where runs from to , such that each of the corresponding -dimensional subspaces is -invariant. Denote by the projection to the subspace . For a nonzero vector of finite norm in , one can assume that is nonzero, or to fix ideas. Since is a compact operator, is infinitely close to and therefore one has also . Now let be the greatest index such that formula_21. Then the space of all standard elements infinitely close to is the desired invariant subspace.\n\nUpon reading a preprint of the Bernstein-Robinson paper, Paul Halmos reinterpreted their proof using standard techniques. Both papers appeared back-to-back in the same issue of the \"Pacific Journal of Mathematics\". Some of the ideas used in Halmos' proof reappeared many years later in Halmos' own work on quasi-triangular operators.\n\nOther results were received along the line of reinterpreting or reproving previously known results. Of particular interest is Kamae's proof of the individual ergodic theorem or van den Dries and Wilkie's treatment of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth. Nonstandard analysis was used by Larry Manevitz and Shmuel Weinberger to prove a result in algebraic topology.\n\nThe real contributions of non-standard analysis lie however in the concepts and theorems that utilizes the new extended language of non-standard set theory. Among the list of new applications in mathematics there are new approaches to probability \nhydrodynamics, measure theory, nonsmooth and harmonic analysis, etc.\n\nThere are also applications of non-standard analysis to the theory of stochastic processes, particularly constructions of Brownian motion as random walks. Albeverio et-al have an excellent introduction to this area of research.\n\nAs an application to mathematical education, H. Jerome Keisler wrote \"\". Covering non-standard calculus, it develops differential and integral calculus using the hyperreal numbers, which include infinitesimal elements. These applications of non-standard analysis depend on the existence of the \"standard part\" of a finite hyperreal . The standard part of , denoted , is a standard real number infinitely close to . One of the visualization devices Keisler uses is that of an imaginary infinite-magnification microscope to distinguish points infinitely close together. Keisler's book is now out of print, but is freely available from his website; see references below.\n\nDespite the elegance and appeal of some aspects of non-standard analysis, criticisms have been voiced, as well, such as those by E. Bishop, A. Connes, and P. Halmos, as documented at criticism of non-standard analysis.\n\nGiven any set , the \"superstructure\" over a set is the set defined by the conditions\n\nThus the superstructure over is obtained by starting from and iterating the operation of adjoining the power set of and taking the union of the resulting sequence. The superstructure over the real numbers includes a wealth of mathematical structures: For instance, it contains isomorphic copies of all separable metric spaces and metrizable topological vector spaces. Virtually all of mathematics that interests an analyst goes on within .\n\nThe working view of nonstandard analysis is a set and a mapping which satisfies some additional properties. To formulate these principles we first state some definitions.\n\nA formula has \"bounded quantification\" if and only if the only quantifiers which occur in the formula have range restricted over sets, that is are all of the form:\n\nFor example, the formula\n\nhas bounded quantification, the universally quantified variable ranges over , the existentially quantified variable ranges over the powerset of . On the other hand,\n\ndoes not have bounded quantification because the quantification of \"y\" is unrestricted.\n\nA set \"x\" is \"internal\" if and only if \"x\" is an element of *\"A\" for some element \"A\" of . *\"A\" itself is internal if \"A\" belongs to .\n\nWe now formulate the basic logical framework of nonstandard analysis:\n\n\nOne can show using ultraproducts that such a map * exists. Elements of are called \"standard\". Elements of are called hyperreal numbers.\n\nThe symbol denotes the nonstandard natural numbers. By the extension principle, this is a superset of . The set is nonempty. To see this, apply countable saturation to the sequence of internal sets\n\nThe sequence has a nonempty intersection, proving the result.\n\nWe begin with some definitions: Hyperreals \"r\", \"s\" are \"infinitely close\" if and only if\n\nA hyperreal is \"infinitesimal\" if and only if it is infinitely close to 0. For example, if is a hyperinteger, i.e. an element of , then is an infinitesimal. A hyperreal is \"limited\" (or \"finite\") if and only if its absolute value is dominated by (less than) a standard integer. The limited hyperreals form a subring of containing the reals. In this ring, the infinitesimal hyperreals are an ideal.\n\nThe set of limited hyperreals or the set of infinitesimal hyperreals are \"external\" subsets of ; what this means in practice is that bounded quantification, where the bound is an internal set, never ranges over these sets.\n\nExample: The plane with and ranging over is internal, and is a model of plane Euclidean geometry. The plane with and restricted to limited values (analogous to the Dehn plane) is external, and in this limited plane the parallel postulate is violated. For example, any line passing through the point on the -axis and having infinitesimal slope is parallel to the -axis.\n\nTheorem. For any limited hyperreal there is a unique standard real denoted infinitely close to . The mapping is a ring homomorphism from the ring of limited hyperreals to .\n\nThe mapping st is also external.\n\nOne way of thinking of the standard part of a hyperreal, is in terms of Dedekind cuts; any limited hyperreal defines a cut by considering the pair of sets where is the set of standard rationals less than and is the set of standard rationals greater than . The real number corresponding to can be seen to satisfy the condition of being the standard part of .\n\nOne intuitive characterization of continuity is as follows:\n\nTheorem. A real-valued function on the interval is continuous if and only if for every hyperreal in the interval , we have: .\n\n(see microcontinuity for more details). Similarly,\n\nTheorem. A real-valued function is differentiable at the real value if and only if for every infinitesimal hyperreal number , the value\n"}

It consolidated provisions in the law related to offences against the person (an expression which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. It was part of the criminal law reforms known collectively as \"Peel's Acts\", passed with the objective of simplifying the law. Among the laws it replaced was clause XXXVI of the Magna Carta, the first time any part of the Magna Carta was repealed, and the Buggery Act 1533. It also abolished the crime of petty treason.\n\nThe Act only applied to England and Wales (then described as England). A similar statute was passed for Ireland the following year (10 Geo. 4 c. 34).\n\nA number of the Act's provisions were repealed and replaced by the Offences against the Person Act 1837. The death penalty for shooting, stabbing, cutting or wounding with intent (s.12), and for post-quickening abortions (s.13) under this Act was abolished by repeal of those sections by section 1 of the 1837 Act (sections 12 and 13 of this act were replaced by sections 4 and 6 of the 1837 Act, respectively).\n\nThe death penalty for rape (s.16) and carnal knowledge of a girl under ten (s.17) was abolished by amendment of those sections by section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841. Section 18 made provision in relation to proof of carnal knowledge.\n\nThe Act was wholly replaced by the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n\nUnder the Offences Against the Person Act of 1828, several sections pertained to the crime of rape. The penalty for being convicted of rape was still death, and remained so until 1841. The Act also made it a felony punishable by death to carnally know a girl under the age of ten. Carnally knowing a girl over the age of ten and under the age of twelve was a misdemeanor punishable with imprisonment with the option of hard labor for a term to be determined by the court. \n\nThe Act also affirmed that proof of penetration was sufficient to reach the conclusion that one person had had carnal knowledge of another; before the 1828 statute, victims of rape had to prove that the perpetrator ejaculated. Historian Anna Clark has argued that medical experts used ejaculation as proof of rape because it was tangible evidence that reduced the need for a victim's testimony. Clark also contends that requiring proof of ejaculation allowed judges and magistrates to ask victims humiliating and explicit questions. By changing the definition of carnal knowledge from ejaculation to proof of penetration, the 1828 act made it a little easier for victims to prosecute their rapists. Records show that from 1828 to 1841, 63 defendants accused of rape were tried at the Old Bailey. Of those 63 defendants, 16 were found guilty and 12 were sentenced to death. Three had their sentenced reduced to imprisonment, and one had his judgment respited altogether.\n\nThe Act and its focus on interpersonal violence also had the effect of increasing formal accusations of domestic violence, by reducing the stigma surrounding such activity and diminishing judicial delays.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37509351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37509351", "title": "Polarization (economics)", "text": "Polarization (economics)\n\nEconomists refer to the polarization of the labor force when middle-class jobs—requiring a moderate level of skills, like autoworkers’ jobs—seem to disappear relative to those at the bottom, requiring few skills, and those at the top, requiring greater skill levels. The structure of job opportunities in the United States has sharply polarized over the past two decades, with expanding job opportunities in both high-skill, high-wage occupations and low-skill, low wage occupations, coupled with contracting opportunities in middle-wage, middle-skill white-collar and blue-collar jobs. Although this has contributed to the rise of income inequality in the U.S. it is a minor factor compared to the relatively rapid rise in income and wealth by the top 1%. Although income and wealth inequality are uniquely American phenomena. of the past decades in industrialized countries, employment and economic polarization is widespread across industrialized economies; it is not a uniquely American phenomenon. Over the past decades, wage gains were also polarized, with modest gains at the extremes and smaller gains in the middle. A good description of polarization in Great Britain is one of the first uses of the term, economic polarization.\n\nAlthough \"polarization\" is a relatively young concept in economic analysis, the phenomenon of wage and labor skill polarization is as old as economics. More recently economic polarization has been connected to both automation and the export of jobs to low wage countries. Many middle-skilled jobs are routine and demand only average skills and abilities. As a result, current computer technologies are able to handle them, or, alternatively, they can be outsourced electronically to foreign websites to be performed by comparatively low-wage workers.\n\nBecause polarization appears similar in 16 European countries as well as the U.S. it seems likely that similar forces affect these shared economic developments. Loss of American manufacturing jobs to overseas global competitors has removed many middle skill jobs. Structural changes with more investment in robotics has removed other middle skill jobs globally, but not the lowest skill or the highest skill. As computers become more competent, this may change. Changes in education in the Third World, with increased education levels in the rest of the world compared to levels in industrial nations, has affected highly industrial economies. Unionization has mixed effects on polarization, since it tends to raise wages at all levels, but reduces the differences between managerial and other employees. The decline in unionization in America may increase polarization slightly. Globalization also lowers wages across the board.The most powerful causes are the redistributive effects of government, through laws such as those that discourage unionization, determine corporate governance, and limit the extent of monopoly rents. These laws generally are plutocratic and accrue benefit to those at the top, at the expense of those in the middle, driving many of the latter into the bottom. As an example of how polarization is affected by labor demand, rather than skill distributions, changing patterns of employment and earnings show strong correlations between wages and the proportion of a skill group employed. When fewer are employed, the wages go down rather than up as simple supply and demand would predict. Another factor is the levelling off of the supply of college graduates after the 1970s in the US and the consequent increase in the wage gap between college graduates and high school graduates. Whether this is also occurring in other industrial countries is not so clear.\n\nOne way of quantifying the polarization of the economy is to compare the fraction of those with incomes that are close to the middle—for example, a range that goes from 50 percent greater than the median to 50 percent less than the median—has fallen since 1970 from just over 50 percent to just over 42 percent. Similarly, the U.S. and the E.U. have shown almost identical trends in the share of employment rise by the high and low skill jobs, and a loss by the middle skill jobs, between 1993 and 2006. Polarization became an issue during the 2012 United States presidential election when Joe Biden asserted that the previous policies had \"eviscerated\" and \"buried\" the middle class. This picked up on Stiglitz' statement: \"But in recent years, America’s middle class has become eviscerated...\"\n\nJob polarization has also changed the nature of business cycle recoveries. Prior to polarization, employment would recover quickly following recessions because employment in routine jobs would bounce back. Since the 1980s, job polarization has led to the permanent loss of routine jobs, especially during recessions. Following the recessions of the 1990s and 2000s, employment would not recover because routine jobs are not coming back. This has led to jobless recoveries.\n"}

It was developed in the early 1980s by researchers at Purdue University and is currently managed by Mark Gibney of the University of North Carolina at Asheville.\n\nThe Political Terror Scale is a yearly measure of terror inflicted upon a population. \"Terror\" is defined as state terror, or violations of physical and personal integrity rights carried out by the state or its agents. Examples of political terror include extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and political imprisonment.\n\nOriginally, only 59 countries were coded for within the database between 1976 and 1983. In 1984, Mark Gibney took over as manager of the database and expanded the list of countries coded to 180 and the range of years to the most recent years available (currently 2012).The Political Terror Scale uses three sources to code each country: The State Department's \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,\" the \"Annual Report\" from Amnesty International and most recently the \"World Report\" from Human Rights Watch.The database can be viewed and downloaded from its website.\n\nThe Political Terror Scale is a five-point fixed scale.\n\n\nThe scale is based on the assessment of violence along three dimensions:scope, intensity, and range. Scope is the type of violence carried out by the state, Intensity refers to the frequency at which the state employs a given type of violence, and Range is the portion of the population targeted for abuse (can also be thought of as the selectivity of violence).\n\nThe principle researchers consist of professors from several universities.\n\nCoding is also supplemented by undergraduate and graduate students from several universities. Research assistants for the 2012-2013 year are: Daniel Arnon, Gray Barrett, Minori Hinds, and Kelsey Tavares of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, Alexander Liffiton and Rachel Olson of Arizona State University, Max Scott of the London School of Economics, and Shea Streeter, a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe data for each country is analyzed by at least two senior coders and undergraduate assistants. Each nation receives two scores - one from the State Department's report and one from Amnesty International's report. Coders agree with each other regarding a country's score at a rate of roughly 85%. If coders cannot come to an agreement than a third coder will settle the dispute. Due to the contextual nature of the source data, coding is highly subjective, and coders are instructed to ignore their own personal biases or knowledge when determining a country's score. Coders are also instructed to give countries the benefit of any doubt when scoring. If a coder cannot decided between two numbers, they are instructed to use the lower number when scoring.\n\nThe Political Terror Scale only measures acts of political terror inflicted by the state. Due to this fact, it may be difficult to score countries when it is not immediately clear which groups are committing acts of violence. Colombia is a perfect example of this dilemma, as although overall violence has decreased since 2000, violence from local militias and paramilitary groups has continued at a relatively stable rate. Although the government has attempted to mitigate the violence, certain actors within the government have either allowed the violence to continue or contributed to it in some way. Therefore, Colombia's score reflects the close level of involvement between government and private actors.\n\nAnother challenge is that the Political Terror Scale only measures actual violations of physical or integrity rights or acts of violence and therefore countries ruled by truly repressive and coercive regimes may receive low scores. Nations who are successful at oppressing their citizens or who have committed acts of violence in the past to deter resistance generally do not have to commit many acts of violence in order to maintain control. For example, the former USSR would score low on the Political Terror Scale and that score would not reflect the overall level of oppression present in that society.\n\n"}

{"id": "14892710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14892710", "title": "Product type", "text": "Product type\n\nIn programming languages and type theory, a product of \"types\" is another, compounded, type in a structure. The \"operands\" of the product are types, and the structure of a product type is determined by the fixed order of the operands in the product. An instance of a product type retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its primitive data types. The expression of an instance of a product type will be a tuple, and is called a \"tuple type\" of expression. A product of types is a direct product of two or more types.\n\nIf there are only two component types, it can be called a \"pair type\". For example, if two component types A and B are the set of all possible values that type, the product type written A × B contains elements that are pairs (a,b), where \"a\" and \"b\" are instances of A and B respectively. The pair type is a special case of the dependent pair type, where the type B may depend on the instance picked from A.\n\nIn many languages, product types take the form of a record type, for which the components of a tuple can be accessed by label. In languages that have algebraic data types, as in most functional programming languages, algebraic data types with one constructor are isomorphic to a product type.\n\nIn the Curry-Howard correspondence, product types are associated with logical conjunction (AND) in logic.\n\nThe notion directly extends to the product of an arbitrary finite number of types (a n-ary product type), and in this case, it characterizes the expressions which behave as tuples of expressions of the corresponding types. A degenerated form of product type is the unit type: it is the product of no types.\n\nIn call-by-value programming languages, a product type can be interpreted as a set of pairs whose first component is a value in the first type and whose second component is a value in the second type. In short, it is a cartesian product and it corresponds to a product in the category of types.\n\nMost functional programming languages have a primitive notion of product type. For instance, the product of \"type\", ..., \"type\" is written \"type\"codice_1...codice_1\"type\" in ML and codice_3\"type\"codice_4...codice_4\"type\"codice_6 in Haskell. In both these languages, tuples are written codice_3\"v\"codice_4...codice_4\"v\"codice_6 and the components of a tuple are extracted by pattern-matching. Additionally, many functional programming languages provide more general algebraic data types, which extend both product and sum types. Product types are the dual of sum types.\n\nAn example of a product type is the type of a vector in a vector space or an algebra over a field: the type is a product of a number type, and a direction type. Thus, for example, the brochure for the International System of Units starts out in section 1.1 saying \"The value of a quantity is generally expressed as the product of a number and a unit\", and also presents the unit product of a Newton and a meter with the product notation of mathematics: Newton meter (N m or N · m). This is properly indicative of the vector space nature of SI units over the abelian group of dimensions under multiplication, and the field of real numbers -- the SI units form an algebra over a field.\n\n\n"}

These are known as the triple gems (or jewels) of Jainism and hence also known as \"Ratnatr\nThe very first \"sloka\" (aphorism) of the Sacred Jain text, Tattvartha sutra reads:\n\nĀcārya Pujyapada writes in \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" (translated by Prof. S.A. Jain):\n\nAcharya Umaswami has written in \"Tattvārthasūtra\" that Tattvarthasraddhanam Samyak-darshanam (1-2), which means \"Belief in substances ascertained as they are is right faith.\"\n\nThese seven substances also called \"tattva\" are:-\n\nMany disciplines of knowledge are developed based on certain fundamental givens, or axioms. For example, Euclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems (\"true statements given the axioms\") are derived from a finite number of axioms. Special theory of relativity bases itself on one of the fundamental principles called \"The Principle of Invariant Light Speed\". It takes it as given that light in vacuum propagates with the constant speed in terms of any system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source. These seven fundamental concepts, provide the metaphysical structure of Jain philosophy.\n\nIn the human state of existence, right faith acquired from destruction as well as from destruction-cum- subsidence. An intelligent conviction and profound faith in the essential nature of the soul, of matter, and of their mutual relationships, actions and reactions, is a necessary condition for launching upon the path of liberation. Jainism declares that a person with the right faith will have spiritual calmness (\"Prasanna\"), desire for liberation from the endless birth-life-death cycles (\"Samvega\"), without any attachment or aversion to anything (\"Nirveda\"), kindness (\"Anukampa\"), and belief in the \"tattvas\" (fundamental principles) described just above (\"āstika\").\n\nJain texts mention that knowledge is of five kinds – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy, and omniscience. Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge. Most of our knowledge is sensory-based (\"mati\") and based on recorded knowledge developed by our ancestors in the form of books, articles, papers and other medium (\"sruta\"). Jain philosophers also include knowledge acquired directly without any medium. This is achieved by removing the karmic veil on the soul.\n\n\nRight conduct is the application of the knowledge developed, so as to exercise control over our inner desires and reach a stage where there is no attachment or aversion.\n\nRight conduct includes:\n\n\nThe interesting aspect is that on this path there is a place for every one from the beginner to the most advanced seekers. Further, it encompasses all aspects of human life, namely social, personal, economic and spiritual leading to integrated development of the individual.\n\nRight view and right knowledge are inter-dependent. For instance, when the clouds disappear, both the heat and the light of the sun are manifested simultaneously. Similarly, when right faith is attained by the soul owing to the subsidence, destruction or destruction- cum-subsidence of faith-deluding karmas, right sensory knowledge and right scriptural knowledge are attained by the soul\nat the same time by the removal of wrong sensory and wrong scriptural knowledge.\n\nRight Knowledge must be accompanied by Right conduct which is necessary for the destruction of karmic bonds. Without it there is no release from the cycle of transmigration, i.e., repeated births and deaths. Just like the light from millions of lamps is of no avail to a blind person, studying scriptures alone is of no use to a person who does not apply them.\n\nJainism acknowledges that the soul advances to its liberated stage in various steps, called \"Gunasthana\". Jain literature describes these states in detail. The following provides a concise summary on the various statuses of soul on its journey to spiritual advancement.\n\n\n5. The soul now begins to observe some of the rules of right conduct with a view to perfecting itself. With the discipline of introductory or minor vows, the soul starts on the process of climbing the spiritual ladder.\n6. Major vows taken up with firm resolve to control passions. There may be failures due to lack of full control over passions or carelessness.\n\n7. Intense practice of vows assisted in better self-control and virtually replaced carelessness with spiritual vigilance and vigor.\n8. Closer to perfect self-control over actions, higher control over mind, thought and passions with the soul ready for reduction of the effects of conduct-deluding karma.\n9. Higher control over removal of passions, and elimination of conduct-deluding karma begins.\n10. Complete elimination of all passions except for subtle degree of attachment.\n\n11. Suppressed passions and lingering conduct-deluding karma may rise to drag the soul to lower stages; fleeting experiences of equanimity.\n12. This is the point of no return. All passions as well as conduct-deluding karma are eliminated. Permanent internal peace achieved. No new bondage from this point onwards.\n13. All inimical karma destroyed. Omniscience achieved and Arihant stage reached. However the perfected soul is still trapped in the physical body (with right knowledge attained).\n14. This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the \"aghātiā karmas\". Those who pass this stage are called \"siddha\" and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.\n\n\n"}

However, it is speculated that the scriptwriters may have borrowed the idea from the 1865 Lewis Carroll's novel \"Alice in Wonderland\", in which the central character has a choice to drink or eat potions to enable her adventure to continue. In the Matrix, the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader Morpheus. The red pill represented an uncertain future—it would free him from the enslaving control of the machine-generated dream world and allow him to escape into the real world, but living the \"truth of reality\" is harsher and more difficult. On the other hand, the blue pill represented a beautiful prison—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the simulated reality of the Matrix.\n\nOn December 1, 1969 the Selective Service System of the United States conducted two lotteries to determine the order of call to military service in the Vietnam War for men born from January 1, 1944 to December 31, 1950. The 366 days of the year (including February 29) were printed on slips of paper. These pieces of paper were then each placed in opaque blue plastic capsules that resembled large blue pills. The blue pills were then mixed in a shoebox and then dumped into a deep glass jar. The blue pills were then drawn from the jar one at a time and opened. The order that each birthdate was drawn signified the draft order for that birthdate. From this first draft lottery, 195 birth dates were selected to serve in Vietnam.\n\nDouglas Hofstadter's book \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" features a pair of characters who \"push-into\" and \"pop-out of\" the two-dimensional world of Escher prints. The way they do this is to drink from a blue or a red phial. A further reference could be taken later in the story when the pair encounter a paradox during which \"The System crashed\". Hofstadter cites Lewis Carroll as a strong influence on the book (the front cover of the book has a line that says that the book is \"in the spirit of Lewis Carroll\".) The \"push-into\" and \"pop-out of\" phials are reminiscent of the \"Alice in Wonderland\" \"drink me\" and \"eat me\" potion and cake, which cause Alice to shrink and grow.\n\nThe science fiction film \"Total Recall\" (1990) features a red pill which is offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Douglas Quaid, by one Dr. Edgemar. He is told \"it's a symbol, of your desire to return to reality.\" No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words \"inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.\" Quaid seriously considers the offer but notices that Dr. Edgemar is sweating, whereupon he shoots him in the forehead. The implication is that if the dream is not a dream but reality, Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid, and the pill is simply poison. He had also told Quaid that if Quaid killed him, \"the walls of reality will come crashing down\"; moments after his death, the walls of the hotel room literally come crashing down.\n\n\"The Matrix\" (1999), directed by The Wachowskis, makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including gnosticism, existentialism, and nihilism. The film's premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Zhuangzi's \"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly\", René Descartes's skepticism and evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the \"Ding an sich\", Robert Nozick's \"experience machine\", the concept of a simulated reality and the brain in a vat thought experiment. \"The Matrix\" very clearly references \"Alice in Wonderland\" with the \"white rabbit\" and the \"down the rabbit hole\" phrases, as well as referring to the Matrix as \"Wonderland\".\n\nJapanese director Mamoru Oshii's \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a strong influence.\n\nIn \"The Matrix\", Neo (Keanu Reeves) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named Morpheus. Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), introduces Neo to Morpheus.\n\nMorpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:\n\nAs narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a \"location device\" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be \"unplugged\" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.\n\nNeo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and bioelectricity consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Lana Wachowski said:\nIn \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", when Ben Stiller's character lands at Nuuk in Greenland, he asks the man in the airport booth: \"Do you have any cars available?\" \"Yeah, we have a blue one and a red one\", the man replies. \"I'll take the red one\", says Walter. \"The choice between the red and blue car at the rental car lot is worthy of mention, if only because it almost candidly pulls the idea from the red pill of \"The Matrix\". Two jelly bean, or pill, shaped cars , red and blue; the only thing missing is Lawrence Fishburne working the counter\". \"The passage connecting reality to illusion is often visualised using tangible things and physical environments [as] Neo took the red pill in \"The Matrix\".\"\n\nAn essay written by Russell Blackford discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first \"Matrix\" film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to \"shove the red pill right up [his] ass.\" When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, \"Ignorance is bliss.\" Blackford argues that the \"Matrix\" films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer James Patrick Kelly feel that \"The Matrix\" stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.\n\n\"Matrix Warrior: Being the One\" author Jake Horsley compared the red pill to LSD, citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as addictive, calling \"The Matrix\" series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.\n\nIn the book \"The Art of the Start\", author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51393701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51393701", "title": "Revisionist school of Islamic studies", "text": "Revisionist school of Islamic studies\n\nThe Revisionist school of Islamic studies, (also Historical-Critical school of Islamic studies) is a movement within Islamic studies which started in the 1970s and initiated a paradigm shift in Islamic Studies.\n\nThe core concern of the Revisionist School is to finally show consequence concerning the knowledge, practically available since Ignác Goldziher's time, that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's early times - written 150 to 200 years after Muhammad - are highly questionable as historical sources. This relates to Muhammad's biography, the formation history of the Quran, and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the Umayyad Caliphate. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed by applying the historical-critical method.\n\nThe designation \"Revisionism\" was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a dismissive undertone. Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword. Today, also the adherents of the new movement use \"Revisionism\" to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.\n\nThe new movement originated at the SOAS, University of London by two publications of John Wansbrough: \"Quranic Studies\" (1977) and \"The Sectarian Milieu\" (1978). Among the students of Wansbrough are: Andrew Rippin, Norman Calder, G. R. Hawting, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook. With their work \"Hagarism\" (1977) Patricia Crone and Michael Cook set a milestone in Islamic Studies, since by provocative theses they provided maximal attention in the academic community. Later, both distanced themselves from their too far reaching theses in \"Hagarism\". Yet they adhered to the basically new academic approach. Martin Hinds, too, studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. Robert G. Hoyland is a student of Patricia Crone.\n\nA second local focus of the new movement is at the Saarland University in Saarbrücken, Germany (). Since the 1970s there is a focus on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran, by Günter Lüling und Gerd-Rüdiger Puin. Also in Saarbrücken, Karl-Heinz Ohlig developed in the 2000s together with Volker Popp, Christoph Luxenberg and Markus Groß a theory of Islam's earliest times which has no need for Muhammad as a historical person.\n\nFurther representatives are: Hans Jansen from the Netherlands who in 2005/7 published a work showing in detail why the known accounts of Muhammad's life are legends only. Yehuda D. Nevo published in 2003 his work \"Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State\" in which he denies the historicity of Muhammad. James A. Bellamy is known for his textual criticism of the Quran and for his proposals of emendations, i.e. proposals to correct the traditional text of the Quran. Fred Donner published in 2010 the first well-founded hypothesis on the early time of Islam without excessive exaggerations which found public attention.\n\nTom Holland studied history and became a renowned author of popular science publications on ancient history. With his work \"In the Shadow of the Sword\" (2012) Tom Holland contributed heavily to the popularization of the new research results. Tom Holland depicts a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches, thus having like Fred Donner provided a well-founded hypothesis of Islam's early times which avoids exaggerations.\n\nSven Kalisch is a German Islamic theologian who rejected teaching Islamic theology without considering the new results of historical-critical research. Thereupon the German Islamic associations withdrew his allowance to teach future Islamic theologians and teachers. Later Kalisch left Islam. Today he is teaching the history of ideas in the Near East in Late Antiquity in Münster.\n\nThe arguments against the credibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were e.g. summarized by Prof. Hans Jansen in his work \"De Historische Mohammed\". Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by Ibn Ishaq resp. Ibn Hisham which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions, contradictions to other historical sources, embellishments by later authors, politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction, symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names, literary construction of the depiction according e.g. to biblical models, and chronological and calendrical incredibilities.\n\nSome examples:\n\n\nJansen points out that the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation of the Quran. The Quran mostly does not reveal the situation for which a revelation was made. The historical context is merely indicated, at best. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since.\n\nIn her work \"Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam\" Patricia Crone gave a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This examination is much cited in literature yet discusses only a few aspects of Muhammad's biography meant to be exemplary for the nature of all the Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Patricia Crone writes: \"\"\"These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there \"was\" an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities.\"\"\n\nStarting point for all researchers is the awareness that the traditional Islamic accounts about Islam's beginnings which came into being only 150 to 200 years after Muhammad are highly questionable as historical sources. The true events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline:\n\n\nThe consequent historical-critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book \"Hagarism\" (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications.\nCriticism is expressed by researchers like Tilman Nagel, who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method. \nA certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to \"revisionism\" alone but to \"extreme revisionism\" or \"ultra-revisionism\".\n\nGregor Schoeler discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: \"To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'.\"\n\nResistance comes partly from older academics who still live in their thoughts in the world of the Islamic legends. As Thomas S. Kuhn in his famous work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962) described, a new paradigm prevails in academia often not by convincing current academics but by convincing the next generation of academics.\n\nContinuous resistance against the new paradigm comes from researchers who fundamentally reject the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. They argue that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too. Adherents of Revisionism doubt whether this still is a scientific point of view.\n\nThe relationship between religion and science had always been shaped by conflicts... It is always a hurting process for every religion to realize that parts of its teachings were wrong: at the beginning, new scientific results are often considered to be an attack on religion itself; only later is it realized that religion can live with the new findings, so long as the religion's core is not affected, and things are sorted out in the way of religious reforms.\n\nBy nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.\n\nThe gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad. According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles):\n\nBesides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:\n\nIbn Warraq, an author known for his criticism of Islam, has complied several revisionist essays in his book, \"The Quest for the Historical Muhammad.\" Fred Donner, reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough school of revisionism, the author presents a \"one-sided selection\" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The results is \"a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader.\" Robert Spencer, in this book \"Did Muhammad Exist? An Inquiry Into Islam's Obscure Origins,\" advances the thesis that Islam was a state-religion created by the Abbasids to justify the empire.\n\n\n\n"}

Most notable is Anuraj Gambhir who is attributed with the creation and popularisation of this term through various presentations and conferences around the world.\n\nOne of the first formally published instances of the word was in the journal 'Childhood Education' (1924), in the article it appears to be used to discuss education and psychology related issues.\n\nJack Cohen and Ian Stewart authors of the book \"The Collapse of Chaos\" (1995), a non-fiction book that attempts to explain chaos theory and complex systems to the general public.\n\nThe complexity of algorithms and of mathematical problems is one of the central subjects of theoretical computer science. Simplexity was whimsically defined by computer scientists Broder and Stolfi as a concept worthy of as much attention as complexity:\n\n\"The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P . An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-cast inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P\"\n\nThe concept of Simplexity was amplified in the mid 1970s by Bruce Schiff (self-described theorist) and restated as \"The process by which nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. The result of a simple random act can only be predicted by complicated means. The spatial placement of each atom in a transplanted plant root ball is difficult to predict, but, the plant will adapt its root ball to the hole, and continue to thrive. This conceptual expression harkens back to original statements of Newton, \"Nature is pleased with simplicity\", Dalton, \"rule of greatest simplicity,\" and Einstein, \"Nature is the realization of the simplest conceivable mathematical ideas.\"\n\nIn 1974 Rustum Roy and Olaf Müller noted simplexity in the structure of ternary compounds:\n\nIn 2003, simplexity has been defined by Philippe Compain in the context of an article on the future of synthetic chemistry as follows:\n\n\"Simplexity may be defined as the combination of simplicity and complexity within the context of a dynamic relationship between means and ends.\";\n\nThe quest for simplicity constitutes indeed the basis for all future challenges of chemical synthesis including diversity, selectivity and green chemistry. Due to the almost infinity of molecules that could in theory be synthesized, the focus of synthetic research has been shifted gradually from target-oriented synthesis to diversity-oriented synthesis (divergent synthesis). A scientific approach based on the power of the molecular construction game and guided by an ideal for simplicity, has a high potential for discovery. The creative combination of synthetic methodologies, mixing simplicity and maximization of structural complexity, is indeed expected to be a powerful tool to produce unprecedented molecular structures with beneficial properties for mankind.\n\nSimplexity became the topic of formal discussion at the Hamburg Trend Day in Germany. Among the formal contributors were Peter Wippermann, Dr. Norbert Bolz, David Bosshart, Designer Ora Ito, Markus Shepherd, Susane Tide Frater.\n\n\"Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple)\" by Jeffrey Kluger details many ways in which simplexity theory can be applied to multiple disciplines. Kluger offers a look at simplexity at work in economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine, and dozens of human behaviors. \"Simplexity\" also provides insight into how readers can improve their lives by understanding the interplay of complexity and simplicity.\n\nSimplexity has been used by Jens Nordvig to describe the particular aim of his analytics firm Exante Data.\"Maybe the best word for what we are trying to achieve is \"simplexity\". A research product that draws on a very complex analytical foundation, but is presented in a very simple and easy to digest manner. ... This concept of \"simplexity\" may be important in a much broader sense. The general idea of simplexity could be key to effectively service a growing community of so-called “quantmental” fund managers that use large amounts of data and modeling in their processes, while still applying a human touch in the final investment decisions. We think \"simplexity\" will be increasingly important to how we develop our overall research at Exante.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Wipperman proposed a social definition \"We long for simplicity and satisfaction. Simplexity therefore stands for a balance between the growing complexity of daily life and our own personal satisfaction. In order to attain this state, we have to stop always striving to make optimal decisions. In the future, it will be more important to make judgments that are just good enough.\"\n\n\nDan Geesin first used the term 'Simplexity' in his essay 'The melancholy of the set square', 2002, when describing how technology creates more distance through complex interfaces whilst performing a simple task. For example, getting money from a bank machine. He describes how in between the chain of interfaces there is more room for error. More interfaces, more potential problems.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind.\n\nThe principal constituents of Soft Computing (SC) are Fuzzy Logic (FL), Evolutionary Computation (EC), Machine Learning (ML) and Probabilistic Reasoning (PR), with the latter subsuming belief networks and parts of learning theory.\n\nSoft Computing became a formal area of study in Computer Science in the early 1990s. Earlier computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple systems. More complex systems arising in biology, medicine, the humanities, management sciences, and similar fields often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and analytical methods. However, it should be pointed out that complexity of systems is relative and that many conventional mathematical models have been very productive in spite of their complexity.\n\nSoft computing deals with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve computability, robustness and low solution cost. As such it forms the basis of a considerable amount of machine learning techniques. Recent trends tend to involve evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algorithms and bio-inspired computation.\n\nComponents of soft computing include:\n\nGenerally speaking, soft computing techniques resemble biological processes more closely than traditional techniques, which are largely based on formal logical systems, such as sentential logic and predicate logic, or rely heavily on computer-aided numerical analysis (as in finite element analysis). Soft computing techniques are intended to complement each other.\n\nUnlike hard computing schemes, which strive for exactness and full truth, soft computing techniques exploit the given tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, and uncertainty for a particular problem. Another common contrast comes from the observation that inductive reasoning plays a larger role in soft computing than in hard computing.\n\n"}

Entering the stream (\"sotāpatti\") is the first of the four stages of enlightenment.\n\nThe first moment of the attainment is termed the path of stream-entry (\"sotāpatti-magga\"), which cuts through the first three fetters. The person who experiences it is called a stream-winner (\"sotāpanna\").\n\nThe sotāpanna is said to attain an intuitive grasp of the dharma, this wisdom being called right view (\"sammā diṭṭhi\") and has unshakable confidence in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha, sometimes taken to be the triple refuge, are at other times listed as being objects of recollection. In general though, confirmed confidence in the \"Buddha\"', \"Dharma\" and \"Sangha\", respectively, is considered to be one of the four limbs of stream-winning (\"sotāpannassa angāni\"). The sotapanna is said to have \"opened the eye of the Dhamma\" (\"dhammacakka\"), because they have realized that whatever arises will cease (impermanence). Their conviction in the true dharma would be unshakable.\n\nThey have had their first glimpse of the unconditioned element, the \"asankhata\", in which they see the goal, in the moment of the fruition of their path (magga-phala). Whereas the stream-entrant has seen nibbāna and, thus has verified confidence in it, the arahant can drink fully of its waters, so to speak, to use a simile from the Kosambi Sutta (SN 12.68) — of a \"well\", encountered along a desert road.\n\nHowever, the remaining three paths, namely: once-return (sakadāgāmin), non-return (anāgāmin), and sainthood (arahatta) become 'destined' (\"sammatta niyāma\") for the stream-entrant. Their enlightenment as a disciple (\"ariya-sāvaka\") becomes inevitable within seven lives transmigrating among gods and humans; if they are diligent (\"appamatta\", \"appamāda\") in the practice of the Teacher's (\"satthāra\") message, they may fully awaken within their present life. They have very little future suffering to undergo.\n\nThe early Buddhist texts (e.g. the Ratana Sutta) say that a stream-entrant will no longer be born in the animal womb, or hell realms; nor as a hungry ghost. The pathways to unfortunate rebirth destinations (\"duggati\") have been closed to them.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the qualities of a sotāpanna are described as:\nThe three fetters which the sotāpanna eradicates are:\n\nAccording to the Pali Commentary, six types of defilement would be eventually abandoned by a sotāpanna, and no major transgressions:\n\nA sotāpanna will be safe from falling into the states of misery (they will not be born as an animal, ghost, or hell being). Their lust, hatred and delusion will not be strong enough to cause rebirth in the lower realms. A sotāpanna will have to be reborn at most only seven more times in the human or heavenly worlds before attaining nibbāna. It is not necessary for a sotāpanna to be reborn seven more times before attaining nibbāna, as an ardent practitioner may progress to the higher stages in the same life in which he/she reaches the Sotāpanna level by making an aspiration and persistent effort to reach the final goal of nibbāna.\n\nAccording to Buddha, there are three types of sotapannas classifiable according to their possible rebirths:\n(1) \"If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters (personality-belief, skeptical doubt, attachment to rules and rituals;(samyojana), has entered the stream (to Nibbāna), he is no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is firmly established, destined to full enlightenment. After having passed amongst the heavenly and human beings only seven times more through the round of rebirths, he puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one with 7 births at the utmost' (sattakkhattu-parama).\n(2) \"If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having passed among noble families two or three times through the round of rebirths, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one passing from one noble family to another' (kolankola).\n(3) \"If a man, after the disappearance of the 3 fetters... is destined to full enlightenment, he, after having only once more returned to human existence, puts an end to suffering. Such a man is called 'one germinating only once more' (eka-bījī).\nA sotāpanna will not commit six wrong actions:\n\n\nThe Buddha spoke favorably about the sotapanna on many occasions, and even though it is (only) the first of \"ariya sangha\" members, he or she is welcomed by all other sangha-members for he or she practices for the benefit and welfare of many. In the literature, the \"arya sangha\" is described as \"the four\" when taken as pairs, and as \"the eight\" when taken as individual types. This refers to the four supra-mundane fruits (attainments: \"phala\") and the corresponding four supra-mundane paths (of those practicing to attain those fruits: \"magga\").\n\nThis is called \"the recollection of the Sangha\" (\"sanghanussati\"). It can also be interpreted as, \"They are the Blessed One's disciples, who have practiced well, who have practiced directly, who have practiced insight-fully, those who practice with integrity (to share what they have learned with others). They give occasion for incomparable goodness to arise in the world because gifts to them bear great fruit and benefit to the giver.\nThe fifty-fifth Samyutta of the Samyutta Nikaya is called the Sotāpatti-saṃyutta, and concerns sotapannas and their attainment. In the discourse-numbers (of that chapter) 1-4, 6-9, 11-14, 16-20, 22-36, 39-49, 51, 53, 54, sotapannas are praised as Sangha members by and to: the sick, lay followers, people on their deathbed, bhikkhunis, bhikkhus, and devas, and end up becoming the well-being and benefit of many.\n\nFrom Dhammapada verse 178:\n\nAccording to Mahāyāna Master Bhikshu Hsuan Hua's Commentary on the Vajra Sutra, \nVenerable Hsuan Hua continues, \n\n"}

The \"stochastic terrorist\" does not direct the actions of members of a group, rather, he is an ideologue speaking over mass media to individuals with who he is not affiliated as part of any form of organization. Instead, he depends on \"the use of mass media to provoke random acts of ideologically motivated violence that are statistically predictable but individually unpredictable\". According to an anonymous blogger posting on the Daily Kos, the speaker, whether intentionally or not, incites those with a combination of personality traits that leads them to violence. Since the speaker only focuses animus towards the victim instead of directly participating, they may escape culpability and the perpetrator may be labeled a lone wolf by law enforcement. The term has mostly been applied to domestic American incidents of violence.\n\nIn their 2017 book, Age of Lone Wolf Terrorism, criminologist Mark S. Hamm and sociologist Ramón Spaaij discuss stochastic terrorism as a form of \"indirect enabling\" of terrorists. They write that \"stochastic terrorism is the method of international recruitment used by ISIS\", and they refer to Anwar al-Awlaki and Alex Jones as stochastic terrorists. They note that:\n\nHamm and Spaaij discuss two instances of violence that \"shine a light on the phenomenon of stochastic terrorism in the post-9/11 era.\" In the 2010 Oakland freeway shootout, Byron Williams was said to be en route to offices of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tides Foundation, planning to commit mass murder, \"indirectly enabled by the conspiracy theories\" of Glenn Beck and Alex Jones. As a left-wing example, they cite the 2012 shooting incident at the headquarters of the Family Research Council. Hamm and Spaaij say the shooter's radicalization was indirectly enabled by his reading a report in an online magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which \"featured a 'Hate Map' giving the exact location of FRC headquarters.\"\n\nNote that the phrase \"stochastic terrorism model\" typically does not refer to this concept of stochastic terrorism as a form of incitement. That is, a stochastic terrorism model is usually a stochastic, that is, random, model of terror attacks intended by the random nature of their timing and targets to excite a generalized fear.\n\nAfter the 2011 Tucson shooting, the Daily Kos' \"diarist\" (blogger) G2geek posted \"Stochastic Terrorism: Triggering the shooters.\" While saying it wasn't immediately clear that the murderer Jared Lee Loughner was triggered, G2geek accused Osama Bin Laden and personalities such as Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity of inciting perpetrators such as Jim David Adkisson, Scott Roeder, and Byron Williams. \"Rawstory\" said that the 2015 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting was incited by far-right Christians. An op-ed in \"Rolling Stone\" referred to then presidential-candidate Donald Trump's comment during one of his 2016 campaign rallies as stochastic terrorism. Trump said of his opponent Hillary Clinton: \"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is. I don't know\". \"Salon\" tied these comments to a history of encouragement of violence by O'Reilly and other right-wing media personalities.\n\nCNN's legal analyst Danny Cevallos opinion piece said Trump's comment was likely protected speech, even against a presidential candidate, because it wasn't directed to inciting imminent unlawful action. And with respect to it being stochastic terrorism added, \"It's scary, and probably true... It's hard to predict or measure the effect with any certainty.\"\n\nThe phase \"Scripted Violence\" has been used in social science since at least 2010. As Darrell Y. Hamamoto argues, the concept of \"scripted violence\" provides \"a sorely-needed corrective to the under-theorization of race and racism in understanding acts of scripted violence within hyper-militarized society.\" Hamamoto also suggests that \"serial killing and mass murder are examples of civilian \"blowback\" that originates with heightened US military adventurism in the postwar period.\nA stochastic terrorist is a demagogue who uses the rhetoric of scripted violence (such as demonization or scapegoating) to portray a target group as involved in a malevolent conspiracy to undermine the society or nation, and thus prompt most acts of stochastic terrorism. See, for example, the work on demonization and scapegoating of scholars Hannah Arendt and Gordon Allport.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1415022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1415022", "title": "Supertaster", "text": "Supertaster\n\nA supertaster is a person who experiences the sense of taste with far greater intensity than average, with some studies showing an increased sensitivity to bitter tastes. It may be a cause of selective eating, but selective eaters are not necessarily supertasters, and vice versa.\n\nThe term originates with experimental psychologist Linda Bartoshuk who has spent much of her career studying genetic variation in taste perception. In the early 1980s, Bartoshuk and her colleagues noticed some individuals tested in the laboratory seemed to have an elevated taste response and took to calling them supertasters. This increased taste response is not the result of response bias or a scaling artifact, but appears to have an anatomical/biological basis.\n\nIn 1931, Arthur L. Fox, a DuPont chemist, discovered that some persons found phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) to be bitter while others found it tasteless. At the 1931 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Fox collaborated with Albert F. Blakeslee, a geneticist, to have attendees taste PTC: 65% found it bitter, 28% found it tasteless, and 6% described other taste qualities. Subsequent work revealed that the ability to taste PTC was genetic.\n\nIn the 1960s, Roland Fischer was the first to link the ability to taste PTC, and the related compound propylthiouracil (PROP), to food preference and body type. Today, PROP has replaced PTC in taste research because of a faint sulfurous odor and safety concerns with PTC. As described above, Bartoshuk and colleagues discovered that the taster group could be further divided into medium tasters and supertasters. Most estimates suggest 25% of the population are nontasters, 50% are medium tasters, and 25% are supertasters.\n\nThe cause of this heightened response is unknown, although it is thought to be related to the presence of the TAS2R38 gene, the ability to taste PROP and PTC, and, at least in part, due to an increased number of fungiform papillae. Any evolutionary advantage to supertasting is unclear. In some environments, heightened taste response, particularly to bitterness, would represent an important advantage in avoiding potentially toxic plant alkaloids. In other environments, increased response to bitterness may have limited the range of palatable foods.\n\nThe bitter-taste-receptor gene TAS2R38 has been associated with the ability to taste PROP and PTC; but it cannot completely explain supertasting. Still, the T2R38 genotype has been linked to a preference for sweetness in children, avoidance of alcoholic beverages, increased prevalence of colon cancer (because of inadequate vegetable consumption) and avoidance of cigarette smoking.\n\nWomen are more likely to be supertasters, as are those from Asia, South America, and Africa.\n\nSupertasters were initially identified on the basis of the perceived intensity of propylthiouracil (PROP) compared to a reference salt solution. However, because supertasters have a larger sense of taste than medium or nontasters, this can cause scaling artifacts. Subsequently, salt has been replaced with a non-oral auditory standard. That is, if two individuals rate the same physical stimulus at a comparable perceptual intensity, but one gives a rating twice as large for the bitterness of a PROP solution, the experimenter can be confident the difference is real and not merely the result of how the person is using the scale. Today, there is a phenylalanine test strip. The general population tastes this as bitter about 5% of the time.\n\nMany studies do not include a cross-modal reference and simply categorize individuals on the basis of the bitterness of a concentrated PROP solution or PROP impregnated paper. It is also possible to make a reasonably accurate self-diagnosis at home by careful examination of the tongue and looking for the number of fungiform papillae. Blue food dye can make this easier. Being a supertaster or nontaster is part of normal variation in the human population, as are eye color and hair color, so no treatment is needed.\n\nAlthough individual food preference for supertasters cannot be typified, documented examples for either lessened preference or consumption include:\n\n\nOther foods may also show altered patterns of preference and consumption, but only indirect evidence exists:\n\n\n"}

Trialism keeps the two substances of mind and body, but introduces a third attribute, sensation, belonging to the union of mind and body. This allows animals, which do not have thought, to be regarded as having sensation and not as being mere automata.\n\nChristian trialism is the doctrine that humans have three separate essences (body, soul, spirit), based on a literal interpretation of 1 Thessalonians 5:23 \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" This doctrine holds the soul to belong to the union of the body and the spirit, which makes it roughly compatible with philosophical trialism.

Taking their point of departure in a sexualised and socially provocative relationship between women and technology the works subversively questioned discourses of domination and control in the expanding cyber space. They are credited as being amongst the first artists to use the term cyberfeminism to describe their practice.\n\nVNS Matrix was an Australian feminist artist group who were active from 1991 to 1997.
