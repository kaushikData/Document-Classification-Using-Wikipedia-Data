Acts committed out of \"amour de soi\" tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because \"amour de soi\" as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with \"amour-propre\", that kind of self-love, found in Thomas Hobbes' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.\n\nRousseau suggested that \"amour de soi\" was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of \"good\" institutions created with the social contract. This renewed passage from the state of nature to the civilized state, would bring man to favor justice instead of instinct.\n"}
{"id": "751106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751106", "title": "Anchoring", "text": "Anchoring\n\nAnchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the \"anchor\") when making decisions.\n\nThe original description of the anchoring effect came from psychophysics where it was noticed when judging stimuli along a continuum that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other stimuli. This is often referred to as end anchoring. This was applied to attitudes by Sherif et al. in 1958 in their article \"Assimilation and contrast effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments\".\n\nDuring decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use this initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Those objects near the anchor tend to be assimilated toward it and those further away tend to be displaced in the other direction. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor. This bias occurs when interpreting future information using this anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car, set either before or at the start of negotiations, sets an arbitrary focal point for all following discussions. Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car.\n\nThe focusing effect (or focusing illusion) is a cognitive bias that occurs when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event, causing an error in accurately predicting the utility of a future outcome.\n\nPeople focus on notable differences, excluding those that are less conspicuous, when making predictions about happiness or convenience. For example, when people were asked how much happier they believe Californians are compared to Midwesterners, Californians and Midwesterners both said Californians must be considerably happier, when, in fact, there was no difference between the actual happiness rating of Californians and Midwesterners. The bias lies in that most people focused on and overweighed the sunny weather and ostensibly easy-going lifestyle of California and devalued and underrated other aspects of life and determinants of happiness, such as low crime rates and safety from natural disasters like earthquakes (both of which large parts of California lack).\n\nA rise in income has only a small and transient effect on happiness and well-being, but people consistently overestimate this effect. Academics Daniel Kahneman, along with A. Krueger, D. Schkade, N. Schwarz & A. Stone proposed that this is a result of a focusing illusion, with people focusing on conventional measures of achievement rather than on everyday routine.\n\nAnchoring and adjustment is a psychological heuristic that influences the way people intuitively assess probabilities. According to this heuristic, people start with an implicitly suggested reference point (the \"anchor\") and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate. A person begins with a first approximation (anchor) and then makes incremental adjustments based on additional information. These adjustments are usually insufficient, giving the initial anchor a great deal of influence over future assessments.\nThe anchoring and adjustment heuristic was first theorized by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman. In one of their first studies, participants were asked to compute, within 5 seconds, the product of the numbers one through eight, either as formula_1 or reversed as formula_2. Because participants did not have enough time to calculate the full answer, they had to make an estimate after their first few multiplications. When these first multiplications gave a small answer – because the sequence started with small numbers – the median estimate was 512; when the sequence started with the larger numbers, the median estimate was 2,250. (The correct answer is 40,320.) In another study by Tversky and Kahneman, participants observed a roulette wheel that was predetermined to stop on either 10 or 65. Participants were then asked to guess the percentage of the United Nations that were African nations. Participants whose wheel stopped on 10 guessed lower values (25% on average) than participants whose wheel stopped at 65 (45% on average). The pattern has held in other experiments for a wide variety of different subjects of estimation.\n\nAs a second example, in a study by Dan Ariely, an audience is first asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate and computer equipment. They were then asked to bid for these items, with the result that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers, which had become their anchor.\n\nVarious studies have shown that anchoring is very difficult to avoid. For example, in one study students were given anchors that were obviously wrong. They were asked whether Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, or before or after age 140. Clearly neither of these anchors can be correct, but when the two groups were asked to suggest when they thought he had died, they guessed significantly differently (average age of 50 vs. average age of 67).\n\nOther studies have tried to eliminate anchoring much more directly. In a study exploring the causes and properties of anchoring, participants were exposed to an anchor and asked to guess how many physicians were listed in the local phone book. In addition, they were explicitly informed that anchoring would \"contaminate\" their responses, and that they should do their best to correct for that. A control group received no anchor and no explanation. Regardless of how they were informed and whether they were informed correctly, all of the experimental groups reported higher estimates than the control group. Thus, despite being expressly aware of the anchoring effect, participants were still unable to avoid it. A later study found that even when offered monetary incentives, people are unable to effectively adjust from an anchor.\n\nSeveral theories have been put forth to explain what causes anchoring, although some explanations are more popular than others, there is no consensus as to which is best. In a study on possible causes of anchoring, two authors described anchoring as easy to demonstrate, but hard to explain. At least one group of researchers has argued that multiple causes are at play, and that what is called \"anchoring\" is actually several different effects.\n\nIn their original study, Tversky and Kahneman put forth a view later termed anchoring-as-adjustment. According to this theory, once an anchor is set, people adjust away from it to get to their final answer; however, they adjust insufficiently, resulting in their final guess being closer to the anchor than it would be otherwise. Other researchers also found evidence supporting the anchoring-and-adjusting explanation.\n\nHowever, later researchers criticized this model, because it is only applicable when the initial anchor is outside the range of acceptable answers. To use an earlier example, since Mahatma Gandhi obviously did not die at age 9, then people will adjust from there. If a reasonable number were given, though, there would be no adjustment. Therefore, this theory cannot, according to its critics, explain the anchoring effect.\n\nAnother study found that the anchoring effect holds even when the anchor is subliminal. According to Tversky and Kahneman's theory, this is impossible, since anchoring is only the result of conscious adjustment. Because of arguments like these, anchoring-and-adjusting has fallen out of favor.\n\nIn the same study that criticized anchoring-and-adjusting, the authors proposed an alternate explanation regarding selective accessibility, which is derived from a theory called \"confirmatory hypothesis testing\". In short, selective accessibility proposes that when given an anchor, a judge (i.e. a person making some judgment) will evaluate the hypothesis that the anchor thinks is a suitable answer. Assuming it is not, the judge moves on to another guess, but not before accessing all the relevant attributes of the anchor itself. Then, when evaluating the new answer, the judge looks for ways in which it is similar to the anchor, resulting in the anchoring effect. Various studies have found empirical support for this hypothesis. This explanation assumes that the judge considers the anchor to be a plausible value so that it is not immediately rejected, which would preclude considering its relevant attributes.\n\nMore recently, a third explanation of anchoring has been proposed concerning attitude change. According to this theory, providing an anchor changes someone's attitudes to be more favorable to the particular attributes of that anchor, biasing future answers to have similar characteristics as the anchor. Leading proponents of this theory consider it to be an alternate explanation in line with prior research on anchoring-and-adjusting and selective accessibility.\n\nA wide range of research has linked sad or depressed moods with more extensive and accurate evaluation of problems. As a result of this, earlier studies hypothesized that people with more depressed moods would tend to use anchoring less than those with happier moods. However, more recent studies have shown the opposite effect: sad people are \"more\" likely to use anchoring than people with happy or neutral mood.\n\nEarly research found that experts (those with high knowledge, experience, or expertise in some field) were more resistant to the anchoring effect. Since then, however, numerous studies have demonstrated that while experience can sometimes reduce the effect, even experts are susceptible to anchoring. In a study concerning the effects of anchoring on judicial decisions, researchers found that even experienced legal professionals were affected by anchoring. This remained true even when the anchors provided were arbitrary and unrelated to the case in question.\n\nResearch has correlated susceptibility to anchoring with most of the Big Five personality traits. People high in agreeableness and conscientiousness are more likely to be affected by anchoring, while those high in extraversion are less likely to be affected. Another study found that those high in openness to new experiences were more susceptible to the anchoring effect.\n\nThe impact of cognitive ability on anchoring is contested. A recent study on willingness to pay for consumer goods found that anchoring decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear. Another study, however, found that cognitive ability had no significant effect on how likely people were to use anchoring.\n\nIn negotiations, anchoring is setting a boundary that outlines the basic constraints for a negotiation. The anchoring effect is where we set our estimation for the true value of the item at hand. In addition to the initial research conducted by Tversky and Kahneman, multiple other studies have shown that anchoring can greatly influence the estimated value of an object. For instance, although negotiators can generally appraise an offer based on multiple characteristics, studies have shown that they tend to focus on only one aspect. In this way, a deliberate starting point can strongly affect the range of possible counteroffers. The process of offer and counteroffer results in a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, multiple studies have shown that initial offers have a stronger influence on the outcome of negotiations than subsequent counteroffers.\n\nAn example of the power of anchoring has been conducted during the Strategic Negotiation Process Workshops. During the workshop, a group of participants is divided into two sections: buyers and sellers. Each side receives identical information about the other party before going into a one-on-one negotiation. Following this exercise, both sides debrief about their experiences. The results show that where the participants anchor the negotiation had a significant effect on their success.\n\nAnchoring affects everyone, even people who are highly knowledgeable in a field. Northcraft and Neale conducted a study to measure the difference in the estimated value of a house between students and real-estate agents. In this experiment, both groups were shown a house and then given different listing prices. After making their offer, each group was then asked to discuss what factors influenced their decisions. In the follow-up interviews, the real-estate agents denied being influenced by the initial price, but the results showed that both groups were equally influenced by that anchor.\n\nAnchoring can have more subtle effects on negotiations as well. Janiszewski and Uy investigated the effects of precision of an anchor. Participants read an initial price for a beach house, then gave the price they thought it was worth. They received either a general, seemingly nonspecific anchor (e.g., $800,000) or a more precise and specific anchor (e.g., $799,800). Participants with a general anchor adjusted their estimate more than those given a precise anchor ($751,867 vs $784,671). The authors propose that this effect comes from difference in scale; in other words, the anchor affects not only the starting \"value\", but also the starting \"scale\". When given a general anchor of $20, people will adjust in large increments ($19, $21, etc.), but when given a more specific anchor like $19.85, people will adjust on a lower scale ($19.75, $19.95, etc.). Thus, a more specific initial price will tend to result in a final price closer to the initial one.\n\n"}

{"id": "261128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=261128", "title": "Bloom's taxonomy", "text": "Bloom's taxonomy\n\nBloom's taxonomy is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and sensory domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.\n\nThe models were named after Benjamin Bloom, who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, \"Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals\".\n\nAlthough named after Bloom, the publication of \"Taxonomy of Educational Objectives\" followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations.\n\nThe first volume of the taxonomy, \"Handbook I: Cognitive\" was published in 1956, and in 1964 the second volume \"Handbook II: Affective\" was published. A revised version of the taxonomy for the cognitive domain was created in 2001.\n\nIn the original version of the taxonomy, the cognitive domain is broken into the following six levels of objectives. In the 2001 revised edition of Bloom's taxonomy, the levels are slightly different: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create (rather than Synthesize).\n\nKnowledge involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean. Its characteristics may include:\n\n\"Example\": Name three common varieties of apple.\n\nComprehension involves demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.\n\n\"Example\": Compare the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious apple with a Granny Smith apple.\n\nApplication involves using acquired knowledge—solving problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations.\n\n\"Example\": Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C?\n\nAnalysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations. Its characteristics include:\n\n\"Example\": List four ways of serving foods made with apples and explain which ones have the highest health benefits. Provide references to support your statements.\n\nSynthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole. Its characteristics include:\n\n\"Example\": Convert an \"unhealthy\" recipe for apple pie to a \"healthy\" recipe by replacing your choice of ingredients. Explain the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose vs. the original ones.\n\nEvaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. Its characteristics include:\n\n\"Example\": Which kinds of apples are best for baking a pie, and why?\n\nSkills in the affective domain describe the way people react emotionally and their ability to feel other living things' pain or joy. Affective objectives typically target the awareness and growth in attitudes, emotion, and feelings.\n\nThere are five levels in the affective domain moving through the lowest-order processes to the highest.\n\nThe lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level, no learning can occur. Receiving is about the student's memory and recognition as well.\n\nThe student actively participates in the learning process, not only attends to a stimulus; the student also reacts in some way.\n\nThe student attaches a value to an object, phenomenon, or piece of information. The student associates a value or some values to the knowledge they acquired.\n\nThe student can put together different values, information, and ideas, and can accommodate them within his/her own schema; the student is comparing, relating and elaborating on what has been learned.\n\nThe student at this level tries to build abstract knowledge.\n\nSkills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate a tool or instrument like a hand or a hammer. Psychomotor objectives usually focus on change and/or development in behavior and/or skills.\n\nBloom and his colleagues never created subcategories for skills in the psychomotor domain, but since then other educators have created their own psychomotor taxonomies. Simpson (1972) proposed the following levels:\n\nThe ability to use sensory cues to guide motor activity: This ranges from sensory stimulation, through cue selection, to translation.\n\n\"Examples\": Detects non-verbal communication cues. Estimate where a ball will land after it is thrown and then moving to the correct location to catch the ball. Adjusts heat of the stove to correct temperature by smell and taste of food. Adjusts the height of the forks on a forklift by comparing where the forks are in relation to the pallet.\n\n\"Key words\": chooses, describes, detects, differentiates, distinguishes, identifies, isolates, relates, selects.\n\nReadiness to act: It includes mental, physical, and emotional sets. These three sets are dispositions that predetermine a person's response to different situations (sometimes called mindsets). This subdivision of psychomotor is closely related with the \"responding to phenomena\" subdivision of the affective domain.\n\n\"Examples\": Knows and acts upon a sequence of steps in a manufacturing process. Recognizes his or her abilities and limitations. Shows desire to learn a new process (motivation).\n\n\"Keywords\": begins, displays, explains, moves, proceeds, reacts, shows, states, volunteers.\n\nThe early stages of learning a complex skill that includes imitation and trial and error: Adequacy of performance is achieved by practicing.\n\n\"Examples\": Performs a mathematical equation as demonstrated. Follows instructions to build a model. Responds to hand-signals of the instructor while learning to operate a forklift.\n\n\"Keywords\": copies, traces, follows, react, reproduce, responds.\n\nThe intermediate stage in learning a complex skill: Learned responses have become habitual and the movements can be performed with some confidence and proficiency.\n\n\"Examples\": Use a personal computer. Repair a leaking tap. Drive a car.\n\n\"Key words\": assembles, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.\n\nThe skillful performance of motor acts that involve complex movement patterns: Proficiency is indicated by a quick, accurate, and highly coordinated performance, requiring a minimum of energy. This category includes performing without hesitation and automatic performance. For example, players will often utter sounds of satisfaction or expletives as soon as they hit a tennis ball or throw a football because they can tell by the feel of the act what the result will produce.\n\n\"Examples\": Maneuvers a car into a tight parallel parking spot. Operates a computer quickly and accurately. Displays competence while playing the piano.\n\n\"Key words\": assembles, builds, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches. (Note: The key words are the same as in mechanism, but will have adverbs or adjectives that indicate that the performance is quicker, better, more accurate, etc.)\n\nSkills are well developed and the individual can modify movement patterns to fit special requirements.\n\n\"Examples\": Responds effectively to unexpected experiences. Modifies instruction to meet the needs of the learners. Performs a task with a machine that was not originally intended for that purpose (the machine is not damaged and there is no danger in performing the new task).\n\n\"Key words\": adapts, alters, changes, rearranges, reorganizes, revises, varies.\n\nCreating new movement patterns to fit a particular situation or specific problem: Learning outcomes emphasize creativity based upon highly developed skills.\n\n\"Examples\": Constructs a new set or pattern of movements organized around a novel concept or theory. Develops a new and comprehensive training program. Creates a new gymnastic routine.\n\n\"Key words\": arranges, builds, combines, composes, constructs, creates, designs, initiate, makes, originates.\n\nIn the appendix to \"Handbook I\", there is a definition of knowledge which serves as the apex for an alternative, summary classification of the educational goals. This is significant as the taxonomy has been called upon significantly in other fields such as knowledge management, potentially out of context. \"Knowledge, as defined here, involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting.\"\n\nThe taxonomy is set out as follows:\n\nAs pointed out on the publication of the second volume, the classification was not a properly constructed taxonomy, as it lacked a systemic rationale of construction.\n\nThis was subsequently acknowledged in the discussion of the original taxonomy in its 2001 revision, and the taxonomy was reestablished on more systematic lines. \n\nSome critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link. Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy of teaching. The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of natural history). Instructional scaffolding of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of Vygotskian constructivism.\n\nSome consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel. Others say that it is sometimes better to move to Application before introducing concepts, the idea is to create a learning environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept or event. This \nthinking would seem to relate to the method of problem-based learning.\n\nFurthermore, the distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition. This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.\n\nBloom's taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular, those that lean more towards skills rather than content. These educators view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creation. Bloom's taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance assessment and evaluative questions in class, assignments and texts to ensure all orders of thinking are exercised in students' learning, including aspects of information searching.\n\nThe skill development that takes place at these higher orders of thinking interacts well with a developing global focus on multiple literacies and modalities in learning and the emerging field of integrated disciplines. The ability to interface with and create media would draw upon skills from multiple levels of the taxonomy including analysis, application and creation. Bloom's taxonomy (and the revised taxonomy) continues to be a source of inspiration for educational philosophy and for developing new teaching strategies.\n\n"}
{"id": "22244475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22244475", "title": "Child abduction", "text": "Child abduction\n\nChild abduction or child theft is the unauthorized removal of a minor (a child under the age of legal adulthood) from the custody of the child's natural parents or legally appointed guardians.\nThe term child abduction conflates two legal and social categories which differ by their perpetrating contexts: abduction by members of the child's family or abduction by strangers:\n\n\nNeonatal \"infant abduction\" and prenatal fetal abduction are the earliest ages of child abduction as defined by a viable child through the age of majority. In addition, \"embryo theft\" and even \"oocyte misappropriation\" in reproductive medical settings have been legalistically construed as child abduction.\n\nThe stereotypical version of child abduction by a stranger is the classic form of \"kidnapping,\" exemplified by the Lindbergh kidnapping, in which the child is detained, transported some distance, held for ransom or with intent to keep the child permanently. These instances are rare.\n\nThe earliest nationally publicised kidnapping of a child by a stranger for the purpose of extracting a ransom payment from the parents was the Pool case of 1819, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland. Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the \"Baltimore Patriot\" newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23—through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search—it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method. Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in \"Baltimore Patriot\" (June 26, 1819). The June 26 article, as well as others on the case that had appeared in the \"Patriot\", were reprinted in newspapers in other states including: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C.\n\nIn 1597, Elizabeth I of England licensed the abduction of children for use as chapel choristers and theatre performers.\n\nThere are reports that abduction of children to be used or sold as slaves is common in parts of Africa.\n\nThe Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel paramilitary group operating mainly in northern Uganda, is notorious for its abductions of children for use as child soldiers or sex slaves. According to the Sudan Tribune, , more than 30,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA and their leader, Joseph Kony.\n\nA very small number of abductions result from - in most cases - women who kidnap babies (or other young children) to bring up as their own. These women are often unable to have children of their own, or have miscarried, and seek to satisfy their unmet psychological need by abducting a child rather than by adopting. The crime is often premeditated, with the woman often simulating pregnancy to reduce suspicion when a baby suddenly appears in the household.\n\nHistorically, a few states have practiced child abduction for indoctrination, as a form of punishment for political opponents, or for profit. Notable cases include the kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany (400,000 children kidnapped for possible Germanization), the lost children of Francoism, during which an estimated 300,000 children were abducted from their parents. and the about 500 \"Children of the Disappeared (Desaparecidos)\" who were adopted by the military in the Argentine Dirty War . In Australia the 'stolen generation' is the term given to native Aboriginal children who were forcibly abducted or whose mothers gave consent under duress or misleading information so the government could assimilate the black population into the white majority.\n\nSome other abductions have been to make children available by child-selling for adoption by other people, without adopting parents necessarily being aware of how children were actually made available for adoption.\n\nBy far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone) and often occurs when the parents separate or begin divorce proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an \"access visit\" or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of domestic violence and abuse.\n\nParental child abductions may be within the same city, within the state region or within the same country, or may be international. Studies performed for the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reported that in 1999, 53% percent of family abducted children were gone less than one week, and 21% were gone one month or more.\n\nInternational child abduction occurs when a parent, relative or acquaintance of a child leaves the country with the child or children in violation of a custody decree or visitation order. Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.\n\nWhile the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions. Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.\n\nThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.\n\nBy 2007, both the United States, European authorities, and NGO's had begun serious interest in the use of mediation as a means by which some international child abduction cases may be resolved. The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE, a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful. Their reported success lead to the first international training for cross-border mediation in 2008, sponsored by NCMEC. Held at the University of Miami School of Law, Lawyers, Judges, and certified mediators interested in international child abduction cases, attended.\n\nInternational child abduction is not new. A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate. Parental abduction has been defined as child abuse.\n\nLaunched in 1998 as a joint venture of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) and NCMEC, the Global Missing Children's Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations. The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.\n\nEach country can access a customizable website platform, and can enter missing children information into a centralized, multilingual database that has photos of and information about missing children, which can be viewed and distributed to assist in location and recovery efforts. GMCN staff train new countries joining the Network, and provide an annual member conference sponsored by Motorola Solutions Foundation at which best practices, current issues, trends, policies, procedures, and possible solutions are discussed.\n\nThe parents of Madeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl who disappeared from her bed in a hotel in Portugal in 2007, approached ICMEC to help them publicize her case. ICMEC's YouTube channel, \"Don'tYouForgetAboutMe,\" which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and had 2,200 members. ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate.\n\nSee the Child Abduction Act 1984, the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 and the Child Abduction (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.\n\n\n"}

Note that the classical general equilibrium model is unrelated to classical economics, and was instead developed within neoclassical economics beginning in the late 19th century.\n\nIn the model, the individual is assumed to be the basic unit of analysis and these individuals, both workers and employers, will make choices that reflect their unique tastes, objectives, and preferences. It is assumed that individuals' wants typically exceed their ability to satisfy them (hence scarcity of goods and time). It is further assumed that individuals will eventually experience diminishing marginal utility. Finally, wages and prices are assumed to be elastic (they move up and down freely). The classical model assumes that traditional supply and demand analysis is the best approach to understanding the labor market. The functions that follow are aggregate functions that can be thought of as the summation of all the individual participants in the market.\n\nThe consumers of the labor market are firms. The demand for labor services is a derived demand, derived from the supply and demand for the firm's products in the goods market. It is assumed that a firm's objective is to maximize profit given the demand for its products, and given the production technology that is available to it.\n\nSome notation:\n\nLet us specify this output (commodity supply) function as:\nIt is an increasing concave function with respect to L because of the Diminishing Marginal Product of Labor. Note that in this simplified model, labour is the only factor of production. If we were analysing the goods market, this simplification could cause problems, but because we are looking at the labor market, this simplification is worthwhile.\n\nGenerally a firm's profit is calculated as:\nIn \"nominal terms\" the profit function is:\nIn \"real terms\" this becomes:\n\nIn an attempt to achieve an optimal situation, firms can maximize profits with this \"Maximized profit function\":\nWhen functions are given, Labor Demand (L) can be derived from this equation.\n\nThe suppliers of the labor market are households. A household can be thought of as the summation of all the individuals within the household. Each household offers an amount of labour services to the market. The supply of labour can be thought of as the summation of the labour services offered by all the households. The amount of service that each household offers depends on the consumption requirements of the household, and the individuals relative preference for consumption verses free time.\n\nSome notation:\n\nConsumption constraint = profit income + wage income<br>\n\ntotal utility = utility from consumption - disutility from work <br>\nformula_12<br>\nsubstitute consumption: <br>\nformula_13\n\nMaximized utility function: <br>\nformula_14<br>\nWhen functions are given, Labor Supply (L) can be derived from this equation.\n\nY = C + I + G\nwhereby Y is output, C is consumption, I is investment and G is government spending\n\nMV=PY(Fisher's Equation of Exchange)\n"}

In order to directly prove a conditional statement of the form \"If \"p\", then \"q\"\", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement \"p\" is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably first-order logic, employing the quantifiers \"for all\" and \"there exists\". Common proof rules used are modus ponens and universal instantiation.\n\nIn contrast, an indirect proof may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly \"p\" ⇒ \"q\", one proves its contrapositive ~\"q\" ⇒ ~\"p\" (one assumes ~\"q\" and shows that it leads to ~\"p\"). Since \"p\" ⇒ \"q\" and ~\"q\" ⇒ ~\"p\" are equivalent by the principle of transposition (see law of excluded middle), \"p\" ⇒ \"q\" is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include proof by contradiction, including proof by infinite descent. Direct proof methods include proof by exhaustion and proof by induction.\n\nA direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word ‘proof’ comes from the Latin word probare, which means “to test”. The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony. In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions – with populations like the Egyptians and the Greeks showing an interest in surveying land. This led to a natural curiosity with regards to geometry and trigonometry – particularly triangles and rectangles. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the circle, which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and Euclidean Geometry) discussed circles.\n\nThe earliest form of mathematics was phenomenological. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical “fact”. On occasion, analogical arguments took place, or even by “invoking the gods”. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.\n\nProof as we know it came about with one specific question: “what is a proof?” Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a comparison with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.\n\nConsider two even integers and . Since they are even, they can be written as\n\nrespectively for integers and . \nThen the sum can be written as\n\nIt follows that has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.\n\nObserve that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a large square. Each of the triangles has sides \"a\" and \"b\" and hypotenuse \"c\". The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides - in this case, \"(a + b)\". However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.\n\nWe know that the area of the large square is equal to \"(a + b)\".\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to formula_5\n\nWe know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals formula_6\n\nThese are equal, and so\n\nAfter some simplifying,\n\nRemoving the ab that appears on both sides gives\n\nwhich proves Pythagoras' theorem. ∎\n\nBy definition, if \"n\" is an odd integer, it can be expressed as\nfor some integer \"k\". Thus\n\nSince 2\"k\"+ 2\"k\" is an integer, \"n\" is also odd. ∎\n\n\n"}

DGVMs use time series of climate data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes. DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future climate change on natural vegetation and its carbon and water cycles.\n\nDGVMs generally combine biogeochemistry, biogeography, and disturbance submodels. Disturbance is often limited to wildfires, but in principle could include any of: forest/land management decisions, windthrow, insect damage, ozone damage etc. DGVMs usually \"spin up\" their simulations from bare ground to equilibrium vegetation (e.g. climax community) to establish realistic initial values for their various \"pools\": carbon and nitrogen in live and dead vegetation, soil organic matter, etc. corresponding to a documented historical vegetation cover.\n\nDGVMs are usually run in a spatially distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of \"cells\", geographic points which are assumed to have homogeneous conditions within each cell. Simulations are carried out across a range of spatial scales, from global to landscape. Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc-seconds. Simulations of the conterminous United States in the first DGVM comparison exercise (LPJ and MC1) called the VEMAP project in the 1990s used a lattice grain of one-half degree. Global simulations by the PIK group and collaborators using 6 different DGVMs (HYBRID, IBIS, LPJ, SDGVM, TRIFFID, and VECODE) used the same resolution as the general circulation model (GCM) that provided the climate data, 3.75 deg longitude x 2.5 deg latitude, a total of 1631 land grid cells. Sometimes lattice distances are specified in kilometers rather than angular measure, especially for finer grains, so a project like VEMAP is often referred to as 50 km grain.\n\nSeveral DGVMs appeared in the middle 1990s.

{"id": "15225843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15225843", "title": "Ecogovernmentality", "text": "Ecogovernmentality\n\nEcogovernmentality, (or environmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government (Malette, 2009). Begun in the mid-1990s by a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies.\n\nFollowing Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.\n\nEcogovernmentality is part of the broader area of political ecology. It can be situated within the ongoing debates over how to balance concern with socio-natural relationships with attention to the actual environmental impact of specific interactions. The term is most useful to authors like Bryant, Watts and Peet who argue for the importance of a phenomenology of nature that builds from post-structuralist concerns with knowledge, power and discourse. In addition, it is of particular use to geographers because of its ability to link place based socio-environmental phenomena with the non-place based influences of both national and international systems of governance. Particularly, for studies of environmental changes that extend beyond the borders one particular region, ecogovernmentality can prove a useful analytical tool for tracing the manifestations of specific policy across scales ranging from the individual, the community, the state and on to larger structures of international environmental governance.\n\nWork done by Rutherford, on US Environmental Impact Assessments, and by Agrawal on local forest governance in India, are examples of this method of analysis. Both illustrate how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (statistical models of pollution, or the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (the EIA assessment regime or local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state. This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes behavior in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and intervention.\n\nWithin a geographical context, this type of analysis provides insight into how territory is brought under state control, and how the regulation of human interaction with this territory is achieved. Focusing on the evolution of techniques of cartography, systems of natural classification, and early attempts at scientific resource management in the 18th and 19th centuries, Braun (2000, 2003) and Scott (1998) show how new systems of knowledge extend systems of governmentality into the natural world. Fundamental to this analysis is a connection between the abstract utilitarian logic employed by states and the shape of the territory under their control. In Scott, for example, measuring nature in terms of concepts of production and natural resources “allowed the state to impose that logic on the very reality that was observed” (Scott, 14). The complex natural systems of a given place are first depicted as simplified sites of managed resource extraction. As part of this management their ecological composition is changed (through types of planting, harvesting and extraction) in an attempt to make them resemble more closely the simplified statistical systems with which they are measured.\n\nIn this manifestation, which focuses primarily on the administration of particular resources at a national level, ecogovernmentality is linked to the larger governmental aims identified by Foucault of securing the wellbeing of its inhabitants by managing “a complex composed of men and things” (93). Scott’s work on scientific forestry in early modern Europe shows how the rational models constructed by state foresters were part of the larger body of statistical knowledge created to manage population and facilitate “taxation, political control, and conscription” (23). Likewise, Braun’s analysis of the Geological Survey of Canada creates a clear link between methods of measuring and representing the mineral composition of a territory, and the structures of government put in place both to create the concept of a unified nation and “to manage individuals, goods and wealth so as to improve the condition of the state’s population” (27).\n\nHere, ecogovernmentality is seen as a subset of concerns within of the larger Foucauldian concept. But implicit in this is an important claim: that the types of knowledge produced in the process of making nature intelligible to the state have an important influence on the evolution of state rationality itself, an influence not adequately covered in Foucault’s original formulation. They seek to add to Foucault’s discussion of population and the operation of systems of knowledge/power that normalized certain ways of acting and being and marginalized others. Building on Foucault’s brief references to “resources, means of subsistence [and] the territory with its specific qualities”(93), their contribution is the investigation of the parallel systems of measuring and assigning value to the natural world (the “crop” and the “weed” (Scott, 13) acting as homologies to categories like “sanity” and “insanity” in Foucault’s work) and to give these their due in discussions of the formation of state rationality and structures of governmentality.\n\nThe work of Timothy Luke pushes the reach of this concept further, by envisaging a radically different relationship between governmentality and ecogovernmentality. He argues that the ecological domain has become the “ultimate domain of being”(150) the key location for the production of knowledge and power. Following Foucault, Luke traces this transformation back to a specific historical moment, the period of the early 70s encompassing the oil crisis and the détente between the USSR and the US. From these beginnings, environmental considerations grow, fertilized during the 1980s by the formation of international bodies, like the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, and increased concern and awareness over ecological limits to human development. The end result is the “environmentalization” of the production and exercise of knowledge and power. Reversing the earlier focus on the integration of environmental knowledge into broader state projects of socio-economic management, here it is these projects themselves which are reshaped by new forms of environmental knowledge (specifically the concepts of “ecology” and “sustainability”). It is this new structure that becomes known as Ecogovernmentality.\n\nLuke argues that heightened awareness of social vulnerability to environmental factors coupled with the increased importance of macro-economic competition (rather than Cold-War military confrontation) in geo-political power struggles led to the rise of sustainable development as the synthesis of these two interrelated concerns. The disciplinary power of governmentality is refigured as “enviro-discipline”, a broader concept that “expresses the authority of eco-knowledgeable, geo-powered forces to police the fitness of all biological organisms and the health of their natural environments” (146). This constitutes an important expansion of the object of governmental rule and the area to be managed. Foucault’s focus on “population” now includes “all of life’s biodiversity” (Luke, 122) and, given the interconnected nature of environmental systems, states must now seek to extend their control far outside of their territorial boundaries to ensure the security and productivity of their population (Luke 134).\n\nUniting both broad and narrow definitions of Ecogovernmentality is the attention paid to environmental subject formation, or the creation of environmental subject positions. Definitions of these subject positions vary from Darrier’s (1999) construction of the environmental subject as a site for resistance to consumerism and the commodification of the relationship between the individual and the environment, through Agrawal’s broadly neutral concept of “environmentality” which denotes an acceptance on the part of the individual that nature is an object to be managed and their accompanying involvement in this process, to Luke’s (1999) assertion that “the environment emerges as a ground for normalizing individual behavior” that supersedes the previous influences of “the ethical concerns of family, community and nation” (149). Underlying these divergent definitions, is the common claim that the relationship between individual and environment is key to current analysis of systems of state management and governmentality.\n\nSince about 2002, scholars have analyzed the discourses surrounding global climate change and related policies using ideas from Foucault and from ecogovernmentality.\n\nThis subfield or application of ecogovernmentality developed first by applying Foucauldean thought to analysis of national and international climate regimes, identifying categories and methodologies that work particularly well for climate change issues. As the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change has evolved, the principles of the theory have also been applied — in appropriately modified ways — to studies of state and local government as well as private and nonprofit organizations.\n\nEcogovernmentality-grounded theories and methods of analysis have also begun to emerge as tools for examining climate change in fields outside political economy, such as communications and international relations.\n\nAs researchers began to explore the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change problems and discourses, most studies focused on national and global scales. For example, an early study by Paul Henman applied governmentality to Australian national policy and climate change modeling, concluding that modeling was a technology for rendering climate governable though it would limit the capacity of government to respond. Sverker Jagers and Johannes Stripple’s work published in 2003 identified the importance of non-nation-state actors (NNSAs) in climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts and suggested that “private regimes” like the insurance industry may be more successful than national and global power structures in addressing the problem.\n\nStudies applying governmentality to climate change picked up in frequency in the mid-2000s. Angela Oels’ 2005 paper summarized the initial forays into governmentality-based analyses for climate change discourses and suggested that the functioning governmentality of the issue had shifted since the 1980s, from a biopower-based discourse to one rooted in advanced liberal government. She demonstrated a method of discourse analysis particularly suited for addressing climate change, examining objectives, fields of visibility, technical aspects, forms of knowledge and formation of identities. Oels also provided some categories into which discourses can be sorted. These categories were also used by Karin Bäckstrand and Eva Lövbrand, beginning in 2006 with analysis of tree-planting initiatives stemming from the Kyoto Protocol. Their analysis of competing discourses in categories of ecological modernization, green governmentality, and civic environmentalism revealed areas of overlap and potential cooperation.\n\nAlso in 2006, Maria Carmen Lemos collaborated with Agrawal on a comprehensive summary of environmental governance studies to that date. They divided the applications of these studies into two categories: resource management and climate change. Among other useful insights, their work provided a clear schematic for classifying new, hybrid forms of environmental governance and identifying where these forms derive their power — that is, from combinations of the state, the community, and the market.\n\nMore recent studies have applied ecogovernmentality precepts to discourses at state and local levels. Chukwumerije Okereke, Harriet Bulkeley and Heike Schroeder published a study in 2009 that examined possible problems of power, relationships, structures, and agency in climate governance at scales other than national or global. They suggested that examining these issues may help to overcome what they identify as an “impasse” in governmentality studies of global environmental problems.\n\nAs another example of an ecogovernmentality study of climate change at a non-global, non-national scale, Bulkeley’s 2010 paper examined network governance, vertical and horizontal power structures, political economics, the restructuring of the state, and institutional capacity, all at the urban scale. Bulkeley argued for the importance of nuanced analyses of government at non-national, non-global scales as an important field in climate change governmentality studies.\n\nA survey study from Dallas Elgin, Andrew Pattison and Christopher M. Weible in 2011 examines analytical capacity regarding climate change at the (U.S.) state level, concluding that the neoliberal government there is not as “hollowed out” as they expected but still lacks needed analytical capacity.\n\nEcogovernmentality-grounded studies in climate change are also emerging in fields outside political economy. For example, Max Boykoff’s work analyzing media coverage of climate change in his 2011 book was grounded in discourses analysis along with his perhaps-better-known content analysis methods. Peter Weingart, Anita Engels and Petra Pansegrau published a study using a similar combination of methods in 2000, but Boykoff’s work was cited in An Inconvenient Truth and has received far more scholarly and public attention. Other media studies scholars have followed Boykoff’s lead incorporating discourses analysis in their work.\n\nIn another communications-related study, David Ockwell, Lorraine Whitmarsh and Saffron O’Neill applied governmentality concepts to a U.K. government marketing campaign aimed at increasing “green” behaviors in citizens. In their analysis of why the campaign was ineffective, they identify regime-based barriers to behavior change, including infrastructure, financial, and structural barriers.\n\nChris Methmann has published work on global warming as a form of global governmentality in the field of international relations, citing the carbon market as a means of conducting individual conduct from a global scale. He concluded that the Clean Development Mechanism of carbon credit trading has become easily established because it protects “business as usual” – the established order of power.\n\nRobyn Dowling argued for inclusion of ecogovernmentality perspectives regarding identity formation in the field of human geography in her 2008 paper, which addressed a variety of issues, including climate change.\n\n"}

Alternatively, \"the Freudian notion of a perfect or ideal self housed in the superego,\" consisting of \"the individual's conscious and unconscious images of what he would like to be, patterned after certain people whom ... he regards as ideal.\"\n\nIn the French strand of Freudian psychology, the ego ideal (or ideal ego, ) has been defined as \"an image of the perfect self towards which the ego should aspire.\"\n\nIn Freud's \"On Narcissism: an Introduction\" [1914], among other innovations — \"most important of all perhaps — it introduces the concepts of the 'ego ideal' and of the self-observing agency related to it, which were the basis of what was ultimately to be described as the 'super-ego' in \"The Ego and the Id\" (1923b).\" Freud considered that the ego ideal was the heir to the narcissism of childhood: the \"ideal ego is now the target of the self-love which was enjoyed in childhood by the actual ego ... is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood.\"\n\nThe decade that followed would see the concept playing an ever more important and fruitful part in his thinking. In \"Mourning and Melancholia\" [1917], Freud stressed how \"one part of the ego sets itself over against the other, judges it critically, and, as it were, takes it as its object.\" A few years later, in \"Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego\" (1921), he examined further how \"some such agency develops in our ego which may cut itself off from the rest of the ego and come into conflict with it. We have called it the 'ego ideal'... heir to the original narcissism in which the childish ego enjoyed self-sufficiency.\" Freud reiterated how \"in many forms of love-choice ... the object serves as a substitute for some unattained ego ideal of our own,\" and further suggested that in group formation \"the group ideal ... governs the ego in the place of the ego ideal.\"\n\nWith \"The Ego and the Id\" [1923], however, Freud's nomenclature began to change. He still emphasised the importance of \"the existence of a grade in the ego, a differentiation in the ego, which may be called the 'ego ideal' or 'super-ego',\" but it was the latter term which now came to the forefront of his thinking. \"Indeed, after \"The Ego and the Id\" and the two or three shorter works immediately following it, the 'ego ideal' disappears almost completely as a technical term\" for Freud. When it briefly reappears in the \"New Introductory Lectures\"[1933], it was as \"part\" of \"this super-ego ... the vehicle of the ego ideal by which the ego measures itself ... precipitate of the old picture of the parents, the expression of admiration for the perfection which the child then attributed to them.\"\n\nErnest Jones records that \"I once asked Freud if he regarded an 'ego-ideal' as a universal attribute, and he replied with a puzzled expression: 'Do you think Stekel has an ego-ideal?'.\"\n\nFreud's followers would continue to exploit the potential tension between the concepts of superego and ego ideal. \"Hermann Nunberg defined the ideal ego as the combination of the ego and the id. This agency is the outcome of omnipotent narcissism and is manifested as pathology.\" Otto Fenichel, building on Sandor Rado's \"differentiation of the 'good' (i.e., protecting) and the 'bad' (i.e., punishing) aspects of the superego\" explored attempts to \"distinguish ego ideals, the patterns of what one would like to be, from the superego, which is characterized as a threatening, prohibiting, and punishing power\": while acknowledging the linkages between the two agencies, he suggested for example that \"in humor the overcathected superego is the friendly and protective ego-ideal; in depression, it is the negative, hostile, punishing conscience.\"\n\nKleinians like Herbert Rosenfeld \"re-invoked Freud's earlier emphasis on the importance of the ego ideal in narcissism, and conceived of a characteristic internal object — a chimerical montage or monster, one might say — that was constructed of the ego, the ego ideal, and the 'mad omnipotent self'.\" In their wake, Otto Kernberg highlighted the destructive qualities of the \"infantile, grandiose ego ideal\" - of \"identification with an overidealized self- and object-representation, with the primitive form of ego-ideal.\"\n\nHarold Bloom has since explored in a literary context how \"in the narcissist, the ego-ideal becomes inflated and destructive, because it is filled with images of 'perfection and omnipotence'.\" Escape from such \"intense, excessive, and sometimes fatal devotion to the ego-ideal\" — \"to the narcissist, the only reality is the ego-ideal\" — is only possible when one \"gives up his corrupt ego-ideal and affirms the innocence of humility.\"\n\nThe ideal ego is a concept that has been particularly exploited in French psychoanalysis. Whereas Freud \"seemed to use the terms indiscriminately ... ideal ego or ego ideal,\" in the thirties 'Hermann Nunberg, following Freud, had introduced a split into this concept, making the \"Ideal-Ich\" genetically prior to the \"surmoi\" (superego). Thereafter Daniel Lagache developed the distinction, asserting with particular reference to adolescence that \"the adolescent identifies him- or herself anew with the ideal ego and strives by this means to separate from the superego and the ego ideal.\"\n\nLacan for his part explored the concept in terms of the subject's \"narcissistic identification ... his ideal ego, that point at which he desires to gratify himself in himself.\" For Lacan, \"the subject has to regulate the completion of what comes as ... ideal ego — which is not the ego ideal — that is to say, to constitute himself in his imaginary reality.\"\n\n\"Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel (1985) identified various possible outcomes for the ego ideal, perverse as well as creative.\"\n\n"}

The Eris simulation is the first successful detailed simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy. The results of the simulation were announced in August 2011.\n\nSimulation projects intending to simulate spiral galaxies have been undertaken for the past 20 years. All of these projects had failed as the simulation results showed central bulges which are huge compared to the disk size.\n\nThe simulation was undertaken using supercomputers which include the Pleiades supercomputer, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and the supercomputers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The simulation used 1.4 million processor-hours of the Pleiades supercomputer.\n\nIt is based on the theory that in the early universe, cold and slow moving dark matter particles clumped together. These dark matter clumps then formed the \"scaffolding\" around galaxies and galactic clusters. The motions of more than 60 million particles which represented dark matter and galactic gas were simulated for a period of 13 billion years. The software platform \"Gasoline\" was used for the simulation.\n\nThe Eris simulation is the first successful simulation to have resolved the high-density gas clouds where stars formed. The simulation result consisted of a galaxy which is very similar to the Milky Way galaxy. Some of the parameters which were similar to Milky Way are stellar content, gas content, kinematic decomposition, brightness profile and the bulge-to-disk ratio.\n\nThe 60 million particles, which are used in the simulation, are not sufficient to simulate the 200 - 400 billion stars in the Milky Way.\n\n"}

As part of a \"Race War\", the player controls a neo-Nazi skinhead or a Klansman and is tasked with killing stereotypical African-American, Mexican, and Jewish enemies, ending with then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\n\nUsing the Genesis3D engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the Anti-Defamation League taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled \"White Law\", has been released.\n\n\"Ethnic Cleansing\" is a standard, short-length first-person shooter set in a single level. The player can select a neo-Nazi, a Skinhead, or a Klansman to control. They run through a ghetto that has been compared to New York City and shoot African-Americans and Mexicans, before descending into a subway system to kill Jews. Finally, the player reaches the \"Yiddish Control Center\", where a fictionalized version of Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel, is directing plans for world domination. He carries a rocket launcher; the player must kill him to complete the game. The heads-up display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.\n\nThe game's soundtrack consists of white power rock music. The game's art assets and sound effects feature racial stereotypes: when shot, black enemies make monkey noises and Jewish enemies are dressed as rabbis and shout \"oy vey!\". Mexican characters shout \"I need to take a siesta now\". In addition, black enemies are drawn to resemble apes and some wear T-shirts with the lettering \"NIGZ\", while Mexican enemies wear sombreros.\n\n\"Ethnic Cleansing\" was developed by members of the National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It was developed for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.\n\nShaun Walker, the chairman of the National Alliance, explained to the United Press that the intent was to produce a racially provocative video game and promote racial segregation. National Alliance founder William Luther Pierce, who also appears in the game to discuss an \"upcoming white revolution\", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 21) of 2002. It was priced at USD $14.88, a reference to the white supremacist Fourteen Words slogan and the neo-Nazi numerical code \"88\" (which stands for \"HH\" or \"Heil Hitler\").\n\nWhile it received little attention from the mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans on both sides of the political spectrum. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the Interactive Digital Software Association to encourage its members to adopt such policies.\n\nThe game's reception from critics was extremely negative. David Leonard of PopMatters described the game's graphics and \"playability\". While not approving of the game's message, he argued that it was only the latest in a long line of racist video games that included the likes of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", \"NFL Street\", and \"Freedom Fighters\". In January 2003, \"Stuff\" named \"Ethnic Cleansing\" the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only \"very stupid children\" would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like \"small-minded assholes\". \"Complex\" and \"UGO\" ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. \"UGO\" staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it \"profoundly stupid\".\n\nPierce estimated that \"a couple thousand\" copies of the game had been sold within a month of its release and that 90 percent of consumers had been white teenage boys.\n\nThe National Alliance and Resistance Records released a similar game, \"White Law\", in June 2003. It starred an Irish-American police officer taking up arms to protect his territory from racial minorities. It has been compared to \"Freedom Fighters\", though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel \"The Turner Diaries\". The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.\n\n"}

Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term \"hysteria\" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as somatization disorder. In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association officially changed the diagnosis of \"hysterical neurosis, conversion type\" to \"conversion disorder\".\n\nWhile the word \"hysteria\" originates from the Greek word for uterus, \"hystera\" (ὑστέρα), the word itself is not an ancient one, and the term \"hysterical suffocation\" – meaning a feeling of heat and inability to breathe, was instead used in ancient Greek medicine. This suggests an entirely physical cause for the symptoms but, by linking them to the uterus, suggests that the disorder can only be found in women. \n\nHistorically, hysteria was thought to manifest itself in women (female hysteria) with a variety of symptoms, including: anxiety, shortness of breath, fainting, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, as well as sexually forward behaviour. These symptoms mimic symptoms of other more definable diseases and create a case for arguing against the validity of hysteria as an actual disease, and it is often implied that it is an umbrella term for an indefinable illness. Through to the 20th century, however, the label hysteria was applied to a mental, rather than uterine or physical, affliction. Hysteria is no longer thought of as a real ailment.\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"hysteria\" connotes mass panic (mass hysteria). Hysteria was often associated with events such as the Salem witch trials, or slave revolt.\n\nThe term \"hysterical\", applied to an individual, can mean that he or she is emotional or irrationally upset; applied to a situation that does not involve panic, it means that situation is uncontrollably amusing (the connotation being that it invokes hysterical laughter).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38365576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38365576", "title": "Induction-recursion", "text": "Induction-recursion\n\nIn intuitionistic type theory (ITT), a discipline within mathematical logic, induction-recursion is a feature for simultaneously declaring a type and function on that type. It allows the creation of larger types, such as universes, than inductive types. The types created still remain predicative inside ITT.\n\nAn inductive definition is given by rules for generating elements of a type. One can then define functions from that type by induction on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-recursion generalizes this situation since one can \"simultaneously\" define the type and the function, because the rules for generating elements of the type are allowed to refer to the function.\n\nInduction-recursion can be used to define large types including various universe constructions. It increases the proof-theoretic strength of type theory substantially. Nevertheless, inductive-recursive recursive definitions are still considered predicative.\n\nInduction-Recursion came out of investigations to the rules of Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory. The type theory has a number of \"type formers\" and four kinds of rules for each one. Martin-Löf had hinted that the rules for each type former followed a pattern, which preserved the properties of the type theory (e.g., strong normalization, predicativity). Researchers started looking for the most general description of the pattern, since that would tell what kinds of type formers could be added (or not added!) to extend the type theory.\n\nThe \"universe\" type former was the most interesting, because when the rules were written \"à la Tarski\", they simultaneously defined the \"universe type\" \"and \"a function that operated on it. This eventually lead Dybjer to Induction-Recursion.\n\nDybjer's initial papers called Induction-Recursion a \"schema\" for rules. It stated what type formers could be added to the type theory. Later, he and Setzer would write a new type former with rules that allowed new Induction-Recursion definitions to be made inside the type theory. This was added to the Half proof assistant (a variant of Alf).\n\nBefore covering Inductive-Recursive types, the simpler case is Inductive Types. Constructors for Inductive types can be self-referential, but in a limited way. The constructor's parameters must be \"positive\": \n\nWith Inductive types, a parameter's type can depend on earlier parameters, but they cannot refer to ones of the type being defined. Inductive-Recursive types go further and parameter's types \"can\" refer to earlier parameters that use the type being defined. These must be \"half-positive\":\n\nSo, if formula_1 is the type being defined and formula_2 is the function being (simultaneously) defined, these parameter declarations are positive:\n\nThis is half-positive:\n\nThese are not positive nor half-positive:\n\nA simple common example is the Universe à la Tarski type former. It creates a type formula_23 and a function formula_24. There is an element of formula_23 for every type in the type theory (except formula_23 itself!). The function formula_24 maps the elements of formula_23 to the associated type.\n\nThe type formula_23 has a constructor (or introduction rule) for each type former in the type theory. The one for dependent functions would be:\n\nformula_30\n\nThat is, it takes an element formula_31 of type formula_23 that will map to the type of the parameter and an element formula_33 that will map to the return type of the function (which is dependent on the value of the parameter). (The final formula_34 says that the result of the constructor is an element of type formula_23.)\n\nThe reduction (or computation rule) says that\n\nformula_36 becomes formula_37\n\nAfter reduction, the function formula_24 is operating on a smaller part of the input. If that holds when formula_24 is applied to any constructor, then formula_24 will always terminate. Without going into the details, Induction-Recursion states what kinds of definitions (or rules) can be added to the theory such that the function calls will always terminate.\n\nInduction-Recursion is implemented in Agda and Idris.\n\n\n"}

Folk\n\nJoseph \"Holy Joe\" Wingate Folk (October 28, 1869 – May 28, 1923) was an American lawyer, reformer, and politician from St. Louis, Missouri. He was Governor of Missouri from 1905 to 1909.\n\nJoseph Folk was born in Brownsville, Tennessee to Henry Bate and Martha Estes Folk and raised in a strict Baptist household. His early education was completed at Brownsville Academy, after which he worked for several companies in Memphis, Tennessee as a clerk and bookkeeper. Folk studied law and graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1890. He joined his father's law firm and focused on criminal law.\n\nEarly in his career, Folk ran for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1892, wrote newspaper articles, spoke on special occasions, and joined the Knights of Pythias. In 1893, he moved to St. Louis to join his uncle's law practice. Folk married Gertrude Glass on November 10, 1896. He helped to organize the Jefferson Club, a local young Democrats' organization, and acted as the group's president in 1898–1899.\n\nFolk made his reputation as a lawyer for transit workers in the St. Louis Streetcar Strike of 1900. His work as mediator earned him a Democratic nomination for circuit attorney in 1900, and he won the election against Judge Eugene Mcquillen.\n\nFolk earned his nickname by attacking local corruption and party machines. With the assistance of Lincoln Steffens's articles published in \"McClure's\" magazine, Folk led investigations of the city's Democratic boss, Col. Ed Butler and the corrupt \"boodle ring\" of corporate bribery in the state and municipal government. Although some of the convictions Folk obtained were overturned on appeal, his work had national and international consequences. Folk gained the respect of Republican President Theodore Roosevelt as he and other crusading prosecutors and muckraking journalists brought national attention to municipal corruption. Folk's prosecution of the Suburban Railway Company stimulated a change in US treaties with Mexico to include bribery as grounds for extradition. As district attorney, Folk encountered opposition from many businessmen and politicians, who believed that his exposing corrupt practices hurt the city's reputation, and thus the Democratic party as well as the business climate.\n\nFolk was elected the 31st Governor of Missouri as a progressive reformer and Democrat in the 1904 election. In the governor's office, he advocated the \"Missouri Idea\", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement. His administration found initial success despite opposition and successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended gratis railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statues, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal, and enforced the Sunday-closing law. The latter half of Folk's gubernatorial term found a Democratically controlled General Assembly, in large part due to Folk's reforms. The governor was able to enact further legislation, including an initiative and referendum amendment to the Constitution of Missouri, and further regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities. A number of examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk's administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission.\n\nFollowing his gubernatorial term, Folk's focus on morality and unwillingness to compromise eventually made him politically unpopular, and his initial attempts for a senate nomination were unsuccessful. He returned to law practice, toured as a Chautauqua speaker, and campaigned for Woodrow Wilson. Wilson appointed Folk as a solicitor for the US State Department, where he investigated major railroad companies. In 1918, he was able to win a Democratic nomination for the US Senate, but lost in the election. After a brief stint at the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, Folk opened a private law office in Washington, D.C. He arbitrated in several international negotiations.\n\nFolk experienced a nervous breakdown in March 1922, believed to be from overwork. He died aged 54 in 1923 in New York City, and is buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Brownsville, Tennessee.\n\nHis Washington D.C. residence is now the Embassy of Mauritania. A 1943 Liberty ship was named in his honor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1769189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1769189", "title": "Justice (virtue)", "text": "Justice (virtue)\n\nJustice is one of the four cardinal virtues in classical European philosophy and Roman Catholicism. It is the moderation or mean between selfishness and selflessness – between having more and having less than one's fair share.\n\nJustice is closely related, in Christianity, to the practice of Charity (virtue) because it regulates the relationships with others. It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is \"pivotal\", because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, \"Justice consists in a certain equality by which the just and definite claim of another, neither more nor less, is satisfied.\"\n\nThis is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights: two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other. Aristotle developed the idea of equity to cover irregular cases so that \"the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances\".\n\nMacrobius saw Justice as existing on four different planes or levels, rising from the everyday political virtue at the lowest to the Archetypal Form of Justice at the highest.\n\nThe just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor. In Colossians 4:1 St. Paul counsels \"Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, realizing that you too have a Master in heaven.\" \nIn Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable.\n\nIn Aristotle's wake, Thomas Aquinas developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their moral and legal rights to do, possess, or exact. Justice toward God is called the \"virtue of religion\".\n\nWith the late modern rise in interest in virtue ethics, a new interest in articulating the virtue of justice has emerged. John Rawls saw justice as the typical virtue of the institution; Irene van Staveren saw it as that of the state, marked by such indicators as votes, legitimacy, public fairness and distributive rules.\n\nMoral justice has been linked to the sixth and highest of Kohlberg's stages of moral development.\n\nFreudians consider that in the unconscious the image of the Father embodies a stern but fair justice; Jungians similarly see the archetype of the King as representing the right ordering of society.\n\nDante made Justice the virtue of his sixth heaven (the sphere of Jupiter), and illustrated it through such martial figures as Joshua and Roland.\n\nSir Philip Sydney wrote of \"justice the chief of virtues\"; Edmund Spenser devoted the fifth book of \"The Faerie Queene\" to the same theme.\n\nWallace Stevens rejected what he called \"galled Justicia/Trained to poise the tables of the law\" as part of the obsolete images of the past, and favoured instead the modernist seeking out of new ruling images – new \"sovereigns of the soul\".\n\n"}

Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets. \n\nKnowledge spaces were introduced in 1985 by Jean-Paul Doignon and Jean-Claude Falmagne and have since been studied by many other researchers. They also form the basis for two computerized tutoring systems, RATH (defunct now) and ALEKS.\n\nIt is possible to interpret a knowledge space as a special form of a restricted latent class model.\n\nKnowledge Space Theory (KST) was motivated by the shortcomings of the psychometric approach to the assessment of competence like SAT and ACT.

The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions.\n\nAnother method is to construct the knowledge space by explorative data analysis (for example by Item tree analysis) from data.\nA third method is to derive the knowledge space from an analysis of the problem solving processes in the corresponding domain.\n"}

{"id": "20723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20723", "title": "M'Naghten rules", "text": "M'Naghten rules\n\nThe M'Naghten rule (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, McNaughton) is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a criminal case when there is a defense of insanity: \nThe rule was formulated as a reaction to the acquittal in 1843 of Daniel M'Naghten on the charge of murdering Edward Drummond, whom M'Naghten had mistaken for British Prime Minister Robert Peel. M'Naghten fired a pistol at the back of Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, who died five days later. The House of Lords asked a panel of judges, presided over by Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a series of hypothetical questions about the defence of insanity. The principles expounded by this panel have come to be known as the \"M'Naghten Rules\", though they have gained any status only by usage in the common law and M'Naghten himself would have been found guilty if they had been applied at his trial. \n\nThe rules so formulated as \"M'Naghten's Case\" 1843 10 C & F 200 have been a standard test for criminal liability in relation to mentally disordered defendants in common law jurisdictions ever since, with some minor adjustments. When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" or \"guilty but insane\" and the sentence may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the court (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal.\n\nThe insanity defence is recognized in Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, India, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and most U.S. states with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont but not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules.\n\nThere are various justifications for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a defence in a criminal trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies public policies in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of compassion, accepting that it is morally wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that the definition of a crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A utilitarian and humanitarian approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.\n\nHistorically, insanity was seen as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code – a murderer could pay compensation to the victim's family under the principle of \"buy off the spear or bear it\". The insane person's family were expected to pay any compensation and look after. In Norman times insanity was not seen as a defence in itself but a special circumstance in which the jury would deliver a guilty verdict and refer the defendant to the King for a pardon\n\nIn \"R v Arnold\" 1724 16 How St. Tr. 765, the test for insanity was expressed in the following terms\n\nwhether the accused is totally deprived of his understanding and memory and knew what he was doing \"no more than a wild beast or a brute, or an infant\".\n\nThe next major advance occurred in \"Hadfield's Trial\" 1800 27 How St. Tr. 765 in which the court decided that a crime committed under some delusion would be excused only if it would have been excusable had the delusion been true. This would deal with the situation, for example, when the accused imagines he is cutting through a loaf of bread, whereas in fact he is cutting through a person's neck.\n\nEach jurisdiction may have its own standards of the insanity defense. More than one standard can be applied to any case based on multiple jurisdictions.\n\nThe House of Lords delivered the following exposition of the Rules:\n\nThe central issue of this definition may be stated as \"did the defendant know what they were doing, or, if so, that it was wrong?\", and the issues raised have been analysed in subsequent appellate decisions:\n\nSanity is a rebuttable presumption and the burden of proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in \"Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland\" 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence will be more likely to raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In \"R v Clarke\" 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no \"mens rea\" because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.\n\nWhether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the Rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation. It seems that any disease which produces a malfunctioning of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain itself. The term has been held to cover numerous conditions:\nThe courts have clearly drawn a distinction between internal and external factors affecting a defendant's mental condition. This is partly based on risk of recurrence, whereby the High Court of Australia has expressed that the defence of automatism is unable considered when the mental disorder has been proved transient and as such not likely to recur. However, the distinction between insanity and automatism is difficult because the distinction between internal and external divide is difficult. Many diseases consist of a predisposition, considered an internal cause, combined with a precipitant, which would be considered an external cause. Actions committed while sleepwalking would normally be considered as \"non-insane automatism\", but often alcohol and stress trigger bouts of sleepwalking and make them more likely to be violent. The diabetic who takes insulin but does not eat properly – is that an internal or external cause?\n\nThis phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act, rather than the moral quality. It covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing. Two common examples used are:\nThe judges were specifically asked if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, \"he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real\". This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows \"Hadfield's Trial\", above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. In \"R v Bell\" 1984 Crim. LR 685 the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because \"It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it\" as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, and the fact that he believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense.\n\nThe interpretation of this clause is a subject of controversy among legal authorities, and different standards may apply in different jurisdictions.\n\n\"Wrong\" was interpreted to mean \"legally\" wrong, rather than \"morally\" wrong, in the case of \"Windle\" 1952 2QB 826; 1952 2 All ER 1 246, where the defendant killed his wife with an overdose of aspirin; he telephoned the police and said, \"I suppose they will hang me for this.\" It was held that this was sufficient to show that although the defendant was suffering from a mental illness, he was aware that his act was wrong, and the defense was not allowed. Under this interpretation, there may be cases where the mentally ill know that their conduct is legally prohibited, but it is arguable that their mental condition prevents them making the connection between an act being legally prohibited and the societal requirement to conform their conduct to the requirements of the criminal law.\n\nAs an example of a contrasting interpretation in which defendant lacking knowledge that the act was \"morally\" wrong meets the M'Naghten standards, there are the instructions the judge is required to provide to the jury in cases in New York State when the defendant has raised an insanity plea as a defense:\n... with respect to the term \"wrong\", a person lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate that conduct is wrong if that person, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either that the conduct was against the law or that it was against commonly held moral principles, or both.\nThere is other support in the authorities for this interpretation of the standards enunciated in the findings presented to the House of Lords regarding M'Naghten's case:\nIf it be accepted, as can hardly be denied, that the answers of the judges to the questions asked by the House of Lords in 1843 are to be read in the light of the then existing case-law and not as novel pronouncements of a legislative character, then the [Australian] High Court's analysis in \"Stapleton's Case\" is compelling. Their exhaustive examination of the extensive case-law concerning the defense of insanity prior to and at the time of the trial of M'Naughten establishes convincingly that it was morality and not legality which lay as a concept behind the judges' use of \"wrong\" in the M'Naghten rules.\nIn \"DPP v Harper\" (1997) it was held that insanity is not generally a defense to strict liability offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol. By definition, the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the \"actus reus\" of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong. Any other feature of the accused's knowledge is irrelevant.\n\nSection 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that \"the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity\" except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder. This may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do, but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, justify the jury in coming to that conclusion.\n\nUnder section 3 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991:\n\nThere have been four major criticisms of the law as it currently stands:\n\nThe insanity defense article has a number of alternative tests that have been used at different times and places. As one example, the ALI test replaced the M'Naughten rule in many parts of the United States for many years until the 1980s; when in the aftermath of John Hinckley shooting President Ronald Reagan many ALI states returned to a variation of M'Naughten.\n\nThe M'Naghten rules are at the focus of John Grisham's legal thriller \"Time to Kill\". The M'Naghten rules apply in the US State of Mississippi, where the plot is set, and using them is the only way for the lawyer protagonist to save his client.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8369895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8369895", "title": "Mircea Florian (musician)", "text": "Mircea Florian (musician)\n\nMircea Florian (, also known as Florian din Transilvania, M. A. N. Florian, FloriMAN; born December 5, 1949), is a Romanian multi-instrumentalist musician, multimedia artist and computer scientist, based in Germany. Having started his musical career as a folk rock singer, in the late 1960s, he developed a fusion between Romanian folklore and Eastern music, especially Indian sound, moving into psychedelic music. He founded \"Ceata Melopoică\" ensemble, with whom he recorded a concept album. These and his solo acts earned him a cult following among rebellious youth, establishing his reputation as one of the most original contributors to Romanian pop music. Florian was also an early member of \"Cenaclul Flacăra\", a traveling music and literature circle, but parted with it when it became increasingly nationalistic.\n\nBefore 1980, Florian was turning his attention to electronic music and new wave. In parallel, like other artists on the Romanian folk scene, he was pursuing his interest in non-pop ventures, from experimental rock and minimal music to biomusic, and exhibiting his installation art. In 1986, Florian escaped Communist Romania, having by then been exposed to much communist censorship, and took up cultural and scientific projects in West Germany. Since the Romanian Revolution, he has made frequent returns, playing at numerous festivals and composing film scores.\n\nBorn in Satu Mare, Mircea Florian began his musical education as a pianist and saxophonist, before turning to guitar, blockflute, mandolin and various other instruments. He first took classes at the Satu Mare Art School, and first became interested in performing arts while an avid spectator of the local \"Medrano\" Circus (the place where he also witnessed the first concert by a rock band).\n\nFlorian then studied at the Eminescu High School, where he had musical appearances with the band \"Zburătorii\" (1965). A while after, he also gave his first one-man show, which included a dance routine. In parallel to state-run education, he took private courses in music and visual arts. Florian first came into contact with the burgeoning hippie movement of the West, and met Romanians who, despite facing tight scrutiny from the communist authorities, wanted to replicate it locally. In 2005, he stated that the fundamental difference was in the drug culture, which Romanians had little access to, adding: \"In any case the manner in which the artistic act was supposed to be carried out here was different from what one could experience in the West. Romanian artists created for a tighter circle, of (proper) connoisseurs.\" Elsewhere, he also noted that hippie culture was essentially becoming more accessible to Romanians by the end of the 1960s: \"I remember that, once a record came out, fresh off the Western market, no more than a week would pass before it got to Romania, brought over by some sailor or an acquaintance who had been visiting 'out on the outside', or through heaven knows what channels...\"\n\nAmong the decade's pop acts, Florian was most impressed by Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Leonard Cohen. At the time, he became an avid listener of clandestine Western radio, where he first heard the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen, Steve Reich and especially Luigi Nono: \"Nono's music was so new, so captivating, so rich in meanings... I got hooked on it forever!\" He carried out his first experiments with electronic music at the age of 16, when, in his search for new \"tone colors\", he turned a sound generator into a keyboard instrument.\n\n\"Zburătorii\" disbanded in 1967, and Florian left Satu Mare for Bucharest, the capital. He studied cybernetics at the Politehnica University, from 1967 to 1972, and was part of the first-ever graduating class at Politehnica's Faculty of Economic Calculations. After arriving in Bucharest, he played for a while with a band called \"Lotus\", which, he recalls, was a \"pretty interesting\" folk project. In 1968, during the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Florian also had his first brush-in with communist censorship: a song of his, which was transparently critical of the Soviet Union, was banned from public radio. According to popular account, DJ Cornel Chiriac ignored such commands and played the song, being promptly sacked as a result (the other version attributes his dismissal to having played The Beatles' ambiguous record \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\").\n\n\"Lotus\" major breakthrough came in 1969, when they performed at the \"3-Gaură-3\" Club, where music critic Florin Silviu Ursulescu organized Romania's first American folk-inspired music festival. As noted by Florian, \"Lotus\" appeared alongside the \"first wave\" of Romanian folk singers, among them Mircea Vintilă, Dorin Liviu Zaharia and Doru Stănculescu. At around the same time, Florian joined the \"Luceafărul\" literary club, and provided the avant-garde jazz background to the Surrealistic poems recited live by Valery Oisteanu.\n\nIn parallel, Florian's work in mathematics opened new fields for his musical experimentation. The major factor, he notes, was his familiarization with transistor computers at the Economic Calculations laboratory and the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, during an era of \"sheer luck\"—that is, when liberalization allowed Romania to trade in electronics with the United States. He had a free hand to work in algorithmic composition and computer music. He was officially employed by the computer industry from age 22, supplementing his salary with semi-compulsory dispatches \"on location\", which allowed him to invest his own money in various cutting-edge musical instruments.\n\nBy 1971, Mircea Florian had grown dissatisfied with the band concept, and committed himself mainly to solo projects. As such, in what he calls his \"white period\" of acoustic rock, he notably became the opening act for the celebrated rock band Transsylvania Phoenix. He also played at the Ion Mincu University hangout, \"Club A\", in live concerts with Vintilă and actor-singer Florian Pittiş. The coincidence of names with the latter was a running joke, and it was here that he began using the stage name \"Florian din Transilvania\" (literally, \"Florian from Transylvania\"). It has endured as one of the singer's main pseudonyms, alongside \"M. A. N. Florian\".\n\nHis focus was on playing string instruments such as guitar or \"cobza\", as well as being a singer-songwriter. He established a concept-band, known initially as \"Florian în Labirint\" (\"Florian in the Labyrinth\"), and later as \"Ceata de dubaşi, ceteraşi, kitarozi şi alţi meşteri lăutari\" (\"A Band of Drummers, Cittern-players, Guitarists and Other Master \"Lăutari\"\"), and also involving Gabi Căciulă and Sorin Chifiriuc as guitarists and Alexandru Beno as violinist. The project broke musical ground when it added Indian influences and sitar backing, which was contributed by Ljubiša Ristić, of Yugoslavia. The occasional tabla rhythm and flute melodies were played by a Pakistani performer, Arif Djafri.\n\nThe music was described by Florian as combining \"archaic and electric elements\" into \"a science\", and covering successive colored \"periods\" in his creative history, when he was into amassing musical instruments. The new Western inspirations on his work were Laurie Anderson, Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren. Emerging from the core group of \"Florian în Labirint\", \"Ceata Melopoică\" (\"The Melo-poetic Band\") became Florian's main project of the 1970s. Its often-changing membership included: Beno, Căciulă, Chifiriuc, Ristić, Zaharia, Andrei Oişteanu, Alexandru Beno, Valentin Andronescu, Günther Reininger, Andrei Cristea, Eugen Gondi, Dietrich Krauser, Mihai Creţu, Costin Petrescu, Alexandru Mitaru, Alexe Conta, Mircea Dordoi, Ortansa Păun, Sorin Baroţi, Gheorghe Popescu and Mihai Pintilie.\n\nFrom its choice of name, this new project also reflected its leader's mounting interest in Ancient Greek philosophy, the ideological source of his psych-folk, which he describes as more profound than generic folk rock. He referred to his earlier folk songs as \"singable\" and \"more accessible\" than his later work. Although psychedelic music was not well seen in Communist Romania in the 1970s, Florian's psych-folk earned a cult following. According to critic Mihai Plămădeală, there was a transition at the end of which Florian became \"one of the most peculiar Romanian musicians\": \"While he started his career as a folk-singer, with several calm and usual songs, Florian slowly began to get distance from standard means of expression.\"\n\nThere was a political aspect to Florian's reputation. He later spoke about the cultural shock at the end of liberalization, when the \"July Theses\" introduced Sino-North Korean-style state control. As noted by critic Marius Chivu, Florian's opposition to the communist regime led him into \"the great quad of folk protest singers\", with Nicu Vladimir, Valeriu Sterian and Horia Stoicanu. For a while, he was a presence at \"Cenaclul Flacăra\", the folk-singing club organized with communist approval. The singer later stated that he was one of the club's founding members, together with poet Adrian Păunescu, his colleague at \"Luceafărul\", and that he intended to create \"a movement to bring together people interested in poetry and music.\"\n\nIn the end, Florian was thrown out for performing songs punctuated with double entendres. Literary critic and folk music fan Dan C. Mihăilescu suggests that these disagreements reflected a larger cultural conflict. He describes Florian, Marcela Saftiuc, Sterian and Zaharia as fundamentally different from the \"Maoist\" agenda of Romanian communism, and notes that they also became irreconcilable with Păunescu when the latter committed himself to \"embarrassing\" indoctrination. Reflecting back on his childhood attendance of \"Cenaclul\", writer-politician Varujan Vosganian noted a similar issue: \"I liked Marcela Saftiuc, [...] Mircea Florian, Doru Stănculescu and many others, I did not like it when we were made to stand up clapping and chanting.\" As asserted by literary critic Ion Bogdan Lefter, \"Few authentic artists of the [folk] genre could prevent its rapid absorption into the melodious, lyricaloid and often jingoistic kitsch promoted by the propagandistic \"Cenaclul Flacăra\".\" Florian's account mentions the \"controlled diversions\" of such ventures, adding that the \"real folk\" of the 1970s was lost to indoctrination and commercialization.\n\nFlorian recalls that his lyrics, and especially his long-haired looks, were a growing cause for irritation among communist censors, and that as a consequence he devised various \"strategies\" for getting his message across to the public. He also explained: \"In general the text that was very trenchant stood no chance—they would pick you up then and there and out you were [...]. But everybody would metaphorize. One would get what it was all about from the text, but the most important bit was the state of mind, the attitude sent out by the author, by the artist... [...] Very often [my] message was a simple one: I refused enrollment, I refused that social formula, I would not let myself be lied to and I would let the public know that, I called for 'general cleanup' actions, I also expressed my position on the fact that freedom had been taken away from me. That was fundamental.\"\n\nFlorian and Zaharia had a friendly relationship with writer Dorin Tudoran, who was in the process of becoming an outspoken dissident. According to Tudoran, it was around 1974 when the three of them first became aware that agents of the Securitate secret police were keeping them under surveillance. \"Ceata\" member Andrei Oişteanu, who made his career in religious studies, also noted that the Securitate was at the time closing in on himself and other non-conformists or hippies.\n\nFlorian's solo music was included on the 1973 split EP \"Muzică folk\" (\"Folk Music\"), which he shared with Saftiuc, then, in 1975, on the single \"Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint\" (\"Quieting Forest/At the Stone Tavern/With the Silver Eyelid\"). The songs, recorded with Chifiriuc, Reininger and Căciulă, were based on texts written by Florian or selected from Romanian folklore, particularly hajduk songs. The instrumental arrangement comprised a wide assortment of instruments: acoustic guitar, flute, drum kit, \"cobza\", jaw harp, idiophones (all played by Florian himself), alongside electric guitar, tabla, conga, electric piano, celesta, synthesizer and electronic organ. Mihai Plămădeală describes the result as a unique project in Romanian music: \"Nothing of what can be listened to or heard on it finds a direct correspondent in anything that anyone, anywhere, has achieved.\" He notes Florian's fusion of \"hippie culture\", \"mantra\" singing and the \"maximal liberty of progressive rock\". Reputedly, Florian remains the first Romanian singer to have employed the synthesizer in one of their works.\n\nFlorian continued with live performances, including the concert of Orăştioara de Sus, where he went on stage alongside Transsylvania Phoenix and the traditionalist drumming band of Brăneşti, performing what Florian calls \"unfiltered, clean, unprocessed music.\" Like Nicu Vladimir, he gave concerts at the \"fires on the beach\" gatherings in the remote Black Sea resort of 2 Mai, a hippie hotspot, before such events were altogether banned on grounds of border security. He also provided the music to Oişteanu's play \"Vlacea, regele nebun\" (\"Mad King Vlacea\"), performed on tour by the Ţăndărică Theater, and reportedly poking fun at the authoritarian leader Nicolae Ceauşescu. Florian later made an appearance as actor-pupeteer and multi-instrumentalist performer in \"Till Eulenspiegel\", directed by Cătălina Buzoianu for Ţăndărică. As he recalls, this involved him playing some 30 or 40 instruments in quick succession, from celesta, sackbut and melodica to guitar; Florian does not consider himself a consummate player of all such instruments: \"it's like painting and needing some yellow just for a tiny highlight. You can't say you've painted in yellow.\"\n\n\"Pădure...\" was followed in 1977 by another single, \"Fîntîna\" (\"The Well\"). An electronic rock product, it included a collaboration with rock drummer Radu Răducanu. In 1979, Florian was included on a compilation album, also titled \"Muzică folk\". However, most of the music he composed and produced at that stage went unrecorded, or was only preserved on fidelipac. As noted by his former promoter Florin Silviu Ursulescu, who was working for the Radio Company, his supervisors had simply banned some of Florian's songs for containing what they called \"inane lyrics\".\n\nOver the following period, Florian became more interested in electronic music, familiarizing himself with new technologies while working as an engineer for the Computer Science Institute, Bucharest. He also had access to the recordings kept in the Radu Stan collection at the State Central Library. According to his own reference system, this inaugurated a \"green period\". Beyond the early pop influences, Florian was increasingly inspired by the classics of electronic, aleatoric or minimal music: Léon Theremin, Pierre Schaeffer, Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Morton Subotnick, Lejaren Hiller, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Iannis Xenakis, John Cage.\n\nWith collaborators Belu Alexandru and Valentin Antonescu, he tested minimalist recordings on magnetic tape, glued into various sequences. Florian also composed and, with the help of Transsylvania Phoenix drummer Costin Petrescu, recorded the experimental rock song \"Nicodim şi toaca ascunsă\" (\"Nicodim and the Hidden Semantron\"), which was visually supported by Florian's performance art and reworked on a music sequencer. The musical pieces were played at Florian's exhibits, including his contribution to the major multimaedia show \"Scrierea\" (\"Writing\"), or in special \"new music\" concerts held in classical concert halls such as the Romanian Atheneum. His other activity as a multimedia artist was in biomusic: in 1976, Kalinderu Palace hosted his live study, \"Corpul uman\" (\"The Human Body\"), during which he mixed the body resonance of one friend into a musical arrangement.\n\nIn reference to this phase, Lefter includes Florian among the young men who reached out of the folk and hippie scenes and into the field of multimedia experiments, in what was largely an attempt to circumvent the official art of communism. This \"pre-postmodern\" transition, Lefter notes, was also affected by the Sfinx, Transsylvania Phoenix, \"the weird\" Dorin Zaharia and Nicu Vladimir, but Florian's work remained the \"most interesting\". Florian, who first began introducing himself as an \"InterMedia artist\" during the 1970s, collaborated with draftsman Anton Petraşincu, who created the first opaque projections to go with Florian's live singing.\n\nBy 1977, Florian's interest in electronic musical instruments, particularly synthesizers, created splits within \"Ceata Melopoică\", which was also affected by some of its members' decisions to emigrate. In the early 1980s, Florian was again interested in setting up a classic rock band, but also sought to preserve the trademark combination of folklore and electronics. He switched to new wave music, with his new band \"Florian din Transilvania\"; among his new wave and electronic influences, Florian called to mind David Byrne, Brian Eno and Depeche Mode. Reflecting back on this time, he spoke of Sfinx's Dan Andrei Aldea as the \"saint\" of Romanian electronic music, one \"more important than anyone else\" on this scene.\n\nThe group only released one album, the 1986 vinyl-edition \"Tainicul vîrtej\" (\"The Secret Swirl\"), with the state-run recording company Electrecord. The lyricist and composer Florian did most of the vocals, and played \"cobza\", guitar and synthesizer. The other members of the team came from various Romanian rock and pop acts: Andronescu was on keyboards, Doru Căplescu on additional synthesizer, Dan Cimpoieru on second guitar, Doru Istudor on drums, Zsolt Kerestely on electronic drums, with Mircea Baniciu providing backing vocals and Mihaela Hoaja the violin parts. Reportedly, the record went through the hands of official censors before being released, and Florian's song \"Madama Butterfly\" had to be discarded, leaving space for other songs such as \"Nunta lui Harap Alb\" (\"Harap Alb's Wedding\"). The song \"AS\" (\"Ace\"), also included on the album, was altogether banned after the Electrecord producers picked up on its political hints.\n\nPlămădeală argues that \"Tainicul vîrtej\" follows its composer's \"metaphysical\" inclination, being notable for its \"shock element\", while journalist and musician Maria Balabaş describes the record as \"psychedelic\" with an \"electronic sound\". According to its author, it should also be seen as \"intellectualized\" and \"elitist\", but not in fact a \"hiatus\" in his artistic development. Florian additionally argued that, from \"stupor\", the public's reaction to his compositions became \"very positive, even enthusiastic.\"\n\nAlthough short-lived, the act became known on the underground scene for both its music and the conceptual art of its live performances, drawing comparisons with Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh and the Third Ear Band; during such events, Florian would appear dressed up in a hazmat suit. Florian and his collaborators toured the country, and were awarded the first prize at the \"Constelaţii rock\" event in Râmnicu Vâlcea. \"Tainicul vîrtej\" also led to shows at various underground venues, from Stelian Tănase's rock evenings at the Revue Theater to the State Jewish Theater stage and Arenele Romane.\n\nThe artist was several times invited to exhibit his work outside Romania, and even beyond the Iron Curtain, receiving a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service and attending the \"Darmstädter Ferienkurse\", where he worked under Stockhausen's supervision. In 1982, he was among those collaborating with the \"Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk\" studio of electronic music, in Cologne. His concerts abroad were probably the reason why his \"Tainicul vîrtej\" was never on general release: the communist government allegedly presumed that he would not be returning, and tried to prevent the public from glorifying his departure. Florian accuses Electrecord of having mismanaged the distribution, by not printing sufficient copies and by oversupplying shops located outside Bucharest.\n\nMircea Florian continued his work in other media, joining with the \"SubReal\" performance artists, with whom he staged a 1986 event in the city of Sibiu. He notes having been increasingly frustrated by censorship, which prevented him from participating in some exhibits and concerts, and eventually pondering about leaving the country.\n\nAfter receiving a visa for the United States, where he had been invited to present his sound installations, he defected and later settled down in West Germany. He changed residence between the cities of North Rhine-Westphalia: Mettmann, Wuppertal, Düsseldorf. He decided not to work as a musician, because he could only conceive of singing in his native Romanian language.\n\nFlorian focused on his work as an artist and computer scientist. Since the late 1980s he has been combining visual arts with music to create sound sculptures, sound installations, and collages. By 2009, his work had received some 21 awards, including, alongside Romanian ones, German, British and Japanese distinctions. He was present with his work at the Venice Biennale of 1999, and managed a Romanian festival in Wuppertal.\n\nIn the decades after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Florian has resumed his collaboration with Romanian artists, including Nicu Covaci: in 1992, he wrote the title song on Covaci's \"Symphoenix\" album \"Timişoara\". Also in 1992, he participated in setting up \"Deutsch-Rumänische Kulturbegegnungen\" (\"German-Romanian Cultural Encounters\", or DeR KuB), a cultural society dedicated to cooperation between artists; its Romanian branch is the \"Mircea Florian Association\". Two years later, some of his work was reissued on the \"Club A\" compilation. Florian also contributed the preface to Vlad Arghir's book, the first Romanian-language monograph on Leonard Cohen, published in Hungary by Pont Kiadó.\n\nFlorian and DeR KuB have organized several events reuniting Romanian folkloric ensembles from Hungary, Serbia and Ukraine with bands representing the various traditions of minority groups in Romania. He personally spent a week in Satu Mare Prison, coaching the detainees' own musical project, and created portrait projection shows in Satu Mare and Bratislava. In addition to opening for Phoenix and Covaci at reunion concerts in 2003, Florian has performed with the Shukar Collective project, which mixes electronic music with Romani tradition. He and Shukar's DJ Vasile remixed several \"Ursari\" renditions of old songs, \"some five out of eleven\" entries on the Collective's album, and including the single \"Anna e Manole\". He intended to continue work with this group, but it disbanded following lead singer Tamango's illness.\n\nFlorian's performance art was showcased in exhibits at the National Theater Bucharest, the International Center for Contemporary Art, the Cluj-Napoca Technical College etc. In addition, he was visiting scholar at the Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography and Babeş-Bolyai University. Florian was also invited to sing at the \"Stufstock\" event of Vama Veche, in 2004, but refused to perform on stage, and gave an impromptu concert on one of the side alleys, in hopes of addressing only his real fans. Florian was later a guest at \"Festivalul Plai\", a multicultural music event held in Timişoara city. He also returned to attend the Gărâna Jazz Festival, and tried to set up his own world music festival project, in Certeze. His presences at \"Folk You!\" in Vama Veche were included on the festival's \"best of\" compilation for 2007. In January 2008, after polling the Romanian music critics, \"Sunete\" magazine ranked Florian the 11th most important musician in the country's pop history.\n\nFlorian composed the musical score to Ioan Cărmăzan's drama film \"Margo\" (2006).<ref name=\"agunul/an\"> Andrei Gorzo, \"Unul pe an\", in \"Dilema Veche\", Nr. 137, September 2006</ref> Like the film itself, his contribution received strong criticism from film critic Andrei Gorzo: \"Margo travels a lot by train, then walks even more, [...] forever accompanied by the chirps, electronic farts and spaghetti western ding-dongs in Mircea Florian's music.\" Florian was later the composer of music for Alexandru Solomon's political documentary \"\" (2010). It was received with interest by film journalist Mihai Fulger, who described Solomon as a \"trendsetter\", for attaching Florian's original music to animation and archive footage. Florian's contribution was nominated for the Gopo Awards of 2011, in the \"Best Original Music in Short Film\" category.\n\nHe was additionally working with Cătălina Buzoianu, arranging the music to her various productions, including a 2005 version of August Strindberg's \"Father\" and a 2008 staging of Mircea Cărtărescu's \"Dream\". Theater manager and poet Ion Cocora was impressed by the latter show and its \"fairy tale state\", describing Florian's music as \"a continuous oscillation between the real and the unreal.\" Theater critic Alice Georgescu also described Florian's music for \"Dream\" as \"felicitously reusing childish rhymes\". The collaborative project was later taken up for the 2009 productions of Matei Vişniec's \"Joan and the Fire\" and \"We're Banning Richard III\" (Bulandra Theater), as well as to the 2010 adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's \"The Magician of Lublin\" (State Jewish Theater).\n\nAround 2007, Florian's work in art again centered on magnetic tape, used in collages and sound sculptures. One example is his work \"The Last Supper\", exhibited in Berlin: it is a combination of three analog recordings, on different colors of tape, played in unison. His work in Romania covered graphic art, and he designed the layout to the cultural review \"aLtitudini\". Some of his other projects again bridged avant-garde jazz and literature. Around 2004, he toured with novelist Gheorghe Crăciun, who was promoting his book \"Pupa Russa\". In 2010, he resumed his work with Valery Oisteanu, upon the latter's return from the United States. Their mix of Surrealism and electronic music was hosted by the \"Green Hours\" pub, in Bucharest.\n\nWhile experimenting with a new generation of electronica gear (samplers, Ableton Live and Max programs, Korg adapters etc.), Florian still saw string instruments as his first love, and noted that he had also begun playing the guitalele. In February 2011, Florian, DJ Vasile and their new music project, \"FloriMan\", performed live at the \"Cinema Total\", part of the Berlinale festivities. During this, they mixed electronic music and traditional \"bucium\"-playing. His past work was also included in the Berlin exhibit \"When History Comes Knocking: Romanian Art from the 80s and 90s in Close Up\".\n\nIn June, the Vasile Goldiş West University made Florian an \"honoris causa\" doctor. The same year, he returned to Romania with a re-release of \"Tainicul vîrtej\" as a Bucharest musical show, part of the Club A Festival, and a personal exhibit at the Bucharest Municipal Art Galleries, \"Negrele-mi aripi\" (\"Black My Wings\"), turned into a film directed by fellow artist Victor Velculescu. It recorded Florian's installations, which comprised brushes, a laptop, an oscilloscope and other instruments, creating the illusion of a winged figure attached to his body. Also in 2011, the alternative rock act byron covered one of his \"Tainicul vîrtej\" songs on their own album \"Perfect\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1535899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1535899", "title": "Miyabi", "text": "Miyabi\n\nMiyabi (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as Iki or Wabi-sabi. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as \"elegance,\" \"refinement,\" or \"courtliness\" and sometimes to a \"sweet loved one\".\n\nThe ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the \"polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace.\" It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the Heian era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of Mono no aware, a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.\n\nAdherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the Man'yōshū, the oldest extant collection of Japanese poetry. The Man'yōshū contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this. Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.\n\nMiyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by Zen Buddhism, such as Wabi-sabi, Yuugen and Iki.\n\nThe characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel \"The Tale of Genji\" by Lady Murasaki provide examples of miyabi.\n"}

{"id": "13425774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13425774", "title": "Ornate box turtle", "text": "Ornate box turtle\n\nThe ornate box turtle (\"Terrapene ornata ornata\") is one of only two terrestrial species of turtles native to the Great Plains of the United States. It is one of the two different subspecies of \"Terrapene ornata\". It is the state reptile of Kansas. It is a relatively small turtle, that is currently listed as threatened in Illinois but is of concern and protected in six Midwestern states (Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska, Kansas, and Wisconsin). Males and females generally look alike but males are often smaller; there is color variation with yellow lines from the center of the shell to the edges through gray, red-brown, or black coloration. Besides the size, males can be distinguished from females in several ways; a large curved inner claw on the back feet, a cloacal opening that is farther back in males, a longer and thicker tail, and reddish color on the legs and occasionally on the jaw.\n\nThe home range of the ornate box turtle covers a large area of the Midwest, from Wisconsin to the Gulf of Mexico and from Louisiana to Colorado. It was first discovered in Nebraska in 1795, where \"vast numbers\" were found. The turtle is usually found in grasslands and on land rather than in water; they have been found in all habitat types of the Great Plains except aquatic, though most references indicate they prefer open grass or prairie lands. Several studies indicate that the ornate box turtle needs three specific types of microhabitats in order to survive:\nWater is important for this turtle to regulate body temperature in hot weather and to replace body water after hibernation, but they do not spend large amounts of time in flowing or standing water.\n\nThe ornate box turtle, like all reptiles, is ectothermic, which means that its body temperature is affected by the environmental temperature and the environmental temperature affects its movement. In the hottest part of the day, the turtle is less active because movement increases body temperature and makes it harder for the turtle to keep cool, and when the temperature is lower(dawn and dusk), the turtle is more active. Additionally, the turtles use their habitat to help control their body temperature. Shrubs are commonly utilized for the shade the plants produce, helping to further regulate the animal's temperature. Open areas of sand are also important parts of the turtle's habitat for digging holes to burrow in.\n\nIn winter, ornate box turtles hibernate underground in burrows. They burrow in at about the same time in the fall and come out within 7–14 days of each other. They can survive freezing soil temperatures for many days. The depth of nest cavities in Nebraska in 1997 and 1998 was 16.8 cm and the depth of hatchlings buried in the soil ranged from 56.3 cm to 64.7 cm. In Nebraska, winter burrows were dug after October and turtles stayed in them until April and all of these turtles were in individual burrows.\n\nThe home range area of ornate box turtles varies a lot from study to study, from as small as 0.12 hectares to as large as 36.4 hectares. The large variability in home range size estimates can be affected by seasonality, body size and age, time period of observation, presence of roads or other structures, statistics used, and other factors. The ornate box turtle has a high degree of philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area year after year, and it usually prefers the same habitat type as the original one. Ornate box turtles were two times more likely to be found in the same sub-habitat type as the original and even more likely to be in a sub-habitat next to the original habitat than areas two sub-habitats away.\n\nThe ornate box turtle is an omnivore, with no particular dietary preferences; as an opportunistic feeder, it eats whatever is available in any given location or season. Grasses, berries, insects and other invertebrates (caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms), fruits, vegetables, and carrion (mammals, birds, amphibians, snakes, and even other turtles). This varied diet means the turtle has very little competition for available food resources.\n\nThe lifespan of the ornate box turtle has been reported to be from 32 to 37 years, with studies showing that males occur about half as frequently as females. The reason for the predominance of females is thought to be primarily due to temperature; incubating eggs at 29 °C (84 °F) produces 100% female offspring, so in the wild a combination of temperature, humidity, and other factors are thought to favor female differentiation.\n\nBirds, such as crows, raptors, and ravens; domestic cats and dogs; opossums; raccoons; skunks; snakes; and even adult box turtles; are potential predators of young turtles. The turtle has very little means of self-defense other than closing the shell, though they may potentially bite if handled.\n\nUntil recently, there was very little scientific knowledge of diseases and parasites among the turtle populations; early studies showed that a genus of fly sometimes infested the legs of these turtles and caused death by starvation because their movement was impeded. More recently, it has been found that respiratory, metabolic, and shell diseases, common in desert tortoises, also fairly common in land turtles such as the ornate box turtle; and that nutritional deficiencies contribute to these other diseases.\n\nThe age of ornate box turtles has been estimated by counting growth rings for many years. This is similar to estimating the age of a tree but for turtles, the \"rings\" are lines that form on part of the shell that are like scales and the longer a turtle lives, the more rings are formed. However, using the rings to estimate age is not always reliable. The shell does increase in size as turtles get older, even though its weight makes it heavy to carry around.\n\nBecause of its late reproductive age, low reproductive rate, high young mortality, and long lifespan, the ornate box turtle is subject to pressure from intrinsic factors that limit the population growth. Young turtles are vulnerable to predation until the shell is strong enough to be a major protection (except from being run over by cars). The loss of any older females is a problem, because they don’t get replaced very fast. Climatic factors are also possible threats to the ornate box turtle. Because the sex of turtles is strongly influenced by temperature, the sex ratio can be changed by climatic extremes and result in a population that is mostly all one sex for several years in a row. This gender imbalance would affect the survival of small groups that would be threatened by the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck which means the gene pool would be too small and cause inbreeding and mortality. The bottleneck effect is a double-edged sword for species that live a long time because the loss of genetic diversity would not be as obvious or as severe, but once it occurred, it would be harder to recover. The other thing about the ornate box turtle’s life history that is a problem for its survival is its home range philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area every time and so disruptions in the area make it more vulnerable.\n\nThe ornate box turtle is a terrestrial turtle and terrestrial turtles are sensitive to human causes such as habitat destruction, introduced species, harvest or collection, pollution, and climate change.\n\nAgriculture – agriculture in the Great Plains has been the worst problem for the ornate box turtle recently because it has taken away lots of acres of land, destroyed habitat, caused more traffic, and created small, isolated areas of prairie. In addition, the small pieces of prairie mean more edge habitats, which causes more predators to live there and that increases predation of the box turtle that is already suffering from less total habitat area. Other agricultural factors that are a problem for the ornate box turtle are fences, water troughs, cattle (trampling), mowing, and other machinery.\n\nDevelopment – houses and other building construction causes loss of habitat similar to agriculture, but also increased removal for pets, predation by dogs, and greater predation to crows and raccoons that increase around human living areas. Where housing developments are built, there are also more roads. The box turtle feeds on carrion when it is available and on roads road-kill is a large source of carrion and a large cause of death of ornate box turtles.\n\nOver-exploitation – a huge number of ornate box turtles have been collected for sale in pet stores, and individuals have always collected some turtles. The commercial trade has had a large effect on the Great Plains populations and if it continues, the result will be a serious decline in turtles.\n\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the ornate box turtle is \"near threatened.\" In some states, such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, the turtle is \"secure\"; but in South Dakota, it is listed as \"imperiled\"; and in Wyoming it is listed as \"critically imperiled.\" Management decisions for the ornate box turtle are difficult because of life history factors. It seems that the best strategies will be aimed at older females to increase their survival instead of concentrating on hatchlings and juvenile turtles. One of the first things that needs to be done is to get a better idea of the actual number of ornate box turtles that exist and also to make it illegal to collect any for pet or commercial trade, as some states did. Along with this is the need to stop the release of captive box turtles that have respiratory infections into the wild because of the effect of disease on survival. Management techniques that preserve the best habitat composition are important conservation practices.\n\nProbably the biggest factor that affects the ornate box turtle is interactions with human so any action that minimizes contact is helpful. Working to keep large areas of habitat undisturbed is also helpful. Managing weeds with a minimal amount of herbicide and knowing what chemicals are in the herbicide and how they affect turtles is important. The use of fire and mowing to control weeds should be done carefully when turtles are inactive or in burrows to keep cool. The public is not likely to want to stop collecting turtles, even if the pet trade were prohibited, because people like to look at turtles and other forms of nature. Nebraska and Louisiana have prohibited collecting ornate box turtles, but New Mexico and Texas have not.\nEducating the public about the risks to the ornate box turtle will be difficult but should be part of the conservation effort. One conservation effort that might be helpful is removal of predators from an area where many turtles are found; one study found that removing raccoons was helpful but it also leads to the question of balance in nature and which animals are more important. Some biologists have suggested that moving turtles from healthy populations to areas where the turtle is struggling might be an option but this is difficult and might be a last resort.\n\nHabitat loss is the biggest problem for the ornate box turtle and isolated habitat areas have isolated groups of turtles that lose genetic diversity and experience bottlenecks that decrease their survival.\n"}
{"id": "54217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54217", "title": "Pigeonhole principle", "text": "Pigeonhole principle\n\nIn mathematics, the pigeonhole principle states that if formula_1 items are put into formula_2 containers, with formula_3, then at least one container must contain more than one item. This theorem is exemplified in real life by truisms like \"in any group of three gloves there must be at least two left gloves or at least two right gloves\". It is an example of a counting argument. This seemingly obvious statement can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results; for example, that there are two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.\n\nThe first formalization of the idea is believed to have been made by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1834 under the name \"Schubfachprinzip\" (\"drawer principle\" or \"shelf principle\"). For this reason it is also commonly called Dirichlet's box principle or Dirichlet's drawer principle. This should not be confused with Dirichlet's principle, a term introduced by Riemann that refers to the minimum principle for harmonic functions. \n\nThe principle has several generalizations and can be stated in various ways. In a more quantified version: for natural numbers formula_4 and formula_2, if formula_6 objects are distributed among formula_2 sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least formula_8 objects. For arbitrary formula_1 and formula_2 this generalizes to formula_11 where formula_12 and formula_13 denote the floor and ceiling functions, respectively.\n\nThough the most straightforward application is to finite sets (such as pigeons and boxes), it is also used with infinite sets that cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence. To do so requires the formal statement of the pigeonhole principle, which is \"there does not exist an injective function whose codomain is smaller than its domain\". Advanced mathematical proofs like Siegel's lemma build upon this more general concept.\n\nDirichlet published his works in both French and German, using either the German \"Schubfach\" (he wrote about distributing pearls), or the French \"tiroir\". The strict original meaning of both corresponds to the English \"drawer\", an \"open-topped box that can be slid in and out of the cabinet that contains it\". These terms were morphed to the word \"pigeonhole\", standing for a \"small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers\", metaphorically rooted in the structures that house pigeons.\n\nSince Dirichlet's father was a postmaster, and furniture with pigeonholes is commonly used for storing or sorting things into many categories (like letters in a post office or room keys in a hotel), the translation \"pigeonhole\" may be a perfect rendering of Dirichlet's metaphor. That understanding of the word, referring to some furniture features, is fading —especially among those who do not speak English natively but as a lingua franca in the scientific world— in favour of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. The suggestive, though not misleading interpretation of \"pigeonhole\" as \"dovecote\" has lately found its way back to a German \"re-translation\" of the \"pigeonhole\"-principle as the \"Taubenschlag\"-principle.\n\nBesides the original terms \"Schubfach-Prinzip\" in German and \"Principe de tiroirs\" in French, other literal translations are still in use in Polish (\"zasada szufladkowa\"), Bulgarian (\"принцип на чекмеджетата\"), Turkish (\"çekmece ilkesi\"), Hungarian (\"skatulyaelv\"), Italian (\"principio dei cassetti\"), Dutch (\"ladenprincipe \"), Danish (\"Skuffeprincippet\"), Persian (\"اصل لانه کبوتری\"), Chinese (\"抽屉原理\"), and Japanese (\"引き出し論法\").\n\nAssume a drawer contains a mixture of black socks and blue socks, each of which can be worn on either foot, and that you are pulling a number of socks from the drawer without looking. What is the minimum number of pulled socks required to guarantee a pair of the same color? Using the pigeonhole principle, to have at least one pair of the same color holes, one per color) using one pigeonhole per color, you need to pull only three socks from the drawer items). Either you have \"three\" of one color, or you have \"two\" of one color and \"one\" of the other.\n\nIf there are people who can shake hands with one another (where ), the pigeonhole principle shows that there is always a pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to , there are possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves people to be placed into at most non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.\n\nWe can demonstrate there must be at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, it is reasonable to assume (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( is bigger than 1 million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there must be at least two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, ). For the average case () with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the \"collision\" happens before we get to the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).\n\nThere is a passing, satirical, allusion in English to this version of the principle in \"A History of the Athenian Society\", prefixed to \"A Supplement to the Athenian Oracle: Being a Collection of the\nRemaining Questions and Answers in the Old Athenian Mercuries\", (Printed for Andrew Bell, London, 1710). It seems that the question \"whether there were any two persons in the World that have an equal number of hairs on their head?\" had been raised in \"The Athenian Mercury\" before 1704.\n\nPerhaps the first written reference to the pigeonhole principle appears in 1622 in a short sentence of the Latin work \"Selectæ Propositiones\", by the French Jesuit Jean Leurechon, where he wrote \"It is necessary that two men have the same number of hairs, écus, or other things, as each other.\"\n\nThe birthday problem asks, for a set of randomly chosen people, what is the probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday? By the pigeonhole principle, if there are 367 people in the room, we know that there is at least one pair who share the same birthday, as there are only 366 possible birthdays to choose from (including February 29, if present). \nThe birthday \"paradox\" refers to the result that even if the group is as small as 23 individuals, the probability that there is a pair of people with the same birthday is still above 50%. While at first glance this may seem surprising, it intuitively makes sense when considering that a comparison will actually be made between every possible pair of people rather than fixing one individual and comparing them solely to the rest of the group.\n\nImagine seven people who want to play in a tournament of teams items), with a limitation of only four teams holes) to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be at least one team featuring at least two of the seven players: \n\nAny subset of size six from the set = {1,2,3...,9} must contain two elements whose sum is 10. The pigeonholes will be labelled by the two element subsets {1,9}, {2,8}, {3,7}, {4,6} and the singleton {5}, five pigeonholes in all. When the six \"pigeons\" (elements of the size six subset) are placed into these pigeonholes, each pigeon going into the pigeonhole that has it contained in its label, at least one of the pigeonholes labelled with a two element subset will have two pigeons in it.\n\nThe principle can be used to prove that any lossless compression algorithm, provided it makes some inputs smaller (as the name compression suggests), will also make some other inputs larger. Otherwise, the set of all input sequences up to a given length could be mapped to the (much) smaller set of all sequences of length less than without collisions (because the compression is lossless), a possibility which the pigeonhole principle excludes.\n\nA notable problem in mathematical analysis is, for a fixed irrational number , to show that the set {[ is an integer} of fractional parts is dense in [0, 1]. One finds that it is not easy to explicitly find integers such that , where is a small positive number and is some arbitrary irrational number. But if one takes such that , by the pigeonhole principle there must be } such that and are in the same integer subdivision of size (there are only such subdivisions between consecutive integers). In particular, we can find such that is in , and is in , for some integers and in }. We can then easily verify that is in . This implies that , where or . This shows that 0 is a limit point of {[]}. We can then use this fact to prove the case for in : find such that ; then if ], we are done. Otherwise ], and by setting }, one obtains .\n\nVariants occurring in well known proofs:\nIn the proof of the pumping lemma for regular languages, a version that mixes finite and infinite sets is used: If infinitely many objects are placed into finitely many boxes, then there exist two objects that share a box.\nIn Fisk's solution of the Art gallery problem a sort of converse is used: If \"n\" objects are placed into \"k\" boxes, then there is a box containing at most \"n\"/\"k\" objects.\n\nThe following are alternate formulations of the pigeonhole principle.\n\n\nLet be positive integers. If\nobjects are distributed into boxes, then either the first box contains at least objects, or the second box contains at least objects, ..., or the th box contains at least objects.\n\nThe simple form is obtained from this by taking , which gives objects. Taking gives the more quantified version of the principle, namely:\n\nLet and be positive integers. If objects are distributed into boxes, then at least one of the boxes contains or more of the objects.\n\nThis can also be stated as, if discrete objects are to be allocated to containers, then at least one container must hold at least formula_16 objects, where formula_17 is the ceiling function, denoting the smallest integer larger than or equal to . \nSimilarly, at least one container must hold no more than formula_18 objects, where formula_19 is the floor function, denoting the largest integer smaller than or equal to .\n\nA probabilistic generalization of the pigeonhole principle states that if pigeons are randomly put into pigeonholes with uniform probability , then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon with probability\n\nwhere is the falling factorial . For and for (and ), that probability is zero; in other words, if there is just one pigeon, there cannot be a conflict. For (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even if the number of pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes (), due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair when you add more pigeons. This problem is treated at much greater length in the birthday paradox.\n\nA further probabilistic generalization is that when a real-valued random variable has a finite mean , then the probability is nonzero that is greater than or equal to , and similarly the probability is nonzero that is less than or equal to . To see that this implies the standard pigeonhole principle, take any fixed arrangement of pigeons into holes and let be the number of pigeons in a hole chosen uniformly at random. The mean of is , so if there are more pigeons than holes the mean is greater than one. Therefore, is sometimes at least 2.\n\nThe pigeonhole principle can be extended to infinite sets by phrasing it in terms of cardinal numbers: if the cardinality of set is greater than the cardinality of set , then there is no injection from to . However, in this form the principle is tautological, since the meaning of the statement that the cardinality of set is greater than the cardinality of set is exactly that there is no injective map from to . However, adding at least one element to a finite set is sufficient to ensure that the cardinality increases.\n\nAnother way to phrase the pigeonhole principle for finite sets is similar to the principle that finite sets are Dedekind finite: Let and be finite sets. If there is a surjection from to that is not injective, then no surjection from to is injective. In fact no function of any kind from to is injective. This is not true for infinite sets: Consider the function on the natural numbers that sends 1 and 2 to 1, 3 and 4 to 2, 5 and 6 to 3, and so on.\n\nThere is a similar principle for infinite sets: If uncountably many pigeons are stuffed into countably many pigeonholes, there will exist at least one pigeonhole having uncountably many pigeons stuffed into it.\n\nThis principle is not a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for finite sets however: It is in general false for finite sets. In technical terms it says that if and are finite sets such that any surjective function from to is not injective, then there exists an element of of such that there exists a bijection between the preimage of and . This is a quite different statement, and is absurd for large finite cardinalities.\n\nYakir Aharonov et al. have presented arguments that the pigeonhole principle may be violated in quantum mechanics, and proposed interferometric experiments to test the pigeonhole principle in quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\n"}

In ROOM these are called \"actor references\" or \"actor refs\" for short.\nThis allows to create structural hierarchies of arbitrary depth.\n\nThe actor's ports can be part of its interface (visible from the exterior) or part of its structure (used by itself) or both.\nPorts that are part of the interface only are called \"relay ports\".\nThey are directly connected to a port of a sub actor (they are delegating to the sub actor).\nPorts that are part of the structure only are called \"internal end ports\".\nPorts that belong to both, structure and interface, are called \"external end ports\".\n\nEach actor in ROOM has a behavior which is defined by means of a hierarchical finite-state machine, or just state machine for short.\nA state machine is a directed graph consisting of nodes called \"states\" and edges called \"transitions\".\nState transitions are triggered by incoming messages from an internal or external end port.\nIn this context the messages sometimes are also called \"events\" or \"signals\".\nIf a transition specifies a certain \"trigger\" then it is said to \"fire\" if the state machine is in the source state of the transition and a message of the type specified by the trigger arrives. Afterwards the state is changed to the target state of the transition.\n\nDuring the state change certain pieces of code are executed. The programmer (or modeler) can attach them to the states and transitions.\nIn ROOM this code is written in the so called \"detail level language\", usually the target language of the code generation.\nA state can have \"entry code\" and \"exit code\". During a state change first the exit code of the source state is executed.\nThen the \"action code\" of the firing transition is executed and finally the entry code of the target state.\nA typical part of those codes is the sending of messages through ports of the actor.\n\nState machines in ROOM also have a graphical notation similar to the UML state charts. An example is shown in the diagram in this section.\n\nA state machine can also have a hierarchy in the sense that states can have sub state machines. Similar to the structure this can be extended to arbitrary depth.\nFor details of the semantics of hierarchical state machines we refer to the original book.\n\nAn important concept in the context of state machines is the execution model of \"run-to-completion\". That means that an actor is processing a message completely before it accepts the next message. Since the run-to-completion semantics is guaranteed by the execution environment, the programmer/modeler doesn't have to deal with classical thread synchronization. And this despite the fact that typical ROOM systems are highly concurrent because of the asynchronous communication.\nAnd maybe its worth to stress that the asynchronous nature of ROOM systems is not by accident but reflects the inherent asynchronicity of e.g. the machine being controlled by the software. Definitely this requires another mind set than the one that is needed for functional programming of synchronous systems.\nBut after a short while of getting accustomed it will be evident that asynchronously communicating state machines are perfectly suited for control software.\n\nLike other object oriented programming languages ROOM uses the concept of classes.\nActors are classes which can be instantiated as objects several times in the system.\nOf course each instance of an actor class is in its own state and can communicate with other instances of the same (and other) classes.\n\nSimilar to other modern programming languages ROOM allows inheritance of actor classes.\nIt is a single inheritance as an actor class can be derived from another actor class (its \"base class\").\nIt inherits all features of the base class like ports and actor refs, but also the state machine.\nThe derived actor class can add further states and transitions to the inherited one.\n\nA last powerful concept of ROOM is \"layering\". This notion refers to the vertical layers of a software system consisting of services and their clients. ROOM introduces the notions of \"service access point (SAP)\" for the client side and \"service provision point (SPP)\" for the server side. From the point of view of an actor implementation the SAPs and SPPs work like ports. Like ports they are associated with a protocol. But other than ports they don't have to (and even cannot) be bound explicitly.\nRather, an actor is bound to a concrete service by a \"layer connection\" and this binding of a service is propagated recursively to all sub actors of this actor.\nThis concept is very similar to dependency injection.\n\n"}
{"id": "320162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320162", "title": "Red grouse", "text": "Red grouse\n\nThe red grouse, \"Lagopus lagopus scotica\", is a medium-sized bird of the grouse family which is found in heather moorland in Great Britain and Ireland. It is usually classified as a subspecies of the willow ptarmigan but is sometimes considered to be a separate species, \"Lagopus scotica\". It is also known as the moorcock, moorfowl or moorbird. \"Lagopus\" is derived from Ancient Greek (), meaning \"hare\", + (), \"foot\", in reference to the feathered feet and toes typical of this cold-adapted genus, and \"scoticus\" is \"of Scotland\".\n\nThe red grouse is widely known as the logo of The Famous Grouse whisky and an animated bird is a character in a series of its adverts. The red grouse is also the emblem of the journal \"British Birds\".\n\nThe red grouse is differentiated from the willow ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan by its plumage being reddish brown, and not having a white winter plumage. The tail is black and the legs are white. There are white stripes on the underwing and red combs over the eye. Females are less reddish than the males and have less conspicuous combs. Young birds are duller and lack the red combs.\n\nBirds in Ireland are sometimes thought to belong to a separate subspecies \"L. l. hibernica\". They are slightly paler than those in Britain and the females have yellower plumage with more finely barred underparts. This may be an adaptation to camouflage them in moorland with higher grass and sedge content and less heather.\n\nIt is identified by its \"chut!chut!chut!chut!chut!chuttt...\" call, or the \"Goback, goback, goback\" vocalisation. The wings make a whirring sound when the bird is disturbed from a resting place.\n\nGrouse populations display periodic cycling, where the population builds up to very high densities only to crash a few years later, and then recover. The main driver of this cyclic pattern is thought to be the parasitic nematode worm \"Trichostrongylus tenuis\".\n\nHowever, in his book, V. C. Wynne-Edwards suggests that the primary reason for mortality in grouse population is homeostasis depending largely on food availability and that the 'Grouse disease', due to the parasitic worm \"Trichostrongylus tenuis\" is a mistaken diagnosis of the after effects of social exclusion.\n\nThe red grouse is endemic to the British Isles; it has developed in isolation from other subspecies of the willow ptarmigan which are widespread in northern parts of Eurasia and North America.\n\nIt is found across most parts of Scotland, including Orkney, Shetland and most of the Outer Hebrides. They are only absent from urban areas, such as in the Central Belt.\n\nIn Wales there are strong populations in places but their range has retracted. They are now largely absent from the far south, their main strongholds being Snowdonia, the Brecon Beacons and the Cambrian Mountains. There are reports of Welsh birds crossing the Bristol Channel to Exmoor.\n\nIn England it is mainly found in the north – places such as the Lake District, Northumberland, County Durham, much of Yorkshire, the Pennines and the Peak District, as far south as the Staffordshire Moorlands. There is an isolated introduced population on Dartmoor, and overspill Welsh birds visit the Shropshire Hills such as Long Mynd, where they breed. The Exmoor population would now appear to be extinct, with the last birds sighted as recently as 2005. An introduced population in Suffolk died out by the early 20th century, though a population on Cannock Chase in Staffordshire lasted longer.\n\nIn Ireland it is found locally in most parts of the country: it is commonest in Mayo, where the population is increasing, and on the Antrim plateau, with other healthy populations in the Slieve Bloom mountains and the Knockmealdown mountains; a few pairs still breed in south County Dublin.\n\nThe small population in the Isle of Man is mostly concentrated in the southern hills but conservation work is ongoing throughout the uplands to ensure the species' continued viability.\n\nIts typical habitat is upland heather moors away from trees. It can also be found in some low-lying bogs and birds may visit farmland during hard weather.\n\nThe British population is estimated at about 250,000 pairs with around 1–5,000 pairs in Ireland. Numbers have declined in recent years and birds are now absent in areas where they were once common. Reasons for the decline include loss of heather due to overgrazing, creation of new conifer plantations and a decline in the number of upland gamekeepers. Some predators such as the hen harrier feed on grouse and there is ongoing controversy as to what effect these have on grouse numbers.\n\nRed grouse have been introduced to the Hautes Fagnes region of Belgium but the population there died out in the early 1970s.\n\nThe red grouse is herbivorous and feeds mainly on the shoots, seeds and flowers of heather. It will also feed on berries, cereal crops and sometimes insects.\n\nThe birds begin to form pairs during the autumn and males become increasingly territorial as winter progresses. The nest is a shallow scrape up to 20 cm across which is lined with vegetation. About six to nine eggs are laid, mainly during April and May. They are oval, glossy and pale yellow with dark brown blotches. The eggs are incubated for 19 to 25 days, the chicks can fly after 12 to 13 days after hatching and are fully grown after 30 to 35 days.\n\nMember States of the European Union are obliged by virtue of Council Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds (popularly called the Birds Directive) to take the requisite measures for the protection of the red grouse; but as it is a species to which Annex II of the Directive applies, Article 7 permits hunting under national law, provided population levels are not threatened as a result. In 2002 Ireland was found by the European Court of Justice to be in breach of its obligations under the earlier Directive to protect the red grouse, in that it had allowed a crucial breeding ground to become degraded through overgrazing by sheep. Conservation measures taken on foot of the judgment have seen the population in the area double from 400 to 800.\n\nThe red grouse is considered a game bird and is shot in large numbers during the shooting season which traditionally starts on August 12, known as the Glorious Twelfth. There is a keen competition among some London restaurants to serve freshly killed grouse on August 12, with the birds being flown from the moors and cooked within hours.\nShooting can take the form of 'walked up' (where shooters walk across the moor to flush grouse and take a shot) or 'driven' (where grouse are driven, often in large numbers, by 'beaters' towards the guns who are hiding behind a line of 'butts'). Many moors are managed to increase the density of grouse. Areas of heather are subjected to controlled burning; this allows fresh young shoots to regenerate, which are favoured by the grouse. Extensive predator control, including illegal killing of raptors, is a feature of grouse moor management: foxes, stoats and crows are usually heavily controlled on grouse moors. The extent to which it occurs on grouse moors is hotly contested between conservation groups and shooting interests, and the subject generates a lot of media attention in relation to grouse moors and shooting.\n\nIn recent decades the practice of using medicated grit and direct dosing of birds against an endoparasite, the strongyle worm or threadworm (\"Trichostrongylus tenuis\"), has become part of the management regime on many moors.\n\nThe flavour of grouse, like most game birds, develops if the bird is hung for a few days after shooting and before eating. Roasting is the most common way to cook a grouse.\n\n\"The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie\" (1909) has 11 recipes for using grouse. The recipe \"To cook old birds\" runs as follows:\nBecause of their economic and social importance and some interesting aspects of their biology, red grouse have been widely studied. They were the subject of some of the earliest studies of population biology in birds, as detailed in \" The Grouse in Health and in Disease\" by Lord Lovat in 1911. Since the mid-20th century they have been subject to ongoing study by many organisations and individuals. Much work has been conducted by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in the eastern Cairngorms, and by the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust in the Central Highlands. There are a wide range of research activities still going on today and a wealth of published literature exists on all aspects of grouse biology.\n\nThe red grouse may be infected by parasites and viruses which severely affect populations. Strongylosis or 'grouse disease' is caused by the strongyle worm, which induces damage and internal bleeding after burrowing into the cecum. This endoparasite is often eaten with the tops of young heather shoots and can lead to mortality and poor condition, including a decrease in the bird's ability to control the scent it emits.\n\nLouping ill virus is a flavivirus (RNA virus), also known as sheep encephalomyelitis virus. Flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, and louping ill virus is transmitted by ticks. In red grouse, this virus can cause mortality as high as 78%. The main tick vector is the sheep tick \"Ixodes ricinus\". Although traditionally tick-borne diseases are thought to be caused when the parasite bites its host, it has been shown that red grouse chicks can be affected when they eat ticks with which they come into contact. This virus may be a significant factor in red grouse populations.\n\n"}

Edited by Walter H. Conser, Jr., Ronald M. McCarthy, David J. Toscano and Gene Sharp, the book was published in the United States in 1986. It argues that the Stamp Act resistance and other campaigns from 1765 to 1775 were fundamental for shaping the outcome of the struggle for American independence, and were not merely a \"prelude\" to armed conflict.\n\nNonviolent resistance was at the heart of these campaigns, but key features of this nonviolence have been largely neglected by historians. To fill this perceived gap, the book provides a sustained narrative of the 1765–1775 resistance, followed by a set of interpretive essays aimed to provoke further discussion and inquiry. Six hypothetical explanations are offered for why the colonists shifted to military struggle, despite the considerable success of nonviolent struggle.\nReviews have appeared in several historical and legal journals.\n\n\"Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775\" (\"RPASI\"), claims that most historians of colonial America have treated the events of 1765–1775 as merely a \"prelude\" \nto the US Revolutionary War. Events such as the resistance to the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts are typically treated as \"not significant in themselves.\"\nThis book, however\n\nIn their preface, the editors state that their interest in the historical period covered in \"RPASI\" began in the 1970s, when they were studying nonviolent action as a pragmatic tool of civilian struggle. In their work, they\n\nIndeed, \"researchers often look throughout the length of a period for evidence of what they regard as its inevitable outcome... for example... for the roots of war... In the process, they... may ignore the contributions of alternative means to the outcome.\" An example is that \"Samuel Adams, whom many... associate with the tactics of violence, issued numerous statements prior to Lexington and Concord opposing the use of armed force\" (see quote at left).\n\nThe book project was originally conceived due to recognition by co-editor Gene Sharp, a leading scholar of nonviolent struggle, that the American colonists had \"employed the techniques of nonviolent resistance\" in their struggle against Great Britain. \n\nThe book was sponsored by Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, and by the Albert Einstein Institution, both led by Sharp. \nThe editors claim that the book \"if read carefully, is likely to spark scholarly controversy and argument,\" and that they \"believe that such debate can clarify the issues... and enhance the understanding of this critical decade in our history.\"\n\n\"Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765-1775\" contains 14 chapters that are intended to \"relate integrally to one another and provide a complete narrative of the period [of 1765-1775].\" These chapters are listed in the table at right.\n\nAfter the first introductory chapter, the next 7 chapters contain the book's \"narrative section,\" which focuses on describing the struggles from 1765 to 1775 chronologically, using the \"terminology of the day,\" and only \"rarely [making] use of the term ‘nonviolent action.’\"\nThe book's final 6 chapters are analytical, offering interpretations of the decade's events. These chapters address questions raised in the narrative section, and also suggest areas for future research.\n\nBasic concepts are introduced in Chapter 1, which gives an overview of the three main resistance campaigns of 1765 to 1775 opposing the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townsend Acts of 1767, and the Coercive Acts of 1774. Nonviolent action is described as a technique that operates to bring about change through serving to \"manipulate the shared social, cultural, economic and political system in which the opposing parties engage in conflict.\" Citing Sharp's \"Politics of Nonviolent Action\", they divide methods of nonviolent action into the three categories of \"nonviolent protest and persuasion\", \"noncooperation\", and \"nonviolent intervention\". Nonviolent action succeeds by \"rendering the opponent's sources of power unusable, unworkable, and uncontrollable,\" through mechanisms that may include conversion, accommodation, or \"nonviolent coercion [that] occurs when an opponent is forced against his or her will to grant the actionists' demands.\"\n\nThe editors argue (Ch. 1) that previous scholarship has overlooked \"the degree to which the colonists used a kind of 'weapons system' that operated without force of arms or violence in trying to compel the British government to change its policies.\" Viewed from this angle, commercial resistance (nonimportation) is analyzed closely (Ch. 9). It is apparent that the colonists' skill in applying the methods of nonviolent struggle \"improved greatly over the decade,\" as did the \"intellectual underpinnings\" of their resistance (Chs. 10, 11).\n\nStill, at the close of the decade, the nonviolent movement was abandoned in favor of military resistance, and the editors discuss six alternative hypothetical explanations for why this shift occurred (Ch. 12; see table at right). The hypothetical explanations are not meant as mutually exclusive, but as \"avenues for fruitful inquiry.\" Indeed,\n\nJohn Adams (quoted above right), who lived through and helped lead the independence struggle, claimed that \"The revolution was... substantially effected before hostilities commenced.\" McCarthy (Ch. 14) argues that \"independence in many of the colonies had essentially been achieved prior to the commencement of military hostilities at Lexington and Concord.\"\nThe book concludes with 7 appendices that reproduce key historical materials (see table below right), as well as a 23-page index.\n\nReviews have appeared in \nthe \"Journal of Southern History\"\nthe \"Journal of American History\",\nand the \"Law and History Review\".\n\nIn the \"Journal of Southern History\", Mills wrote of \"RPASI\" that \"Although the work covers familiar ground, the approach is fresh and the treatment is stimulating. The interpretative theme is certain to provoke debate.\"\nHe added that \"The criticisms one might make of this study are cosmetic (e.g., the considerable variations in the sizes of several chapters) rather than substantive.\"\n\nIn the \"Journal of American History\", Ireland commended the historical essays as shedding light on important aspects of the American Revolution, stating that \"having them collected together in one place is useful.\" He was critical of most chapters by the editors as \"much less valuable,\" and came away feeling \"that I have missed the point, or that there is no point here of any great moment for a historian.\"\n\nIn \"Law and History Review\", Roeber wrote that \"RPASI\" \"includes stimulating essays by ten authors, four British,\" and\n\nBut in the American colonial frontier, \"military tactics were acknowledged by all to be more vicious than those employed in European conflicts.\" Thus, for Roeber, \"One comes away from this rich and stimulating series of essays with the disturbing sense that Americans had, at the very time of the Republic's founding, been swept up on a tide of violent resistance that fit with their colonial frontier experience.\"\n\nMills wrote that \"One can hope that the challenge to conduct more research into the period from 1774 to 1775 and the shift from nonviolent to violent action will be heeded.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "285141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285141", "title": "Romance (love)", "text": "Romance (love)\n\nRomance is an emotional feeling of love for, or a strong attraction towards, another person, and the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions.\n\nAlthough the emotions and sensations of \"romantic love\" are widely associated with sexual attraction, romantic feelings can exist without expectation of physical consummation and be subsequently expressed. Historically, the term \"romance\" originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in the literature of chivalric romance.\n\nRomantic love is a relative term that distinguishes moments and situations within intimate relationships as contributing to a deepened relational connection.\n\nThe word \"romance\" comes from the French vernacular where initially it indicated a verse narrative. The word was originally an adverb of Latin origin, \"romanicus,\" meaning \"of the Roman style\". European medieval vernacular tales, epics, and ballads generally dealt with chivalric adventure, not bringing in the concept of love until late into the seventeenth century.\n\nThe word \"romance\" developed other meanings, such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of \"adventurous\" and \"passionate,\" which could intimate both \"love affair\" and \"idealistic quality.\"\nAnthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance.\n\nBefore the 18th century, many marriages were not arranged, but rather developed out of more or less spontaneous relationships. After the 18th century, illicit relationships took on a more independent role. In bourgeois marriage, illicitness may have become more formidable and likely to cause tension. In \"Ladies of the Leisure Class\", Rutgers University professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes \"When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests.\" Subsequent sexual revolution has lessened the conflicts arising out of liberalism, but not eliminated them.\n\nAnthony Giddens, in his book \"The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society\", states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life. He adds that telling a story was one of the meanings of romance. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and self-realization.\n\nDavid R. Shumway, in his book \"Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis\", states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century and that this discourse claimed to be able to explain how marriage and other relationships worked. For the discourse of intimacy emotional closeness was much more important than passion. This does not mean by any means that intimacy is to replace romance. On the contrary, intimacy and romance coexist.\n\nThe 21st century has seen the growth of globalization and people now live in a world of transformations that affect almost every aspect of our lives, and love has not been the exception. One example of the changes experienced in relationships was explored by Giddens regarding homosexual relationships. According to Giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.\n\nShumway also states that together with the growth of capitalism the older social relations dissolved, including marriage. Marriage meaning for women changed as they had more socially acceptable alternatives and were less willing to accept unhappy relations and, therefore, divorce rates substantially increased.\n\nThe discourse of romance continues to exist today together with intimacy. Shumway states that on the one hand, romance is the part that offers adventure and intense emotions while offering the possibility to find the perfect mate. On the other hand, intimacy offers deep communication, friendship, and long lasting sharing.\n\nThe conception of romantic love was popularized in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Chevaliers, or knights in the Middle Ages, engaged in what were usually non-physical and non-marital relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of chivalry as a moral code of conduct.\n\nCourtly love and the notion of domnei were often the subjects of troubadours, and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since marriage was commonly nothing more than a formal arrangement, courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife. In terms of courtly love, \"lovers\" did not necessarily refer to those engaging in sexual acts, but rather, to the act of caring and to emotional intimacy.\n\nThe bond between a knight and his Lady, or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may have escalated psychologically but seldom ever physically. For knighthood during the Middle Ages, the intrinsic importance of a code of conduct was in large part as a value system of rules codified as a guide to aid a knight in his capacity as champion of the downtrodden, but especially in his service to the Lord.\n\nIn the context of dutiful service to a woman of high social standing, ethics designated as a code were effectively established as an institution to provide a firm moral foundation by which to combat the idea that unfit attentions and affections were to ever be tolerated as \"a secret game of trysts\" behind closed doors. Therefore, a knight trained in the substance of \"chivalry\" was instructed, with especial emphasis, to serve a lady most honorably, with purity of heart and mind. To that end, he committed himself to the welfare of both Lord and Lady with unwavering discipline and devotion, while at the same time, presuming to uphold core principles set forth in the code by the religion by which he followed.\n\nReligious meditations upon the Virgin Mary were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle: the concept of the honor of a lady and knightly devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently as central to the very identity of medieval knighthood. As knights were increasingly emulated, eventual changes were reflected in the inner-workings of feudal society. Members of the aristocracy were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.\n\nBehaviorally, a knight was to regard himself towards a lady with a transcendence of premeditated thought—his virtue ingrained within his character. A chevalier was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades of this to all women, regardless of class, age, or status. Over time, the concept of chivalry and the notion of the courtly gentleman became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and princesses, kings and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.\n\nDe amore or \"The Art of Courtly Love\", as it is known in English, was written in the 12th century. The text is widely misread as permissive of extramarital affairs. However, it is useful to differentiate the physical from without: romantic love as separate and apart from courtly love when interpreting such topics as: \"Marriage is no real excuse for not loving\", \"He who is not jealous cannot love\", \"No one can be bound by a double love\", and \"When made public love rarely endures\".\n\nSome believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues \"therapists mistakenly believe that romantic love is a phenomenon unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages.\"\n\nThe more current and Western traditional terminology meaning \"court as lover\" or the general idea of \"romantic love\" is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words \"romantic\" and \"lover\", thus coining English phrases for romantic love such as \"loving like the Romans do\". The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word \"romance\" or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of \"romantic love\" appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.\n\nRomantic love is contrasted with platonic love, which in all usages, precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully nonsexual sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated. Sublimation tends to be forgotten in casual thought about love aside from its emergence in psychoanalysis and Nietzsche.\n\nUnrequited love can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and egalitarian ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of romanticism, but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.\n\nRomantic love may also be classified according to two categories, \"popular romance\" and \"divine or spiritual\" romance:\n\n\nGreek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in Plato's \"Symposium\". Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the deity Eros. When his turn comes, Aristophanes says in his mythical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures' assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the Aloadae.\n\nThis story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before Alcibiades arrives, Socrates gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of beauty.\n\nThough there are many theories of romantic love—such as that of Robert Sternberg, in which it is merely a mean combining liking and sexual desire—the major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud's theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and Jacques Lacan by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:\n\nRené Girard argues that romantic attraction is a product of jealousy and rivalry—particularly in a triangular form.\n\nGirard, in any case, downplays romance's individuality in favor of jealousy and the love triangle, arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is circular reasoning, but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in mimesis. Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"As You Like It\", and \"The Winter's Tale\" are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.\n\nGirard's theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged sexism. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one's attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.\n\nMimetic desire is often challenged by feminists, such as Toril Moi, who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.\n\nThough the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with capitalism and cynicism native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. Sexual revolutions have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.\n\nThe process of courtship also contributed to Arthur Schopenhauer's pessimism, despite his own romantic success, and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners who share certain interests and tastes, while at the same time looking for a \"complement\" or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the cliché that \"opposites attract\", but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:\n\nBut what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims. \n—\"World as Will and Representation\", Volume 2, Chapter XLIV\n\nLater modern philosophers such as La Rochefoucauld, David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau also focused on morality, but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed \"the passions\", and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of \"passionate\" now equated with \"romantic\". Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of Romanticism, which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the absolute, as well as platonic and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.\n\nFrench philosopher Gilles Deleuze linked this idea of love as a lack mainly to Sigmund Freud, and Deleuze often criticized it.\n\nShakespeare and Søren Kierkegaard share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously \"in tune\" with each other. In Shakespeare's \"Measure for Measure\", for example, \"...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue.\" In \"Romeo and Juliet\", in saying \"all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage\", Romeo implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.\n\nKierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as \"Either/Or\" and \"Stages on Life's Way\":\n\nIn \"How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time\", British writer Iain King tried to establish rules for romance applicable across most cultures. He concluded on six rules, including:\n\nThe \"tragic\" contradiction between romance and society is most forcibly portrayed in literature, in Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\", in Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\", and William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". The female protagonists in such stories are driven to suicide as if dying for a cause of freedom from various oppressions of marriage.\n\nEven after sexual revolutions, on the other hand, to the extent that it does not lead to procreation (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in same-sex marriage), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of stress, as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.\n\nRomance can also be tragic in its conflict with society. The Tolstoy family focuses on the romantic limitations of marriage, and Anna Karenina prefers death to being married to her fiancé, however this is because she is tired of waiting and being hidden away from public, when her fiance makes failed attempts to get his mother's approval of the marriage. Even being aristocrats did not make them both free, as the society was nevertheless equally binding for all. Furthermore, in the speech about marriage that is given in Kierkegaard's \"Either/Or\", Kierkegaard attempts to show that it is because marriage is lacking in passion fundamentally, that the nature of marriage, unlike romance, is explainable by a man who has experience of neither marriage nor love.\n\nReciprocity of the sexes appears in the ancient world primarily in myth where it is in fact often the subject of tragedy, for example in the myths of Theseus and Atalanta. Noteworthy female freedom or power was an exception rather than the rule, though this is a matter of speculation and debate.\n\nMany theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.\n\nAnthropologist Helen Fisher, in her book \"Why We Love\", uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. Norepinephrine and dopamine, among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. She is famous for the use of MRI to study the brain activity of a person \"in love\", discovering the importance of the ventral tegmental area and the caudate nucleus in this biological drive. Fisher concludes that these reactions have a genetic basis, and therefore love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.\n\nIn his book \"What Women Want, What Men Want\", anthropologist John Townsend takes the genetic basis of love one step further by identifying how the sexes are different in their predispositions. Townsend's compilation of various research projects concludes that men are susceptible to youth and beauty, whereas women are susceptible to status and security. These differences are part of a natural selection process where males seek many healthy women of childbearing age to mother offspring, and women seek men who are willing and able to take care of them and their children.\n\nPsychologist Karen Horney in her article \"The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal\", indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.\n\nPsychologist Harold Bessell in his book \"The Love Test\", reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship. Bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls \"romantic attraction\", which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is \"emotional maturity\", which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.\n\nRomantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a person. However, Lisa M. Diamond, a University of Utah psychology professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one's sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests it is as possible for someone who is homosexual to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is heterosexual to fall in love with someone of the same gender. In her 2012 review of this topic, Diamond emphasized that what is true for men may not be true for women. According to Diamond, in most men sexual orientation is fixed and most likely innate, but in many women sexual orientation may vary from 0 to 6 on the Kinsey scale and back again.\n\nMartie Haselton, a psychologist at UCLA, considers romantic love a \"commitment device\" or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her colleagues have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love's adaptation. The first part of the experiments consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than sex.\n\nResearch by the University of Pavia suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar to limerence) before being replaced by a more stable, non-passionate \"companionate love.\" In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.\n\nAttachment styles that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles. Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in children’s attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan. Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment. Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.\n\nSinger (1984a, 1984b, 1987) first defined love based on four Greek terms: \"eros\", meaning the search for beauty; \"philia\", the feelings of affection in close friendships, \"nomos\", the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and \"agape\", the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role (Singer, 1987). However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University (1992, 2009) have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.\n\nResearchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms. Berscheid and Walster (1978) and Hatfield (1988) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish. Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as \"being on cocaine\", since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used. It is also estimated that passionate love (as with limerence) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.\n\nRobert Firestone, a psychologist, has a theory of the fantasy bond, which is what is mostly created after the passionate love has faded. A couple may start to feel really comfortable with each other to the point that they see each other as simply companions or protectors, but yet think that they are still in love with each other. The results to the fantasy bond is the leading to companionate love. \nHendrick and Hendrick (1995) studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, researchers (Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick, 1996) found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.\n\nPsychologist Robert Sternberg (1986) developed the triangular theory of love. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).\nStudies on Sternberg’s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.\n\nResearchers Arthur and Elaine Aron (1986) theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person’s self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self efficacy than those who did not (Aron, Paris, and Aron, 1995).\n\nHarvey and Ormarzu (1997) developed a model of minding relationships with five key components: seeking to know and be known by the other; using knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship; accepting the other person; being motivated to continue this process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and developing a sense of appreciation in the relationship. Each of these components is considered adaptive, however, nonadaptive steps to minding a relationship were also theorized by the research team. The five nonadaptive components include: one or both partners out of step in seeking to know and be known by the other; not using the knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship (or using that knowledge to hurt the other); low acceptance and respect for the other person; not being motivated to continue the process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and failing to develop a sense of appreciation in a relationship. Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab (1994; Gottman & Silver, 1999). He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples’ interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing (Gottman, Driver, & Tabares, 2002).\n\nThe most recent research on romantic love and relationships focuses on behaviors that either sustain a relationship or aid in its dissolution. These behaviors can be considered either appetitive or aversive. Appetitive relationship processes are considered the promotion of positive relationship behaviors, as determined by psychologists Gable and Reis (2001, 2003). Aversive relationship processes are described as eliminating behaviors that have a negative effect on relationships (Gable and Reis 2001, 2003). This new research has also allowed relationship success to be predicted as a function of these appetitive and aversive processes. This is all related to research that shows that sharing positive life events with one’s partner is related to greater relationship satisfaction and intimacy (Gable et al., 2004). In research by Gable et al. (2003) appetitive (promotion of positive relationship behaviors) and aversive (elimination of negative relationship behaviors) processes are independent constructs. A specific type of appetitive processing, capitalization, leads to increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy when one member of the relationship tells the other about positive life events and receive quality reactions and feedback from the partner (Gable, Reis, Impett, & Asher, 2004).\n\nResearchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from 2 weeks to 8 months found that 1 out of 4 adults' attachment style changed. Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles. On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships. In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management, providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.\n\nAnother topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of domestic abuse. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a maladaptation. Oxytocin is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of attachment. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together. It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc. This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in rejection sensitivity exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.\n\nThe feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in kin selection theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and dominance to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.\n\nIn the search for the root of intimate partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies. Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.\n\nRound-trip engineering is closely related to traditional software engineering disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), reverse engineering (creating specifications from existing software), and reengineering (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize \"existing\" artifacts that evolved \"concurrently\" by \"incrementally\" updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.\n\nAnother characteristic of round-trip engineering is \"automatic\" update of the artifacts in response to \"automatically\" detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either \"instantaneous\" or \"on-demand\". In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.\n\nRound trip engineering supports an iterative development process. After you have synchronized your model with revised code, you are still free to choose the best way to work – make further modifications to the code or make changes to your model. You can synchronize in either direction at any time and you can repeat the cycle as many times as necessary.\n\nPerhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML (Unified Modeling Language) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes support this form of RTE; a 2007 book lists Rational Rose, Borland Together, ESS-Model, BlueJ, and Fujaba among those capable, with Fujaba said to be capable to also identify design patterns. Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as \"associations\" and \"containment\" do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). A 2005 book on Visual Studio notes for instance that a common problem in RTE tools is that the model reversed is not the same as the original one, unless the tools are helped by laborious annotations. The behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.\n\nA more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework application programming interfaces (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API \"prescribes\" all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are framework-specific modeling languages and Spring Roo.\n\nRound-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in Object Management Group's (OMG) Model-driven architecture. OMG proposed the QVT (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).\n\nRound-trip engineering based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) needs three basic compoments for software development:\n\n\nAn example of basic round-trip engineering is accessible as a web-based Open Source tool is:\n\n"}
{"id": "31297361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31297361", "title": "Set (psychology)", "text": "Set (psychology)\n\nIn psychology, a set is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. A \"perceptual set\", also called \"perceptual expectancy\", is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. A \"mental set\" is a framework for thinking about a problem. It can be shaped by habit or by desire. Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.\n\nPerception can be shaped by \"top-down\" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise. A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as \"sael\". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as \"seal\", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as \"sail\".\n\nSets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous situations so that they see what they want to see. For instance, a person's experience of the events in a sports match can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams. In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.\n\nPerceptual sets have been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as \"warm\" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word \"warm\" is replaced by \"cold\". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing. Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.\n\nMental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way. They are shaped by past experiences and habits. An inappropriate mental set can hamper the solution of straightforward problems. For example, when people are asked, \"When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?\" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried. A specific form of mental set is \"functional fixedness\", in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put. An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7267027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7267027", "title": "Shell to Sea", "text": "Shell to Sea\n\nShell to Sea () is an Irish organisation based in the parish of Kilcommon in Erris, County Mayo.\n\nIt opposes the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline through the parish, as well as the ongoing construction—by Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil and Vermilion Energy Trust—of a refinery at Bellanaboy intended to refine the natural gas from the Corrib gas field. It proposes instead that the gas be refined at sea, rather than inland, as is done with Ireland's only other producing gas field off County Cork. Shell to Sea believes the proximity of a raw natural gas pipeline is a risk to local residents.\n\nThe three stated aims of the campaign, as cited on its website, are that \"Any exploitation of the Corrib gas field be done in a safe way that will not expose the local community in Erris to unnecessary health, safety and environmental risks\", \"To renegotiate the terms of the Great Oil and Gas Giveaway, which sees Ireland's 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent off the West Coast go directly to the oil companies, with the Irish State retaining a 0% share, no energy security of supply and only 25% tax on profits against which all costs can be deducted\" and \"To seek justice for the human rights abuses suffered by Shell to Sea campaigners due to their opposition to Shell's proposed inland refinery\".\n\nIncidents of note include the 2005 jailing of the Rossport Five and the public outcry that followed, the 2007 Goldman Environmental Prize received by Willie Corduff (one of the five), local fisherman Pat O'Donnell's laying of 800 crab pots at sea and Maura Harrington's hunger strike against the Allseas pipe-laying ship \"Solitaire\" in 2008, an alleged assault on Corduff in 2009 which was condemned by Desmond Tutu, the 2011 \"rape tape\" scandal when Gardaí (police) accidentally filmed themselves joking about the imagined rape of two female protestors after arresting them, and the reports of gifts of alcohol worth tens of thousands of euros from Shell to the Gardaí, which broke in 2013.\n\nOpposition to the gas consortium and government's plans among local residents grew from 2000 when local residents felt they were not adequately consulted. They opposed planning permission and appealed it to An Bord Pleanála twice. It was felt that government pressure was used to force the planning permission through. They also felt misled about the safety of the gas pipeline which did not require planning permission under the 1976 Gas Act.\nThe first event organised by Shell to Sea was on the June Bank Holiday weekend in 2005 in support of Rossport residents' protests.\n\nLocal landowners in Rossport had previously been told that the raw gas pipeline would be coming through their lands no matter what, and that they would be subject to Compulsory Acquisition Orders if unwilling to reach a deal with Shell. Some agreed to allow Shell on their lands. Others refused, and Frank Fahey, then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources signed 34 Compulsory Acquisition Orders. Those who had refused were threatened with legal action. Legal action was taken which eventually culminated in four farmers and their former teacher, who had joined them in blocking Shell workers coming on their lands, being jailed on 29 June for civil contempt of court (at the request of Shell) after refusing to give an undertaking not to interfere with Shell's workers. They became known as the Rossport Five.\n\n24-hour pickets on the Shell sites at Rossport, Bellanaboy and Glengad began after their jailing. Rallies in support of the men's stance were held in major towns and cities, and Shell and Statoil filling stations were picketed. From these protests emerged the national Shell to Sea campaign.\n\nThe Rossport Five were released on 30 September, after their imprisonment had dominated proceedings in the parliament. Peter Cassells was appointed as a negotiator to arbitrate between the campaigners and Shell. As his remit did not include discussing the refinery, he was regarded as a distraction by Shell to Sea. The pickets at Bellanaboy continued for over a year, during which no work was done by Shell.\n\nOn Tuesday 26 September 2006, protesters prevented Shell's employees from entering the site of the intended refinery at Bellanaboy to begin work. Around 150 locals and protesters blocked the entrance to the refinery site and began to recite the rosary. The workers turned back after discussions with Gardaí.\n\nOne week later on 3 October, more Gardaí were brought in from around the country, which increased their numbers to around 170. This marked a departure in Garda tactics which they have held to. An editorial in \"The Irish Times\" stated: \"The Garda baton charges that occurred on Friday morning in Bellanaboy were not the product of Sinn Féin or Provisional IRA machinations; they were the product of abject Government incompetence.\" A decision to avoid arresting protesters in order to damp down the negative publicity that would ensue was discussed in the Garda magazine, \"Garda Review\". A number of people were injured and one young woman was brought to hospital.\n\nProtesters occupied Shell Ireland HQ in Dublin's Leeson Street and daily protests continued at Bellanaboy with some arrests made.\nA second large scale protest march took place on 10 November, the anniversary of the execution of Ken Saro Wiwa and eight other anti-Shell activists in Nigeria in 1995. When protesters worked their way around Gardaí lines, clashes occurred, resulting in several injuries. Small groups of demonstrators who had been unable to get to the refinery attempted to blockade the nearby Lennon's quarry which supplies material for the construction of the site.\n\nThere was political controversy in Ireland about the use of such force on a peaceful demonstration. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, leader of Fianna Fáil, said in a statement that the Irish government's position was clear in relation to the Corrib gas situation - that the negotiating is over and \"that is it\". In relation to the policing of the protests, he and the Opposition's Enda Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, would only reiterate that \"the law must be obeyed\".\n\nA further large scale protest at Bellanaboy scheduled for 24 November was cancelled by the protesters for fear of further serious injuries from Gardaí.\n\nOn 5 June, five protesters chained themselves together outside the Bord na Móna facility near Bangor Erris where Shell have been dumping the peat removed from Bellinaboy.\n\nOn 12 September, a protester charged with public order offences had her case dismissed in Belmullet because of conflicting Garda evidence. The judge dismissed most of the charges and sentenced the five protesters from June to community service for threatening and abusive behaviour. The judge also disclosed that she had received \"hate mail\".\n\nIn April 2008, a new group was set up by people formerly active in S2S. Pobal Chill Chomáin proposed moving the refinery to Glinsk, which would have removed the necessity to transport the gas near people's homes and under roads. The proposal was rejected by both Shell and the government.\n\nIn 2008, a new security firm, Integrated Risk Management Services, was brought in to defend Shell's preparations for the landfall of the raw gas pipeline. In August, S2S began training for marine protests in anticipation of the arrival of the Allseas pipe-laying ship \"Solitaire\", the biggest of its kind in the world with a collection of small boats.\nIn the meantime, a local Porturlin fisherman, Pat O'Donnell, laid 800 crab pots along the intended path of \"Solitaire\", and defended them from Shell survey boats which attempted to remove them. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stated that as both parties had licenses for their activities, they would have to sort it out between themselves. Two Irish Navy ships arrived in Broadhaven Bay to assist the Garda Water Unit in dealing with the protests. \"Solitaire\" was boarded by S2S activists in Killybegs. Not long after it arrived to Mayo's coast, the ship's company said it had suffered damage to its crane. It returned to Britain for repairs. Maura Harrington began a hunger strike to coincide with the arrival of \"Solitaire\", the Allseas pipe-laying vessel, in Broadhaven Bay. Harrington, who had recently retired as principal of the local Inver Primary School, continued her protest until the ship left Irish waters.\n\nIn March 2009, Maura Harrington was sentenced to a month in Mountjoy Prison, for assaulting a Garda at McGrath's pier. In July 2009, Niall Harnett and Maura Harrington, two leading Corrib gas activists were jailed for four months over demonstrations.\n\nIn November 2009, the Garda Ombudsman Commission recommended that disciplinary action be taken against a senior member of An Garda Síochána over the handling of the June 2007 protest. In a separate development, An Bord Pleanála found that up to half of the final section of Shell's proposed route for the onshore pipeline was ‘unacceptable’ on safety grounds.\n\nShell failed to meet An Bord Pleanala's deadline in February and applied for an extension of time to put their proposals forward as to how the project might proceed. Pat O'Donnell, from Porturlin, was sentenced to seven months imprisonment in February. In April, Niall Harnett of Kilcommon, was jailed. Little work was carried out by Shell in 2010. The film \"Pipe Down\" was a winner in the Waterford Film Festival.\n\nBrian Barrington BL in a report commissioned for Front Line Defenders found serious problems in North Mayo. On Monday 31 May 2010, Shell submitted a third revised EIS to An Bord Pleanala for a revised pipeline route.\n\nIn April 2011, it emerged that Gardaí who had just arrested two female protestors had made explicit jokes about raping them. They had inadvertently recorded themselves making the comments on a video camera they had taken from one of the women, which they later returned with the recording on it. The comments were widely criticised. In December the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld a complaint about RTÉ's television reporting of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's interim report. The report confirmed that the tape had recorded Gardaí joking about raping the women. The interim report found no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by Gardaí and no evidence of a breach of discipline. The complaint, which was upheld, stated that RTÉ's report was inaccurate, lacked fairness, objectivity and impartiality and caused the woman involved undue harm and offence.\n\nDirect actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011 and 2012. In May, 30 to 35 sections of wooden bog road were removed from their positions in the Shell site at Aughoose in a mass direct action by protestors. In June, between 400 and 500 people attended the \"Party Against the Pipe\" near the Shell compound in Aughoose, a family friendly gathering with craft workshops, music and food to mark the tenth anniversary of resistance to Shell's activities in Erris. Direct actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013.\n\nAnother gathering took place over the June bank holiday weekend. In July, Shell attempted to transport the tunnel boring machine from Dubin Port to Ballinaboy, but were met by many direct actions. Close to the compound, the oversize transport lorry drove off the road and remained stuck in the bog for several days. There were several arrests and assaults of protestors.\n\nIn September, Shell to Sea launched a new report on the location of Ireland's oil and gas reserves, which depicted all the areas of oil and gas exploration, oil and gas discoveries and commercial fields for the first time on a single map, as well as publishing the license holding companies' estimates of how much each was worth. The report, entitled 'Liquid Assets: Ireland's oil and gas resources and how they could be managed for the people's benefit', was launched by Paul Murphy, Socialist Party MEP.\n\nIn February 2013, with Shell having revealed 2012 profits of €19.6 billion, people blocked trucks on their way to the multinational corporation's tunnelling compound at Aughoose. Campaigner Terence Conway said: \"These obscene profits announced by Shell this week come at the expense of communities and the environment where Shell operate\". Campaigner Maura Harrington said: \"The Government are still willing to force suffering on the people of Ireland through severe cutbacks, yet at the same time give our oil and gas away to multinational companies such as Shell, with no benefit to country. It is time for people to demand that this situation is changed.\"\n\nThe Rossport Solidarity Camp was originally set up on ‘Rossport 5’ Philip McGrath's land in early July 2005. The site of the camp was on the proposed pipeline route. Set up at the request of local people who sought outside support in their campaign against the gas project, it houses national and international activists. In Spring 2006, the camp was set up again close to the beach at Glengad near the ‘landfall’ for Shell's proposed pipeline. Mayo County Council evicted the camp and it closed in December 2007. Since then the \"camp\" has been organised from the Rossport Solidarity House in Pollathomas. On Saturday 16 August 2008, the camp was set up afresh with two large tents. In August 2008, camp members picketed the Shell compound near the beach at Glengad. It organises informational weekends etc. In the same month they organised a beach party weekend to highlight the Glengad beach landfall site. In June 2009, about 40 Gardaí were stationed below the Camp to prevent activists from accessing either the beach or the sea.\n\nThe campaign has a diverse support base, including people from many political backgrounds and those with no strong politics at all. Local campaigners include former Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael supporters. Philip McGrath, one of the Rossport Five, was an election agent for Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny. Werner Blau, a physics professor at Trinity College, Dublin, and part-time Rossport resident, told his neighbours that the pipeline intended for Rossport would not even comply with United States standards, which he described as \"pretty lax\". In its rankings of countries' facilitation of oil and gas companies, the World Bank rates Ireland in its highest, \"very favourable\" category, along with Pakistan and Argentina. By comparison, Nigeria is rated average. Mike Cunningham, a former director of Statoil, said: \"No country in the world gives as favourable terms to the oil companies as Ireland.\" This is a result of legislation created by Ray Burke, who served as Minister of Communications and Energy.\n\nMany people from outside Erris are concerned about aspects of the proposed project leading to widespread opposition. Some specific concerns are use of compulsory orders to acquire property for private companies and over-generous terms given to the oil companies by successive Fianna Fáil governments.\n\nPeople from the Niger Delta now resident in Ireland have expressed support. A mural of Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was executed after leading a campaign to reduce Shell's influence in Ogoniland, has been painted on a gable in Rossport and a memorial to the Ogoni Nine erected.\n\nIn 2006, Shell were accused of trying to influence local business, when the owner of a local adventure centre alleged that Shell offered him €15,000 in return for his support for the construction of the pipeline in 2005. Shell said in response, that at no point was such an offer made as it was against their business principles but that Shell had given a donation of €150 to a windsurfing festival following a request by the businessman.\n\nUnsubstantiated allegations abound linking the IRA and Sinn Féin to the Shell to Sea campaign. In 2005, Michael McDowell—using Dáil privilege—claimed that Frank Connolly, an investigative journalist and a brother of one of the Colombia Three, had travelled to Colombia under a false passport. McDowell subsequently leaked the alleged faked passport application to a friend, the journalist Sam Smyth of the \"Irish Independent\", and prejudiced any potential Garda investigation. Although Connolly denied McDowell's accusations, the controversy led to Irish American private donor Chuck Feeney withdrawing funding from the Centre for Public Inquiry, an investigative organisation which of which Frank Connolly was the director had published a report on the Corrib Gas Project, embarrassing the government.\n\nStories of infiltration by political activists from outside the area and intimidation of project supporters had also been rife, but these were denied by the then independent TD Jerry Cowley and local Fine Gael TD Michael Ring. Ring originally supported S2S, though later changed his position. Gardaí also made allegations of intimidation, though no arrests were made or individuals questioned. The president of Belmullet chamber of commerce told the media that what was described as \"intimidation\" is actually boycotting of pro-Shell businesses by S2S supporters. He told \"The Irish Times\": \"It has never been anything more serious than that, but that is serious enough.\"\n\n\n"}

The French sociologist Émile Durkheim defined the term, and argued that the discipline of sociology should be understood as the empirical study of social facts. For Durkheim, social facts \"... consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him.\"\n\nIn \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" Durkheim laid out a theory of sociology as \"the science of social facts\". He considered social facts to \"consist of representations and actions\" which meant that \"they cannot be confused with organic phenomena, nor with physical phenomena, which have no existence save in and through the individual consciousness.\" Durkheim says that a social fact is a thing that many people do very similarly because the socialized community that they belong to has influenced them to do these things.\n\nDurkheim defined the social fact this way:\n\nHe viewed it as a concrete idea that affected a person's everyday life.\n\nDurkheim's examples of social facts included social institutions such as kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions with other members of our societies. Deviating from the norms of such institutions makes the individual unacceptable or misfit in the group.\n\nAmong the most noted of Durkheim's work was his discovery of the \"social fact\" of suicide rates. By carefully examining police suicide statistics in different districts, Durkheim demonstrated that the suicide rate of Catholic communities is lower than that of Protestant communities. He ascribed this to a \"social\" (as opposed to individual) cause. This was considered groundbreaking and remains influential.\n\nDurkheim's discovery of social facts was significant because it promised to make it possible to study the behaviour of entire societies, rather than just of particular individuals. Durkheim points to individual actions as instances or representations of different types of actions in society. Some contemporary, interpretivist, sociologists like Max Atkinson and Jack Douglas refer to Durkheim's studies for two quite different purposes, however:\n\n\nFor Marcel Mauss (Durkheim's nephew and sometime collaborator) a \"total social fact\" (French \"fait social total\") is \"an activity that has implications throughout society, in the economic, legal, political, and religious spheres\".\nDiverse strands of social and psychological life are woven together through what he came to call \"total social facts\". A total social fact informs and organizes seemingly quite distinct practices and institutions. Marcel Mauss popularized the term in his book, \"The Gift\":\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "993492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993492", "title": "Sociology of scientific knowledge", "text": "Sociology of scientific knowledge\n\nThe sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) is the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing with \"the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity.\" The sociology of scientific ignorance (SSI) is complementary to the sociology of scientific knowledge. For comparison, the sociology of knowledge studies the impact of human knowledge and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises.\n\nSociologists of scientific knowledge study the development of a scientific field and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of political, historical, cultural or economic factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote relativism or to attack the scientific project; the aim of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances.\n\nThe field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at Cornell University). Major theorists include Barry Barnes, David Bloor, Sal Restivo, Randall Collins, Gaston Bachelard, Harry Collins, Paul Feyerabend, Steve Fuller, Martin Kusch, Bruno Latour, Mike Mulkay, Derek J. de Solla Price, Lucy Suchman and Anselm Strauss.\n\nThe sociology of scientific knowledge in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American Robert K. Merton, generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science. Merton's was a kind of \"sociology of scientists,\" which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the later Wittgenstein. David Bloor, one of SSK's early champions, has contrasted the so-called 'weak programme' (or 'program' — either spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the 'strong programme', which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs.\n\nThe \"weak\" programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite sociological factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. Imre Lakatos and (in some moods) Thomas Kuhn might be said to adhere to it. The \"strong\" programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the 'Edinburgh School' (David Bloor, Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the University of Edinburgh) in the 1970s and '80s, and the 'Bath School' (Harry Collins and others at the University of Bath) in the same period. \"Edinburgh sociologists\" and \"Bath sociologists\" promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with Michael Mulkay at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK's relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore).\n\nThe sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America. It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics.\n\nStudies of mathematical practice and quasi-empiricism in mathematics are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge, since they focus on the community of those who practice mathematics and their common assumptions. Since Eugene Wigner raised the issue in 1960 and Hilary Putnam made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as physics and mathematics should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number-proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is nothing but a modeling of reality, and seeing causal relationships governing repeatable observed phenomena, and much of mathematics, especially in relation to the growth of the calculus, has been developed precisely for the goal of developing these models in a rigorous fashion. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as 'mathematics' and 'physics' is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish.\n\nFundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by Sal Restivo and David Bloor. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as Oswald Spengler (\"The Decline of the West\", 1918), Raymond Louis Wilder and Leslie Alvin White, as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. David Bloor draws upon Ludwig Wittgenstein and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently Paul Ernest has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists.\n\nSSK has received criticism from theorists of the Actor-network theory (ANT) school of science and technology studies. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological reductionism and a human centered universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article \"Epistemological Chicken\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "88259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88259", "title": "Splashdown", "text": "Splashdown\n\nSplashdown is the method of landing a spacecraft by parachute in a body of water. It was used by American manned spacecraft prior to the Space Shuttle program, and is planned for use by the upcoming Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle. It is also possible for the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to land in water, though this is only a contingency. The only example of an unintentional manned splashdown in Soviet history is the Soyuz 23 landing.\n\nAs the name suggests, the capsule parachutes into an ocean or other large body of water. The properties of water cushion the spacecraft enough that there is no need for a braking rocket to slow the final descent as is the case with Russian and Chinese manned space capsules, which return to Earth over land. The American practice came in part because American launch sites are on the coastline and launch primarily over water. Russian launch sites are far inland and most early launch aborts were likely to descend on land.\n\nThe splashdown method of landing was utilized for Mercury, Gemini and Apollo (including Skylab, which used Apollo capsules). On one occasion a Soviet spacecraft, Soyuz 23, unintentionally punched through the ice of a frozen lake (nearly killing the cosmonauts).\n\nOn early Mercury flights, a helicopter attached a cable to the capsule, lifted it from the water and delivered it to a nearby ship. This was changed after the sinking of \"Liberty Bell 7\". All later Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules had a flotation collar (similar to a rubber life raft) attached to the spacecraft to increase their buoyancy. The spacecraft would then be brought alongside a ship and lifted onto deck by crane.\n\nAfter the flotation collar is attached, a hatch on the spacecraft is usually opened. At that time, some astronauts decide to be hoisted aboard a helicopter for a ride to the recovery ship and some decided to stay with the spacecraft and be lifted aboard ship via crane. (Because of his overshoot aboard \"Aurora 7,\" and mindful of the fate of \"Liberty Bell 7,\" Scott Carpenter alone egressed through the nose of his capsule instead of through the hatch, waiting for recovery forces in his life raft.) All Gemini and Apollo flights (Apollos 7 to 17) used the former, while Mercury missions from Mercury 6 to Mercury 9, as well as all Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz used the latter, especially the Skylab flights as to preserve all medical data. During the Gemini and Apollo programs, NASA used for the astronauts to practice water egress.\n\nApollo 11 was America's first moon landing mission and marked the first time that humans walked on the surface of another planetary body. The possibility of the astronauts bringing \"moon germs\" back to Earth was remote, but not impossible. To contain any possible contaminants at the scene of the splashdown, the astronauts donned special Biological Isolation Garments and the outside of the suits were scrubbed prior to the astronauts being hoisted aboard and escorted safely inside a \"Mobile Quarantine Facility\".\n\nThe early design concept for the new U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle featured recovery on land using a combination of parachutes and airbags, although it was also designed to make a contingency splashdown (only for an in-flight abort) if needed. Due to weight considerations, the airbag design concept was dropped. The present design concept features landings via splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.\n\nThe most dangerous aspect is the possibility of the spacecraft flooding and sinking. For example, when the hatch of Gus Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 capsule blew prematurely, the capsule sank and Grissom almost drowned.\n\nDespite the fact that water helps cushion the spacecraft's landing to an extent, the impact can still be quite violent for the astronauts.\n\nIf the capsule comes down far from any recovery forces the crew are exposed to greater danger. As an example, Scott Carpenter in Mercury 7 overshot the assigned landing zone by . These recovery operation mishaps can be mitigated by placing several vessels on standby in several different locations, but this is quite an expensive option.\n\n\"** Planned recovery ship\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5397270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5397270", "title": "Telegony (pregnancy)", "text": "Telegony (pregnancy)\n\nTelegony is a theory in heredity, holding that offspring can inherit the characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent; thus the child of a widowed or remarried woman might partake of traits of a previous husband. \n\nWhereas experiments in the late 19th century on several species failed to provide evidence that offspring would inherit any character from their mother's previous mates, a similar phenomenon whereby environmental (non-genetic) traits were passed has been recently discovered in a species of fly.\n\nThe term was coined by August Weismann from the Greek words τῆλε (tèle) meaning 'far' and γονος (gonos) meaning 'offspring'. The name may also refer to Odysseus' son Telegonus; the lost poem named after him is \"Telegony\".\n\nThe idea of telegony goes back to Aristotle. It states that individuals can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, it was thought that paternity could be shared.\n\nThe theory, expounded as part of Aristotle's biology, was accepted throughout Antiquity. The concept of telegonic impregnation was expressed in Greek mythology in the origins of their heroes. Such double fatherhood, one immortal, one mortal, was a familiar feature of heroes such as Theseus, who was doubly conceived in the same night. By the understanding of sex in Antiquity, the mix of semen gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics. Of a supposed Parnassos, founder of Delphi, Pausanias observes, \"Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god Poseidon, the human father being Cleopompus.\" Sometimes the result could be twins such as Castor and Pollux, one born divine and one mortal.\n\nThe more general doctrine of \"maternal impressions\" was also known in Ancient Israel. The book of Genesis describes Jacob inducing goats and sheep in Laban's herds to bear striped and spotted young by placing dark wooden rods with white stripes in their watering troughs. Telegony influenced early Christianity as well. The Gnostic followers of Valentinius (circa 100–160 CE) characteristically took the concept from the physiological world into the realm of psychology and spirituality by extending the supposed influence even to the thoughts of the woman. In the Gospel of Philip, a text among those found at Nag Hammadi:\n\nWhomever the woman loves, to him those who are born are like; if her husband, they are like her husband; if an adulterer, they are like the adulterer. Often when a woman sleeps with her husband, but while her heart is with the adulterer with whom she is accustomed to unite, she bears the one whom she bears so that he is like the adulterer. \n\nThe concept of telegony was revived with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the Middle Ages. This was part of the resistance to the marriage in 1361 of Edward, the Black Prince, heir to the throne of Edward III of England, with Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, who had been previously married: their progeny, it was thought, might not be completely of his Plantagenet blood.\n\nIn the 19th century, the most widely credited example was that of Lord Morton’s mare, reported by the distinguished surgeon Sir Everard Home, and cited by Charles Darwin. Lord Morton bred a white mare with a wild quagga stallion, and when he later bred the same mare with a white stallion, the offspring strangely had stripes in the legs, like the quagga.\n\nThe Surgeon-General of New York, the physiologist Austin Flint, in his \"Text-Book of Human Physiology\" (fourth edition, 1888) described the phenomenon as follows:\n\nBoth Schopenhauer and Herbert Spencer found telegony to be a credible theory; August Weismann, on the other hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by James Cossar Ewart in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician Karl Pearson pointed out that, if telegony was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, which is not the case.\n\nBiologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare with reference to the dominant and recessive variants of a gene: both the mare and the stallion had a recessive gene; the foal inherited these alleles and thus displayed the characteristic invisible in its parents.\n\nIn mammals, each sperm has the haploid set of chromosomes and each egg has another haploid set. During the process of fertilization a zygote with the diploid set is produced. This set will be inherited by every somatic cell of a mammal, with exactly half the genetic material coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of telegony is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of genetics and the reproductive process. Encyclopædia Britannica stated \"All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions.\"\n\nTelegony, once a popular theory among nineteenth century biologists, was largely dismissed with the arrival of Mendelian genetics. However, in 2014 the evolutionary ecologists A. J. Crean and colleagues reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly, \"Telostylinus angusticollis\".\nY. S. Liu has proposed possible molecular mechanisms that may account for telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-Mendelian breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal somatic cells, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated non-Mendelian inheritance of epigenetic changes.\n\nTelegony influenced late 19th-century racialist beliefs. A woman who had a child with a non-Aryan man, it was argued, could never have a \"pure\" Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the National Socialist German Workers Party.\n\nTelegony re-emerged within post-Soviet Russian Orthodoxy. \"Virginity and Telegony: The Orthodox church and modern science of genetic inversions\" was published in 2004. Pravda.ru gave an overview of the concept and a brief review of the book, saying that the authors invented \"scary and incredible stories\" to \"make women be very careful about their sexual contacts\" and that the idea was being used by the Church to scare the faithful. Anna Kuznetsova, who was appointed Children's Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation in 2016, had said several years earlier that she believes in the concept, amongst other fringe views. The founding editor of the business newspaper \"Vedomosti\" interpreted the appointment of someone with such views as a sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin was becoming more ideological.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40705460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40705460", "title": "Tonti diagram", "text": "Tonti diagram\n\nThe Tonti diagram, created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: \"particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,\" and \"irreversible thermodynamics\". The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.\n\nThe starting point of this classification stems from a remark by Maxwell. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:\n\nOf the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.\n\nThis remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors E and H are associated with lines, and vectors D and B are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their \"association\" with space elements. \nMaxwell continues:\n\nIt is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.\n\nThe classification diagram arises from an analysis of the \"association\" of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.\n\nPhysics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the quantitative attributes of physical systems and from these originate the physical quantities, which can be scalars, vectors, tensors, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: physical variables, physical parameters and fundamental constants.\n\nThe term space-global variables refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the \"global\" variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the \"global\" variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the \"global\" variable and strain the line density.\nThe very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are \"associated\" with volumes, surfaces and lines.\nEvery density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the \"associated\" space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a field variable. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them integral variables.\nIntegral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are \"associated\" with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of \"integral variables\".\n\nThe term time-global variables is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.\n\nThe physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the \"configuration\" of a system or a field, those describing the \"source\" of a phenomenon or a field, and finally \"energy\" variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called configuration variables. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called source variables. The third category, that of energy variables, is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.\nThe fundamental problem of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).\n\nBy the term \"space elements\" we intend points, lines, surfaces and volumes, which are denoted P,L,S and V respectively.\nBy the term \"time elements\" we intend time instants and time intervals, which are denoted I and T respectively.\nSpace elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.\n\nAll fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux) make reference to a surface (S), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line (L) and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume (V). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point (P).\n\nA similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is \"associated\" with a time interval (T), whereas a position vector is \"associated\" with a time instant (I). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is \"referred\" to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be \"associated\" with a time interval (T). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a mechanical equilibrium to be reached, hence it is \"associated\" with a time interval (T).\n\nSince in each field of physics the global variables are \"associated\" with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to \"inherit\" the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have performed the limit to obtain the field variables.\n\nIn this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: inner and outer orientation, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThere is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that \"the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.\"\n\nTo highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a cell complex. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.\nEach of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the dual complex, obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the primal complex. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.\n\nA cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.\n\nAt first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. \nConsidering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called \"primal\" and the second \"dual\".\nPrimal complex, inner orientation: the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.\nSince the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t), in order to conceive the \"+\" and \"-\" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as \"sinks\".\n\nDual complex, outer orientation: the middle instant of each time interval is called \"dual time instant\" and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called \"outer\" orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called \"dual time intervals\". Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called \"outer\" orientation of the dual time intervals.\n\nThe fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. \nLet us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the \"configuration\" variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the \"source\" variables.\n\nThe equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are \"balance\" equations, \"circuital\" equations and \"gradient-forming\" equations. They have a topological structure and are called topological equations. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are \"material\" or \"constitutive\" equations, and belong to the category of phenomenological equations.\n\nParticle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.\n\nSince every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements. \nWhen the four space elements P, L, S and V are coupled with the two time elements I and T we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.\nThe first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.\n\nThe space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.\n\n\nDiscrete Physics\n\nChronological Tables of famous people\n\nResearch gate\n"}

Some subterranean fiction involves traveling to the Earth's center and finding either a Hollow Earth or Earth's molten core.\n\nPlanetary scientist David J. Stevenson suggested sending a probe to the core as a thought experiment. Humans have drilled over 12 kilometers (7.67 miles) in the Sakhalin-I. In terms of depth below the surface, the Kola Superdeep Borehole SG-3 retains the world record at in 1989 and still is the deepest artificial point on Earth.\n\nThe idea of a so-called \"Hollow Earth\", once popular in fantasy adventure literature, is that the planet Earth has a hollow interior and an inner surface habitable by human beings. Although the scientific community has made clear that this is pseudoscience, the idea nevertheless is a less popular feature of many fantasy and science fiction stories and of some conspiracy theories.\n\nThe most famous example of a hollow-Earth fantasy is Jules Verne's 1864 science-fiction novel \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\", which has been adapted many times as a feature film and for television.\n\nThe 2003 film \"The Core\", loosely based on the novel \"Core\", tells the story of a team that has to drill to the center of the Earth and detonate a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of Earth's core. The drilling equipment, dubbed \"Virgil\", includes a powerful, snake-like laser drill, a small nuclear reactor for power, a shell (of \"unobtainium\", a fictional material) to protect against intense heat and pressure (and generate energy to drive the engine), a powerful x-ray camera for viewing outside, and a system of impellers for movement and control. The only part of the Earth that turns out to be hollow is a gigantic geode, and soon after the drill moves through it, the hole it created fills with magma.\n\nThe 1986 animated television show Inhumanoids featured regular visits to the Inner Core in most of its 13 episodes. Each of the three villainous creatures theoretically ruled over certain layers of the inner earth, and their evil schemes were thwarted by the human Earth Corps, who often allied with various races of subterranean beings equally threatened by the Inhumanoids.\n\nDuring season 3 of the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" cartoon, the Technodrome is located at the Earth's core, and transport modules are used to drill up to the streets. This season also features the episode \"Turtles at the Earth's Core\", where a dinosaur lives in a deep cave, and a crystal of energy that works like the Sun to keep the dinosaurs alive.\nAs Krang, Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady steal the crystal to power the Technodrome, the trouble begins.\n\nDon Rosa's 1995 \"Uncle Scrooge\" story \"The Universal Solvent\" imagines a way to travel to the planet's core using 1950s technology, although this would be impossible in reality. The fictional solvent referred to in the story's title has the power to condense everything except diamonds into a kind of super-dense dust. The solvent is accidentally spilled and, as it dissolves everything in its path, it bores a cylindrical shaft into the center of the planet. As part of a recovery effort, a makeshift platform is constructed that descends into the shaft in free fall, automatically deploying an electric motor and wheels as it approaches zero gravity, then using rocket engines to enable it to ascend again to the Earth's surface. The author Rosa describes this fantasy journey in great detail: the supposed structure of the Earth is illustrated, and the shaft is kept in a vacuum to protect against the lethal several thousand kilometers of atmosphere that it would otherwise be exposed to. The ducks must wear space suits and go without food for several days, and they are not entirely certain that the super-dense heat shield will hold. The author maintains continuity with Carl Barks, explaining that the earthquakes in the story are created by spherical Fermies and Terries.\n\nIn Tales to Astonish #2 (1959) \"I Fell to the Center of the Earth\", an archaeologist named Dr. Burke who is on an expedition to Asia travels to the center of the Earth (and also, as he later finds out, backwards in time)--and encounters neanderthals and dinosaurs.\n\nIn the Doctor Who episode, \"The Runaway Bride\", a Racnoss warship is found at the center of the planet.\n\n\n"}

The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also possesses oversight of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, created under 31 USC 311, [one of sixteen agencies in the United States Intelligence Community per 50 USC 3003]. The Federal Reserve remains outside the jurisdiction of this office, and cannot be investigated by it..\n\nThe position's predecessor, the Under Secretary for Enforcement, managed law enforcement aspects of the Department prior to the reorganization. The Under Secretary for Enforcement provided oversight and policy guidance for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the U.S. Secret Service, the Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Under Secretary also provided policy guidance over the Internal Revenue Service's Crime Investigation.\n\nSeveral of these agencies are now non-existent or have been moved into other federal departments. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was split into two separate bureaus, with one handling certain law enforcement aspects and the other handling tax collection aspects. The former was moved into the United States Department of Justice, while the latter was kept within the Department of the Treasury. The U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center are now within the Department of Homeland Security. The U.S. Customs Service was moved into the Department of Homeland Security when it became part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. However, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 Custom Service's \"revenue functions\" were retained by Treasury. This includes, among others, Customs duties, enforcing trade agreements, and counterfeit trademark detection and seizure.\n\nFormer Under Secretaries of include Jimmy Gurule, James Johnson, Raymond Kelly, Ronald Noble, Stuart Levy, and David Cohen.

The WCA is done in three steps, a global analysis of water distribution and consumption in the network, establishing baseline minimum water targets and redesign of the water network to achieve these targets.\n\nWCA was first introduced by Manan, Tan and Foo in 2004. Since then, it has been widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants. A Time dependent water cascade analysis was presented later on. A variation of the WCA is the gas cascade analysis (GCA).\n\n"}
