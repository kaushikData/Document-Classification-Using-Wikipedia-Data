{"id": "25109774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25109774", "title": "Afterwardsness", "text": "Afterwardsness\n\nIn the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud, afterwardsness is a \"mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution of sexual or traumatic meaning to earlier events... [from the German word] \"Nachträglichkeit\", translated as deferred action, retroaction, , afterwardsness\". As summarized by another scholar, 'In one sense, Freud's theory of deferred action can be simply stated: memory is reprinted, so to speak, in accordance with later experience'.\n\nThe psychoanalytical concept of \"afterwardsness\" () appeared initially in Freud's writings in the 1890s in the commonsense form of the German adjective-adverb \"afterwards\" or \"deferred\" (\"nachträglich\"): as Freud wrote in the unfinished and unpublished \"A Project for a Scientific Psychology\" of 1895, 'a memory is repressed which has only become a trauma \"after the event\" '. However the 'theory of deferred action had already been [publicly] put forward by Freud in the \"Studies on Hysteria\" (1895)', and in a paper of 1896 'he elaborates on the idea of \"deferred action\": the pathogenic effect of a traumatic event occurring in childhood...[manifesting] retrospectively when the child reaches a subsequent phase of sexual development'.\n\nThe same idea would feature prominently a couple of decades later in his study of the \"Wolf Man\": 'The effects of the scene were deferred, but...had the same effect as though it were a recent experience'. 'Thus although he never offered a definition, much less a general theory, of the notion of deferred action, it was indisputably looked on by Freud as part of his conceptual equipment'.\n\nIt was Lacan who brought the term back from obscurity after Freud's death—his translation in the French language as the \"\" fits into the context of his \"return to Freud\" (\"rapport de Rome\", 1953)—and certainly French psychoanalysis has since taken the lead in its explication. Lacan himself claimed in his Seminar that \"the real implication of the \"nachträglich\", for example, has been ignored, though it was there all the time and had only to be picked up,\" while writing in Ecrits of \"'deferred action' (\"Nachtrag\"), to rescue another of these terms from the facility into which they have since fallen...they were unheard of at that time.\"\n\nAfter Lacan's \"après-coup\", Jean Laplanche’s contribution to the concept of the afterwardsness signifies something very different: with Jean Laplanche and in the relation to Freud (theory of the seduction, \"neurotica\"), Lacan's \"Other\" loses its capital letter of the \"Symbolic\", that links Lacan to French structuralism (Saussure's linguistics, Lévi-Strauss's ethnology), and that links also Lacan \"afterwards\" in the history of the ideas (from the 1960s on)—by \"inversion in the opposite direction\" (a \"destiny of the drive\" in psychoanalytic theory)—to the at the place of Jacques Derrida's deconstruction.\n\n\"Afterwardsness\" becomes the key concept in Laplanche’s \"theory of the general seduction\" (\"\") and of the corresponding importance of 'the act of \"psychic translation\"... of [enigmatic] deposits by the other'—an approach which develops further Freud's letter 52/112 (to Wilhelm Fliess). In his \"Notes on Afterwardsness\" (1992), based on a conversation of Jean Laplanche with Martin Stanton, there is an excellent definition of \"afterwardsness\" in Laplanche's sense, including the category of the \"enigmatic message\", that highlights Laplanche's contribution to Freud's concept:\nClosely related for Freud to deferred action was deferred obedience: again, 'a \"deferred\" effect...a \"deferred obedience\" under the influence of repression'. Thus for instance Freud explored the different phases of a man's infantile attitude to his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a neurosis based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.\n\nIn \"Totem and Taboo\" he generalised the principle and 'depicted the social contract also as based on posthumous obedience to the father's authority'—offset at times by its converse, occasional Carnival-like licence such as 'the memorial festival of the totem meal, in which the \"restrictions\" of deferred obedience no longer held'.\n\n"}

Although the Akhdams are Arabic-speaking Muslims just like any other Yemeni, they are considered to be at the very bottom of the supposedly abolished caste ladder, are socially segregated, and are mostly confined to menial jobs in the country's major cities. According to official estimates, the Akhdam numbered between 500,000 and 3,500,000 individuals.\n\nThe exact origins of Al-Akhdam are uncertain. One popular belief holds that they are descendants of Nilotic Sudanese people who accompanied the Abyssinian army during the latter's occupation of Yemen in the pre-Islamic period. Once the Abyssinian troops were finally expelled at the start of the Muslim era, some of the Sudanese migrants are said to have remained behind, giving birth to the Akhdam people. This belief, however, was denied and described as a myth by Hamud al-Awdi, a professor of sociology at Sana University.\n\nAnthropologists such as Vombruck postulate that Yemen's history and social hierarchy that developed under various regimes, including the Zaydi Imamate, had created a hereditary caste-like society. Till today, the Al-Akhdam people exists at the very bottom of Yemeni social strata.\n\nThe Al-Akhdam community suffers from extreme discrimination, persecution, and social exclusion from the mainstream Yemeni society. The contempt for the Akhdam people is expressed by a traditional Yemeni proverb: \"Clean your plate if it is touched by a dog, but break it if it's touched by a Khadem.″Though their social conditions have improved somewhat in modern times, Al-Akhdam are still stereotyped by mainstream Yemeni society; they have been called lowly, dirty and immoral. Intermarriages between the conventional Yemeni society with the Akhdam community are taboo and virtually prohibited, as the Al-Akhdam are deemed as untouchables. Men who do marry into the community risk banishment by their families.\n\nIn the face of extreme societal discrimination, the Al-Akhdam people are forced to work menial and dirty jobs such as sweeping, shoe-making and the cleaning of latrines, vocations for which they are still known to this day. Those who are unemployed, most of whom are women, usually resort to begging.\n\nEven the Akhdam people who are employed are not spared from discrimination. Akhdam street sweepers are rarely granted contracts even after decades of work, despite the fact that all Yemeni civil servants are supposed to be granted contracts after six months. They receive no benefits, and almost no time off.\n\nThe Akhdam reside in slum districts that are generally isolated from the rest of Yemeni society. It is hardly possible for the Akhdam people to afford shelter with even the most basic amenities such as electricity, running water and sewage system. Accordingly, Akhdam generally live in small huts haphazardly built of wood and cloth.\n\nDue to poverty and the unsanitary living conditions, the Akhdam people are vulnerable to preventable diseases. The death rates from preventable diseases are worse than the nationwide average in Yemen. Many Al-Akhdam children suffer from diseases such as dyspnoea, malaria and polio, and the death rate is high. The reported infant mortality rate is also described as \"appalling\". Out of the deaths reported in an Akhdam shantytown over a year, about a half were children under the age of 5, a quarter of whom were in the first month of life.\n\nStudies by Al-Serouri et al. further report a poorer understanding of HIV risks amongst the Al-Akhdam community. Accordingly, group members also have higher reported rates and risks of contracting HIV infections.\n\nMany NGOs and charitable organizations from other countries such as CARE International are reportedly working toward improving the living circumstances of the Akhdam. Such initiatives include the building of a chicken farm, sanitation projects, the provision of electricity and classes aimed at eradicating illiteracy. The extent of these efforts, however, is disputed, most notably by Huda Sief. Government corruption also means that monetary aid intended for the Akhdam is often misused or stolen.\n\nGovernment officials, while admitting an historical disdain for the Akhdam among conventional Yemeni society, insist that there is no official discrimination. The Yemeni government has occasionally built shelters for the Akhdam, although it is reported that 30% of Akhdam who received such state housing sold it, choosing instead to return to their original neighborhoods. Despite the supposed absence of official discrimination, many Akhdam claim that officials often block their attempts to seek state services at schools and hospitals.\n\nA significant step forward was achieved with the formation of a political party to represent them and possibly alleviate their conditions. The Yemeni revolt in 2011 had also roused many Akhdam people to participate in the uprising by appearing regularly in the demonstrations and sit-ins that filled the mains squares of the capital city Sanaa and Taiz. Many had hoped that the revolt would help end the cycle of racism that has placed them at the bottom of the social ladder.\n\nMost Al-Akhdam live in segregated slums on the outskirts of Yemen's main urban centers. Many of them reside in the capital Sana'a. Others can also be found in Aden, Ta'izz, Lahij, Abyan, Al Hudaydah and Mukalla.\n\nAccording to official estimates, the Akhdam numbered around 500,000 individuals in 2004. Other estimates put their number at over 3.5 million residents in 2013, out of a total Yemeni population of around 22 million.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2210835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2210835", "title": "Attentional blink", "text": "Attentional blink\n\nAttentional blink (AB) is a phenomenon that reflects the temporal costs in allocating selective attention. \nThe AB is typically measured by using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, where participants often fail to detect a second salient target occurring in succession if it is presented between 180-450 ms after the first one. Also, the AB has been observed using two backward-masked targets and auditory stimuli. The term attentional blink was first used in 1992, although the phenomenon was probably known before.\nThe precise adaptive significance behind the attentional blink is unknown, but it is thought to be a product of a two-stage visual processing system attempting to allocate episodic context to targets. In this two-stage system, all stimuli are processed to some extent by an initial parallel stage, and only salient ones are selected for in-depth processing, in order to make optimum use of limited resources at a late serial stage.\n\nOne curious aspect of attentional blink is that it usually includes \"lag 1 sparing\", meaning that targets presented \"very\" close together in time (at \"lag 1\" or consecutively in the RSVP stream) are not affected by the attentional blink, even though items presented at slightly greater lags are significantly impaired. In attentional blink, participants in experiments have trouble reporting multiple targets that are in succession to one another, and will only report one accurately when these targets are presented to them 200ms to 500ms apart according to a study by Visser et al. (2015) . These targets are denoted as T1, T2, etc. The phenomena lag-1 sparing refers to the performance of T2 as opposed to what precedes it, T1. T2 performance was originally hypothesized to be reported far less often and less accurately by participants than T1, because the attention of the participant would still be on T1 while T2 was presented immediately afterwards. Visser also thought that the participants would be too focussed on finding the first target that they would miss the second target completely. However, participants actually did better identifying T2 than they were at identifying T1 when the targets were separated by one or two distractors, denoted also as lags.\n\nA possible explanation for lag-1 sparing is that this phenomenon is heavily interconnected with attentional blink, but does not operate on the same cognitive mechanisms and requires different stimuli to occur. Specifically, for lag-1 sparing to occur, it needs visual input as practice targets. These targets can be numbers or letters presented in rapid succession. When the first target, T1, is presented, it creates an attentional window because of its novelty, meaning that it attracts and holds more attention by the participant. The novelty that wears off between T1 and T2 creates a “boost” in attention and opens a metaphorical window for faster cognition. Participants now know what and how to look for targets, so they find targets more quickly. This attentional widow remains open long enough for T2 to be presented and processed at a much higher rate because of shared characteristics to T1. Targets are normally presented in less than .5 of a second from each other. Lag-1 sparing also occurred regardless of how information was visually presented. Of two RSVP streams— where T1 location was known in the first stream and unknown in the second stream, lag-1 sparing occurred whether T2 was in the same stream as T1, or in a different stream than T1.\n\nThere is as yet no conclusive explanation for the phenomenon of lag 1 sparing, although it is thought to be related to the first parallel stage of the two-stage system of stimulus selection and processing.\n\nAccording to the LC-NE hypothesis, when a salient, or meaningful stimulus is presented, neurons in the locus coeruleus release norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that benefits the detection of the stimulus. The effect of this release lasts for 100 ms after the salient stimulus is presented and benefits the second target when presented immediately after the first one, accounting for lag 1 sparing. Eventually the neurons in the locus coeruleus enter a refractory period, due to the auto-inhibitory effect of norepinephrine. According to the hypothesis, targets presented during this refractory period cannot trigger a release of norepinephrine, resulting in the attentional blink. The episodic distinctiveness hypothesis of the ST2 model suggests that the attentional blink reflects a limitation of the visual system attempting to allocate unique episodic contexts to the ephemeral target stimuli presented in RSVP.\n\nThe attentional blink can be moderated by changes in visual similarity between targets and distractor stimuli, but it can also be affected by \"conceptual\" similarities, suggesting that stimuli are processed to quite a deep level preconsciously, with much of the resulting information discarded before it reaches consciousness.\n\nThe attentional blink is related to, but distinct from the phenomenon of repetition blindness.\n\nAttentional Blink can be used in other studies and experiments as a way to measure attention. A study conducted by Morrison et al. 2015 used AB to measure attentional differences in people with mental disorders such as depression and social anxiety disorder. Measuring AB in the subjects was effective in showing that subjects with those disorders have more difficulty recognizing T2 than others. Another study used the magnitude of AB in order to see whether positive moods affected temporal attention.\n\nWhen AB is tested, most often the stimuli presented are inanimate objects. But research shows that not only do inanimate stimuli effect AB but human faces do as well. Despite the hypothesis that configural and featural information are processed by separate channels, thus avoiding AB, human faces in all different configurations, are still processed and affected by AB.\n\nAn important factor which influences the AB is the role of emotions. Research has shown that when the second target (T2) in RSVP is an emotionally relevant stimulus it is more likely to be perceived during the attentional blink. The attentional blink is not only modulated by emotional relevance of (T2) but also by the emotional relevance of (T1). In short: when (T1) is emotionally relevant the AB is lengthened, when (T2) is emotionally relevant then the AB is reduced. This research suggests that emotion mediates attention.\n\nThe sex of the stimuli presented also influences the AB. In a study, it was shown that emotions that are more often than not prescribed to different sexes, were more quickly identified. Not only that, but when the attentional blink would occur, whether it be at lag 1 or lag 2, and how deep of a blink it was, could be manipulated by the sex of and the emotion expressed by T1.\n\nThere have also been studies using images as emotional stimuli. Emotionally negative pictures preceding the target by 2 items were found to induce greater deficits in processing the target stimuli than neutral pictures did. Thus, it seems that emotional information can elicit attentional biases which temporarily prevent awareness of actively sought out stimuli.\n\nA study conducted by Heleen Slagter, Richard Davidson and colleagues, suggests that meditation, particularly vipassana, may reduce the duration of attentional blink. In an experiment, 17 people received three months of intensive training in meditation. Those 17 along with 23 meditation novices performed an attention task in which they successively picked out two numbers embedded in a series of letters. The novices exhibited attentional blink and missed the second number. In contrast, all the trained meditators consistently picked out both numbers. This indicated meditation practice can improve focus.\n\nRaymond et al. (1992) suggest that the attentional blink is produced by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They suggest that this confusion happens at some point in the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn’t observed. The researchers also suggested that one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.\n\nShapiro et al. (1994) suggest that an interference model may better explain the attentional blink effects than the inhibition model. In this model, the attentional blink is thought to take place because of an out of place item which is selected out of the series because of the interference within the items in the series. Shapiro proposes that the amount of interference increases or decreases with the length of the series.\n\nGiesbrecht and Di Lollo (1998) suggest that the attentional blink over target 2 results when the person is busy processing target 1. It is suggested that anything increasing the difficulty of processing of the first target will result in a greater attentional blink.\n\nDuncan et al. (1996) suggest that the target 1 takes over parts of our attentional capacity, leading to a deficit of processing or recognizing target 2 when presented immediately after target 1. This theory suggests that the time for which target 1 continues to occupy attentional capacity is related directly to the difficulty of processing target 2.\n\nChun & Potter (1995) suggest that quickly processing a series of items requires two back to back stages. The first stage is the initial rapid-detection. Here, the possible targets are noticed. The second stage is the capacity-limited in which items are taken in order to report later. Stage 2 occurs after the acknowledgement of targets in Stage 1. Here, stage 2 must finishing processing target 1, until then, target 2 will not be recognized in stage 2. If there is a situation where the second target comes in the first stage, the highway to stage two is delayed. Attentional blinking occurs when the second target is in stage 1 which causes a delay. The attentional blink mirror a restriction in the process of combining information from an unstable representation to a stable representation (Johnson & Proctor, 2004).\n\n\n"}

Blocking and its inverse, unblocking, may be implemented by the owners of computers using software. Some countries, including China and Singapore, block access to certain news information. In the United States, the Children's Internet Protection Act requires schools receiving federal funded discount rates for Internet access to install filter software that blocks obscene content, pornography, and, where applicable, content \"harmful to minors\".\n\nBlocking may also refer to denying access to a web server based on the IP address of the client machine. In certain websites, including social networks such as Facebook or editable databases like Wikimedia projects and other wikis, users can apply blocks (based in either IP number or account) on other users deemed undesirable to prevent them from performing certain actions. Blocks of this kind may occur for several reasons and produce different effects: in social networks, users can unrestrictedly block other users, typically by preventing them from sending messages or viewing the blocker's information or profile. Privileged users can apply blocks that affect the access of the undesirables to the entire website.\n\nBlocking is used by moderators and administrators of social media and forums to deny access to users that have broken their rules and will likely do so again, in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly discussion place. Common reasons for blocking are spamming, trolling, and flaming. Some criticize cases of the use of bans by administrators of large websites, such as Twitter, saying that these bans may be politically or financially motivated. However, websites have a legal right to decide who is allowed to post, and users often respond by \"voting with their feet\" and going to a place where the administrators see their behavior as acceptable.\n\nBlocked users may be completely unable to access all or part of a site's content, which is usually the case when censoring or filtering mechanisms are responsible for the block. Under a stealth ban, a user is given the false impression that their content is still being posted to the site, when in reality it is being hidden from all other users.\n\nBan evasion is the act of attempting to get around a ban, whether temporary or permanent, on a website.\n\nAlternate accounts set up by people evading bans from websites are referred to as sockpuppets. Typically, if someone is caught evading a ban with a sockpuppet, the sockpuppet account is banned. If the original ban was temporary, it may be extended or even made permanent. Sometimes, the user's IP address may be banned as well so the user cannot access the site or create new accounts. Some sites may remove all but a few traces of the ban-evader. TV Tropes and Wikipedia, for example, may mass-delete any pages created by a ban-evader.\n\nBan evasion can be detected by tracing a user's IP address. If two accounts are using the same IP address, it could be a sign of ban evasion. Also, the use of a VPN, shown by rapid, drastic changes of IP address by the same user in a short period of time, can also be a sign that the user was trying to get around a ban. Ban evasion can also be spotted if posts or other contributions from two accounts look the same or similar, or on sites where the same email can be associated with multiple accounts, identical or similar emails can be a sign of ban evasion. Users who have been permanently banned for ban evasion may not be able to appeal their ban, which is the case on sites such as TV Tropes.\n\nWhen creating sockpuppets, ban evaders use a variety of tactics to disguise the fact that the new account was created by a previously banned user, such as using new names, an alternate email address, VPNs or proxy servers to mask their IP address, changing their IP address (sometimes only needing to rely on a dynamic IP address to automatically change it after a time), or using the site from public Internet access locations such as schools and libraries.\n\n"}

The requirement of a local product structure rests on the bundle having a topology. Without this requirement, more general objects can be considered bundles. For example, one can consider a bundle π: \"E\"→ \"B\" with \"E\" and \"B\" sets. It is no longer true that the preimages formula_1 must all look alike, unlike fiber bundles where the fibers must all be isomorphic (in the case of vector bundles) and homeomorphic.\n\nA bundle is a triple where are sets and a map.\n\nThis definition of a bundle is quite unrestrictive. For instance, the empty function defines a bundle. Nonetheless it serves well to introduce the basic terminology, and every type of bundle has the basic ingredients of above with restrictions on and usually there is additional structure.\n\nFor each is the fibre or fiber of the bundle over .\n\nA bundle is a subbundle of if and .\n\nA cross section is a map such that for each , that is, .\n\n\nMore generally, bundles or bundle objects can be defined in any category: in a category C, a bundle is simply an epimorphism π: \"E\" → \"B\". If the category is not concrete, then the notion of a preimage of the map is not necessarily available. Therefore these bundles may have no fibers at all, although for sufficiently well behaved categories they do; for instance, for a category with pullbacks and a terminal object 1 the points of \"B\" can be identified with morphisms \"p\":1→\"B\" and the fiber of \"p\" is obtained as the pullback of \"p\" and π. The category of bundles over \"B\" is a subcategory of the slice category (C↓\"B\") of objects over \"B\", while the category of bundles without fixed base object is a subcategory of the comma category (\"C\"↓\"C\") which is also the functor category C², the category of morphisms in C.\n\nThe category of smooth vector bundles is a bundle object over the category of smooth manifolds in Cat, the category of small categories. The functor taking each manifold to its tangent bundle is an example of a section of this bundle object.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "79373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79373", "title": "Caduceus", "text": "Caduceus\n\nThe caduceus (☤; ; Latin \"cādūceus\", from Greek ' \"herald's wand, or staff\") is the staff carried by Hermes in Greek mythology and consequently by Hermes Trismegistus in Greco-Egyptian mythology. The same staff was also borne by heralds in general, for example by Iris, the messenger of Hera. It is a short staff entwined by two serpents, sometimes surmounted by wings. In Roman iconography, it was often depicted being carried in the left hand of Mercury, the messenger of the gods, guide of the dead, and protector of merchants, shepherds, gamblers, liars, and thieves.\n\nSome accounts suggest that the oldest known imagery of the caduceus have their roots in a Mesopotamian origin with the Sumerian god Ningishzida whose symbol, a staff with two snakes intertwined around it, dates back to 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C.\n\nAs a symbolic object, it represents Hermes (or the Roman Mercury), and by extension trades, occupations, or undertakings associated with the god. In later Antiquity, the caduceus provided the basis for the astrological symbol representing the planet Mercury. Thus, through its use in astrology, alchemy, and astronomy it has come to denote the planet and elemental metal of the same name. It is said the wand would wake the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. If applied to the dying, their death was gentle; if applied to the dead, they returned to life.\n\nBy extension of its association with Mercury and Hermes, the caduceus is also a recognized symbol of commerce and negotiation, two realms in which balanced exchange and reciprocity are recognized as ideals. This association is ancient, and consistent from the Classical period to modern times. The caduceus is also used as a symbol representing printing, again by extension of the attributes of Mercury (in this case associated with writing and eloquence).\n\nThe caduceus is often incorrectly used as a symbol of healthcare organizations and medical practice, particularly in North America, due to confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the Rod of Asclepius, which has only one snake and is never depicted with wings.\n\nIt is thought that this symbol's long lasting association with the medical profession stems from early use of twigs to draw out long bodied inter muscular parasitic worms by wrapping them slowly around the twig so as not to break them or allow them to escape back into the body, a successful treatment still in use today, see Dracunculiasis.\n\nThe term \"kerukeion\" denoted any herald's staff, not necessarily associated with Hermes in particular.\n\nIn his study of the cult of Hermes, Lewis Richard Farnell (1909) assumed that the two snakes had simply developed out of ornaments of the shepherd's crook used by heralds as their staff. This view has been rejected by later authors pointing to parallel iconography in the Ancient Near East. It has been argued that the staff or wand entwined by two snakes was itself representing a god in the pre-anthropomorphic era. Like the herm or priapus, it would thus be a predecessor of the anthropomorphic Hermes of the classical era.\nWilliam Hayes Ward (1910) discovered that symbols similar to the classical caduceus sometimes appeared on Mesopotamian cylinder seals. He suggested the symbol originated some time between 3000 and 4000 BC, and that it might have been the source of the Greek caduceus. A.L. Frothingham incorporated Dr. Ward's research into his own work, published in 1916, in which he suggested that the prototype of Hermes was an \"Oriental deity of Babylonian extraction\" represented in his earliest form as a snake god. From this perspective, the caduceus was originally representative of Hermes himself, in his early form as the Underworld god Ningishzida, \"messenger\" of the \"Earth Mother\".\nThe caduceus is mentioned in passing by Walter Burkert as \"really the image of copulating snakes taken over from Ancient Near Eastern tradition\".\n\nIn Egyptian iconography, the Djed pillar is depicted as containing a snake in a frieze of the Dendera Temple complex.\n\nThe caduceus also appears as a symbol of the punch-marked coins of the Maurya Empire in India, in the third or second century BC. Numismatic research suggest that this symbol was the symbol of the Buddhist king Ashoka, his personal \"Mudra\". This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the three arched-hill symbol, the \"peacock on the hill\", the triskelis and the Taxila mark.\n\nThe Homeric hymn to Hermes relates how Hermes offered his lyre fashioned from a tortoise shell as compensation for the cattle he stole from his half brother Apollo. Apollo in return gave Hermes the caduceus as a gesture of friendship.\nThe association with the serpent thus connects Hermes to Apollo, as later the serpent was associated with Asclepius, the \"son of Apollo\".\n\nThe association of Apollo with the serpent is a continuation of the older Indo-European dragon-slayer motif. Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher (1913) pointed out that the serpent as an attribute of both Hermes and Asclepius is a variant of the \"pre-historic semi-chthonic serpent hero known at Delphi as Python\", who in classical mythology is slain by Apollo.\n\nOne Greek myth of origin of the caduceus is part of the story of Tiresias, who found two snakes copulating and killed the female with his staff. Tiresias was immediately turned into a woman, and so remained until he was able to repeat the act with the male snake seven years later. This staff later came into the possession of the god Hermes, along with its transformative powers.\n\nAnother myth suggests that Hermes (or Mercury) saw two serpents entwined in mortal combat. Separating them with his wand he brought about peace between them, and as a result the wand with two serpents came to be seen as a sign of peace.\n\nIn Rome, Livy refers to the \"caduceator\" who negotiated peace arrangements under the diplomatic protection of the caduceus he carried.\n\nIn some vase paintings ancient depictions of the Greek \"kerukeion\" are somewhat different from the commonly seen modern representation. These representations feature the two snakes atop the staff (or rod), crossed to create a circle with the heads of the snakes resembling horns. This old graphic form, with an additional crossbar to the staff, seems to have provided the basis for the graphical sign of Mercury (☿) used in Greek astrology from Late Antiquity.\n\nCaduceus is encoded in Unicode at code point U+2624: ☤.\n\nA simplified variant of the caduceus is to be found in dictionaries, indicating a “commercial term” entirely in keeping with the association of Hermes with commerce. In this form the staff is often depicted with two winglets attached and the snakes are omitted (or reduced to a small ring in the middle). The Customs Service of the former German Democratic Republic employed the caduceus, bringing its implied associations with thresholds, translators, and commerce, in the service medals they issued their staff. The caduceus is also the symbol of the Customs Agency of Bulgaria. The emblem of the China Customs is a caduceus crossing with a golden key.\n\n\n"}

An example of its use is in club rugby and cricket competitions in Australia where clubs may have several grades.\n\nA club championship is useful because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength against another, rather than merely looking at, for example, first grade results. Because it allows a comparison of the entire club's strength, club championships are often used where there is a promotion/relegation system in place.\n\nThis means that a club which is strong throughout the grades will be in a better position than one which has only one or two strong teams. In a club championship system each grade's results are weighted, with the higher grades receiving more points, preventing clubs from flooding their lower grades with top players at the end of a season and shoring up their club championship results.\n\n"}

{"id": "6620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6620", "title": "Cotangent space", "text": "Cotangent space\n\nIn differential geometry, one can attach to every point \"x\" of a smooth (or differentiable) manifold a vector space called the cotangent space at \"x\". Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at \"x\", although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors.\n\nAll cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same dimension, equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be \"glued together\" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the cotangent bundle of the manifold.\n\nThe tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a Riemannian metric or a symplectic form gives rise to a natural isomorphism between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.\n\nLet \"M\" be a smooth manifold and let \"x\" be a point in \"M\". Let \"T\"\"M\" be the tangent space at \"x\". Then the cotangent space at \"x\" is defined as the dual space of \"T\"\"M\":\nConcretely, elements of the cotangent space are linear functionals on \"T\"\"M\". That is, every element α ∈ \"T\"\"M\" is a linear map\nwhere F is the underlying field of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of real numbers. The elements of \"T\"\"M\" are called cotangent vectors.\n\nIn some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on \"M\". Informally, we will say that two smooth functions \"f\" and \"g\" are equivalent at a point \"x\" if they have the same first-order behavior near \"x\", analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions \"f\" and \"g\" have the same first order behaviour near \"x\" if and only if the derivative of the function \"f\"-\"g\" vanishes at \"x\". The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near \"x\".\n\nLet \"M\" be a smooth manifold and let \"x\" be a point in \"M\". Let \"I\" be the ideal of all functions in C(\"M\") vanishing at \"x\", and let \"I\" be the set of functions of the form formula_1, where \"f\", \"g\" ∈ \"I\". Then \"I\" and \"I\" are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the quotient space \"T\"\"M\" = \"I\" / \"I\".\n\nThis formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the Zariski tangent space in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to locally ringed spaces.\n\nLet \"M\" be a smooth manifold and let \"f\" ∈ C(\"M\") be a smooth function. The differential of \"f\" at a point \"x\" is the map\nwhere \"X\" is a tangent vector at \"x\", thought of as a derivation. That is formula_2 is the Lie derivative of \"f\" in the direction \"X\", and one has d\"f\"(\"X\")=\"X\"(\"f\"). Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write\nIn either case, d\"f\" is a linear map on \"T\"\"M\" and hence it is a tangent covector at \"x\".\n\nWe can then define the differential map d : C(\"M\") → \"T\"\"M\" at a point \"x\" as the map which sends \"f\" to d\"f\". Properties of the differential map include:\n\n\nThe differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function \"f\" ∈ \"I\" (a smooth function vanishing at \"x\") we can form the linear functional d\"f\" as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on \"I\" (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from \"I\" / \"I\" to the dual of the tangent space, (\"T\"\"M\"). One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.\n\nJust as every differentiable map \"f\" : \"M\" → \"N\" between manifolds induces a linear map (called the \"pushforward\" or \"derivative\") between the tangent spaces\nevery such map induces a linear map (called the \"pullback\") between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:\nThe pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the pushforward. Unraveling the definition, this means the following:\nwhere θ ∈ \"T\"\"N\" and \"X\" ∈ \"T\"\"M\". Note carefully where everything lives.\n\nIf we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let \"g\" be a smooth function on \"N\" vanishing at \"f\"(\"x\"). Then the pullback of the covector determined by \"g\" (denoted d\"g\") is given by\nThat is, it is the equivalence class of functions on \"M\" vanishing at \"x\" determined by \"g\" o \"f\".\n\nThe \"k\"-th exterior power of the cotangent space, denoted Λ(\"T\"\"M\"), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the \"k\"th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the \"k\"-th exterior power of the cotangent bundle, are called differential \"k\"-forms. They can be thought of as alternating, multilinear maps on \"k\" tangent vectors. \nFor this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called \"one-forms\".\n\n"}
{"id": "72208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72208", "title": "Counterfactual history", "text": "Counterfactual history\n\nCounterfactual history, also sometimes referred to as virtual history, is a form of historiography that attempts to answer \"what if\" questions known as counterfactuals. Black and MacRaild provide this definition: \"It is, at the very root, the idea of conjecturing on what did not happen, or what might have happened, in order to understand what did happen.\" The method seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had an outcome which was different from that which did in fact occur. It has produced a literary genre which is variously called alternative history, speculative history, or hypothetical history.\n\nOne goal is to estimate the relative importance of a specific event, incident or person. For instance, to the counterfactual claim \"What would have happened had Hitler drunk coffee instead of tea on the afternoon he committed suicide?\", the timeline would have remained unchanged—Hitler in all likelihood still would have committed suicide on April 30, 1945, regardless of what he had to drink that afternoon. However, to the counterfactual \"What would have happened had Hitler died in the July 1944 assassination attempt?\", all sorts of possibilities become readily apparent, starting with the assumption that the German generals, had they been able to consolidate power over remaining Nazi functionaries such as Goebbels and Himmler, would probably have sued for peace, bringing an early end to World War II. (Historians generally feel popular support for the Party was still very strong in July 1944, and the party apparatus of Himmler, Goebbels, Speer, Bormann, Göring etc. would survive even an assassination of Hitler.) Thus, the counterfactual brings into sharp relief the question of how important Hitler was as an individual and how his personal fate shaped the course of the war and, ultimately, of world history.\n\nAlthough there are Victorian examples of counterfactual history, it was not until the very late 20th century that the exploration of counterfactuals in history was to begin in earnest.\n\nAn early example is \"If It Had Happened Otherwise\" (1931) which features a contribution by Winston Churchill who examined what would have happened had Robert E. Lee won at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although this volume is notable for featuring imagined histories by serious historians, the histories are presented in narrative form (in most cases with a fairly whimsical tone) without any analysis of the reasoning behind these scenarios, so they fall short of modern standards for serious counterfactual history and are closer to the fictional alternate history genre.\n\nA significant foray into treating counterfactual scenarios seriously was made by the economic historian Robert Fogel. In his 1964 book \"\", Fogel tried to use quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 had there been no railroads. Fogel hypothesizes that, in the absence of the railroad, America’s large canal system would have been expanded and its roads would have been improved through pavement; both of these improvements would take away from the social impact of the railroad. He estimates that “the level of per capita income achieved by January 1, 1890 would have been reached by March 31, 1890, if railroads had never been invented.”\n\nFew further attempts to bring counterfactual history into the world of academia were made until the 1991 publication of \"Plausible Worlds: Possibility and Understanding in History and the Social Sciences\" by the Cambridge sociologist Geoffrey Hawthorn, who carefully explored three different counterfactual scenarios. This work helped inspire \"\" (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as Marxism, and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of \"What If?\" books edited by Robert Cowley presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about \"how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time.\"\n\nSome scholars argue that a counterfactual is not as much a matter of what happened in the past but it is the disagreement about which past events were most significant. For example, William Thompson employs a sequence of counterfactuals for eight lead economies that have driven globalization processes for almost a thousand years. From Song dynasty in China to Genoa, Venice, Portugal, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, and claims that each actor in succession played an unusually critical role in creating a structure of leadership that became increasingly global in scope across time.\n\nCounterfactual history is neither historical revisionism nor alternate history.\n\nCounterfactual history distinguishes itself through its interest in the very incident that is being negated by the counterfactual, thus seeking to evaluate the event's relative historical importance. Such historians reason arguments for each change, outlining changes in broad terms only, as befits a mere byproduct of the exercise.\n\nAn alternate history writer, on the other hand, is interested precisely in the hypothetical scenarios that flow from the negated incident or event. A fiction writer is thus free to invent very specific events and characters in the imagined history.\n\nThe line is sometimes blurred as historians may invent more detailed timelines as illustrations of their ideas about the types of changes that might have occurred. But it is usually clear what general types of consequences the author thinks are reasonable to suppose would have been likely to occur, and what specific details are included in an imagined timeline only for illustrative purposes.\n\nThe line is further blurred by novelists such as Kim Stanley Robinson, whose alternate-history novel \"The Years of Rice and Salt\" has a character talking of historians' use of counterfactuals, within the novel's alternate history. He dismisses this as \"a useless exercise\".\n\nMost historians regard counterfactual history as perhaps entertaining, but not meeting the standards of mainstream historical research due to its speculative nature. Advocates of counterfactual history often respond that all statements about causality in history contain implicit counterfactual claims—for example, the claim that a certain military decision helped a country win a war presumes that if that decision had not been made, the war would have been less likely to be won, or would have been longer.\n\nSince counterfactual history is such a recent development, a serious, systematic critique of its uses and methodologies has yet to be made, as the movement itself is still working out those methods and frameworks.\n\nAviezer Tucker has offered a range of criticism of this approach to the study of the past both in his review of Ferguson's \"Virtual History in History and Theory\" and in his book \"Our Knowledge of the Past: A Philosophy of Historiography\", as has Richard J. Evans in his book \"Altered Pasts\".\n\n\n"}

One such reflection is \"Dharma bhāvanā\"-\n\nIn Jainism, the \"dharma\" (conduct or path) of the householder (Śrāvaka) is distinguished from the conduct of an ascetic. Sravaka-dharma is the religious path for the virtuous householders, where charity and worship are the primary duties. The dharma of a householders consists of observance of twelve vows i.e. five minor vows and seven disciplinary vows.\nSramana-dharma is the religious path of the virtuous ascetics, where mediatation and study of scriptures is their primary duty. The religion of monks consists of five \"Mahavratas\" or great vows. They are endowed with right faith, right knowledge and right conduct and engaged in complete self-restraint and penances.\n\nAccording to Jainism, Universe and its constituents are uncreated and everlasting. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is \"vatthu sahāvo dhammo\" translated as \"the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma.\"\n\nDharma is one of the six substances constituting the universe. These substances are – Dharma (medium of motion), Adharma (medium of rest), Akasa (space), kala (time), Pudgala (matter) and Jiva (soul). Since Dharma as a substance extends and pervades entire universe, it is also known as Dharmastikaya. It helps the matter and souls in movement. It itself is not motion, but is a medium of motion. Adharma is opposite of Dharma i.e. it assists the substances like soul and matter to rest.\n\nAccording to Jainism, \"Samyak darsana\" (Rational Perception), \"Samyak jnana\" (Rational Knowledge) and \"Samyak caritra\" (Rational Conduct) collectively also known as \"Ratnatraya\" or the \"Three Jewels of Jainism\" constitute the path to liberation.\n\nSamyak Darsana or rational perception is the rational faith in the true nature of every substances of the universe. Samyak Jnana or rational knowledge is the right knowledge of true and relevant knowledge of the reality, the tattvas. It incorporates the two principles of Anekantvada or non-absolutism and Syadvada or relativity of truth. Right knowledge must be free from three main defects: doubt, delusion, and indefiniteness. Samyak Caritra or rational conduct is the natural conduct of a (soul) living being. It consists in following austerities, engaging in right activities and observance of vows, carefulness and controls.\n\nAccording to the Jain text, Tattvarthsutra, following are the ten virtues (\"das-dharma\").-\n\n"}

Numerous rival plans (the Townsend Plan, the McClain Movement, the Ham and Eggs Movement) were made to address the issue. Eventually, as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Social Security Act was passed to meet the need.\n\nAs the population aged and the aged grew wealthier throughout the second half of the twentieth century, their political influence increased.

{"id": "18613279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18613279", "title": "Employee monitoring", "text": "Employee monitoring\n\nEmployee Monitoring is the act of employers surveying employee activity through different surveillance methods. Organizations engage in employee monitoring for different reasons such as to track performance, to avoid legal liability, to protect trade secrets, and to address other security concerns. This practice may impact employee satisfaction due to its impact on the privacy of the employees. Among organizations, the extent and methods of employee monitoring differ.[1]\n\nDue to the use of company computers, telephones, workspaces, and software, employers can have access to the daily activities of their employees. These devices are used to monitor the organizations' employees. Common methods of monitoring include software monitoring, telephone tapping, video surveillance, email monitoring, and location monitoring.\n\nSoftware monitoring can occur if employees use company computers for their work, companies often utilize employee monitoring software that allows them to track what their employees are doing on the computers. Such as, what the speed of typing is, what mistakes are made, what applications were used, and what specific keys were pressed.\n\nTelephone tapping can be used to recover employees' phone call details and conversations. These can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.\n\nVideo surveillance can provide video feed of employee activities that are passed through to a central location where they are monitored live by another person. These can be recorded and stored for future reference which some believe is the most accurate way to monitor employees. \"This is a benefit because it provides an unbiased method of performance evaluation and prevents the interference of a manager's feelings in an employee's review (Mishra and Crampton, 1998).\" Management can review the performance of an employee by checking the surveillance to detect and potentially prevent problems.[1]\n\nEmail monitoring gives employers the ability to look at email messages sent or received by their employees. Emails can be viewed and recovered even if they had been previously deleted. In the United States, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act provides some privacy protections regarding monitoring of employees' email messages and other electronic communications. See Electronic Communications Privacy Act § Employee Privacy.\n\nLocation monitoring can occur and be used for employees that do not work in a static location. Supervisors may choose to track their location. Common examples of companies that use location monitoring are delivery and transportation industries. In some of these cases, the employee monitoring is incidental as the location is tracked for other purposes, that can help improve customer satisfaction. Employees' phone call details and conversations can be recorded during monitoring. The number of calls, the duration of each call, and the idle time between calls, can all go into an automatic log for analysis by the company.\n\nKey logging, or keystroke logging, is a process that records the keys a user is typing on the keyboard in order. These programs can also capture screenshots when triggered by predefined keywords. Some see it as violating workplace privacy and it's also notorious for being used with malicious intent. Loggers collect and store passwords, bank account information, private messages, credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and usernames. \nEmployee monitoring often is in conflict with employees' privacy. Monitoring often collects work-related activities, but it can also collect employee's personal information that is not linked to their work. Monitoring in the workplace may put employers and employees at odds because both sides are trying to protect personal interests. Employees want to maintain their privacy while employers want to ensure company resources aren't misused. In any case, companies can maintain ethical monitoring policies by avoiding indiscriminate monitoring of employees' activities. The employee needs to understand what is expected of them while the employer needs to establish that rule.\n\nWith employee monitoring, there are many guidelines that one must follow and put in place to protect the company and the individual. Some following cases are ones that have shaped the certain rules and regulations that are in effect today. For instance, in Canada, it is illegal to perform invasive monitoring, such as reading an employee's emails, unless it can be shown that it is a necessary precaution and there are no other alternatives. In Maryland, everyone in the conversation must give consent before the conversation can be recorded. The state of California requires that the monitored conversations have a beep at certain intervals or there must be a message informing the caller that the conversations may be recorded. However, this does not inform the company representative which calls are being recorded. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Colorado and New Jersey have laws relating to when a conversation can be recorded. \"Lawyers generally advise that one way for businesses to avoid liability for monitoring employees’ online activities is to take all necessary steps to eliminate any reasonable expectation of privacy that employees may have concerning their use of company email and other communications systems.\" Businesses makes employee monitoring a known tool that supervisors use to avoid any potential legal issues that may arise. They will announce this during new hire orientation, in a staff meeting, or even in a workplace contract that employees sign either at the time of hire or after a form of misconduct.\n\nBusinesses use employee monitoring for various reasons. The follow is a list that includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\nAccording to Computer Monitoring: The Hidden War Of Control,\"The employer of today has the ability and legal right to read e-mail, review files stored on a company computer, examine computer usage, and track individual employee computer activities. The idea of anonymous actions is an illusion. Every action between a network and the computers connected to it can be tracked. Every action by an individual worker on a computer can be tracked, analyzed and used against the employee. The protections and freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are there to protect the individual from the Government and do not generally apply to the normal employee/employer relationship.\" To benefit the business, employers have the ability to monitor employees whenever they feel is necessary.\n\nIn January 2016, European Court of Human Rights issued a landmark ruling in the case of Bărbulescu v Romania (61496/08) regarding monitoring of employees’ computers. The employee Mr. Bărbulescu accused the employer of violating his rights to ‘private life’ and ‘correspondence’ set in the Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBut the Court stated that the employer had every right to monitor the employee’s computer in this case due to the fact that such monitoring was implemented to ensure that there is no breach of company policy. This historic ruling has confirmed that it is not unreasonable for employers to monitor their employees’ computer activity and such monitoring does not violate their human rights.\n\nA year later, in July 2017, German court also ruled that computer monitoring of employees is reasonable but the use of keylogging software is excessive.\n\nEmployee monitoring software developers warn that in each case it is still recommended to advise a legal representative and the employees should give a written agreement with such monitoring Majority of instances are a case by case situation and is hard to treat all the issues and problems as one. With the ever growing laws, employers shape their guidelines around the new rules and regulations that are formed in court cases.\n\nEmployee Monitoring can be used to monitor the safety and productivity of the employees but it also may help businesses financially. From the dishonest unethical employee who steals time and money from the business to the redefining of unprofitable processes in monitoring employee actions, employee monitoring allows for the growth of financial profits from a small investment. The monitoring of employees can help in the protection of employees and it can help as protection in litigation by employees for job-related issues such as failing to perform, illegal activities and harassment claims. According to the American Management Association, almost half (48%) of the companies surveyed use video monitoring to counter theft, violence, and sabotage. Only 7% use video surveillance to track employees' on-the-job performance. Most employers notify employees of anti-theft video surveillance (78%) and performance-related video monitoring (89%), (Retrieved from the article The Latest on Workplace Monitoring and Surveillance on humanresources.about.com) In an article in \"Labour Economics\", it has been argued that forbidding employers to track employees' on-the-job performance can make economic sense according to efficiency wage theory, while surveillance to prevent illegal activities should be allowed.\n\nAn indirect way that companies can be affected financially through employee monitoring is that they can be sure they are billing clients correctly. According to \"Business 2 Community\", inaccurately billing clients is very possible because of the human error. These inaccuracies can cause a dispute between a company and a client which could eventually lead to the client terminating its business with the company. This sort of termination will not only hurt the company's revenue stream but also its reputation with other clients or potential clients. The suggested solution to this problem is a time tracking software to correctly monitor the number of hours a client spends with an employee. \n\nJohnathan Yerby said, \"The enormity of potential productivity loses, as reported by Court (2004), is approximately one million dollars\nannually for a company with 500 employees surfing the Internet for just a half hour a day.\" Not only does employee monitoring prevent theft of money and resources, but it also prevents theft of time and to make sure people are doing what they are supposed to be doing in the workplace. This is used a lot during the Holidays with online shopping, as well as during March Madness. Employees will spend their time using their work time for personal uses and employee monitoring helps regulate this.\n\n"}
{"id": "40435056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40435056", "title": "Equation-free modeling", "text": "Equation-free modeling\n\nEquation-free modeling is a method for multiscale computation and computer-aided analysis. It is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed, microscopic, level of description. The framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over large space-time scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales. The methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form; hence the term equation-free.\n\nIn a wide range of chemical, physical and biological systems, coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves (molecules, cells, grains, animals in a population, agents) and with their environment. Sometimes, remarkably, a coarse-scale differential equation model (such as the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow, or a reaction-diffusion system) can accurately describe macroscopic behavior. Such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation (atoms, particles, mass, momentum, energy), and closed into a well-posed system through phenomenological constitutive equations or equations of state. However, one increasingly encounters complex systems that only have known microscopic, fine scale, models. In such cases, although we observe the emergence of coarse-scale, macroscopic behavior, modeling it through explicit closure relations may be impossible or impractical. Non-Newtonian fluid flow, chemotaxis, porous media transport, epidemiology, brain modeling and neuronal systems are some typical examples. Equation-free modeling aims to use such microscale models to predict coarse macroscale emergent phenomena.\n\nPerforming coarse-scale computational tasks directly with fine-scale models is often infeasible: direct simulation over the full space-time domain of interest is often computationally prohibitive. Moreover, modeling tasks, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, are often impossible to perform on the fine-scale model directly: a coarse-scale steady state may not imply a steady state for the fine-scale system, since individual molecules or particles do not stop moving when the gas density or pressure become stationary. Equation-free modeling circumvents such problems by using short bursts of appropriately initialized fine-scale simulation.\n\nDynamic problems invoke the coarse time-stepper. In essence, short bursts of computational experiments with the fine-scale simulator estimate local time derivatives. Given an initial condition for the coarse variables formula_1 at time formula_2, the coarse time-stepper involves four steps:\n\n\nMultiple time steps simulates the system into the macro-future.\nIf the microscale model is stochastic, then an ensemble of microscale simulations may be needed to obtain sufficiently good extrapolation in the time step. Such a coarse time-stepper may be used in many algorithms of traditional continuum numerical analysis, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, optimization, control, and even accelerated coarse-scale simulation.\n\nTraditionally, algebraic formulae determine time derivatives of the coarse model. In our approach, the macroscale derivative is estimated by the inner microscale simulator, in effect performing a closure on demand. A reason for the name \"equation-free\" is by analogy with matrix-free numerical linear algebra; the name emphasizes that macro-level equations are never constructed explicitly in closed form.\n\nThe restriction operator often follows directly from the specific choice of the macroscale variables. For example, when the microscale model evolves an ensemble of many particles, the restriction typically computes the first few moments of the particle distribution (the density, momentum, and energy).\n\nThe lifting operator is usually much more involved. For example, consider a particle model: we need to define a mapping from a few low order moments of the particle distribution to initial conditions for each particle. The assumption that a relation exists that closes in these low order, coarse, moments, implies that the detailed microscale configurations are functionals of the moments (sometimes referred to as slaving ). We assume this relationship is established/emerges on time scales that are fast compared to the overall system evolution (see slow manifold theory and applications ). Unfortunately, the closure (slaving relations) are algebraically unknown (as otherwise the coarse evolution law would be known).\n\nInitializing the unknown microscale modes randomly introduces a lifting error: we rely on the separation of macro and micro time scales to ensure a quick relaxation to functionals of the coarse macrostates (healing). A preparatory step may be required, possibly involving microscale simulations constrained to keep the macrostates fixed. When the system has a unique fixed point for the unknown microscale details conditioned upon the coarse macrostates, a constrained runs algorithm may perform this preparatory step using only the microscale time-stepper.\n\nA toy problem illustrates the basic concepts. For example, consider the differential equation system for two variables formula_12:\nCapital formula_9 denotes the presumed macroscale variable, and lowercase formula_15 the microscale variable. This classification means that we assume a coarse model of the form formula_16 exists, although we do not necessarily know what it is. Arbitrarily define the lifting from any given macrostate formula_9 as formula_18. A simulation using this lifting and the coarse time-stepper is shown in the figure.\nThe solution of the differential equation rapidly moves to the slow manifold formula_19 for any initial data. The coarse time-stepper solution would agree better with the full solution when the 100 factor is increased. The graph shows the lifted solution (blue solid line) formula_20. At times formula_21, the solution is restricted and then lifted again, which here is simply setting formula_22. The slow manifold is shown as a red line. The right plot shows the time derivative of the restricted solution as a function of time (blue curve), as well as the time derivative formula_23 (the coarse time derivative), as observed from a full simulation (red curve).\n\nThe equation-free approach has been applied to many examples. The examples illustrate the various ways to construct and assemble the algorithmic building blocks. Numerical analysis establishes the accuracy and efficiency of this approach. Additional numerical analysis on other methods of this type has also been done.\n\nApplying the equation-free paradigm to a real problem requires considerable care, especially defining the lifting and restriction operators, and the appropriate outer solver.\n\n\nThe recursive projection method enables the computation of bifurcation diagrams using legacy simulation code. It also empowers the coarse time-stepper to perform equation-free bifurcation computations. Consider the coarse time stepper in its effective form\nwhich includes explicit dependence upon one or more parameters formula_25. Bifurcation analysis computes equilibria or periodic orbits, their stability and dependence upon parameter formula_25.\n\nCompute a coarse equilibrium as a fixed point of the coarse time stepper\nIn the equation-free context, the recursive projection method is the outer solver of this equation, and the coarse time-stepper enables this method to be performed using fine scale dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, for problems where the macroscale has continuous symmetries, one can use a template based approach to compute coarse self-similar or travelling wave solutions as fixed points of a coarse time-stepper that also encodes appropriate rescaling and/or shifting of space-time and/or solution.\nFor example, self-similar diffusion solutions may be found as the probability density function of detailed molecular dynamics.\n\nAn alternative to the recursive projection method is to use Newton—Krylov methods.\n\nThe coarse time stepper accelerates simulation over large macroscale times. In the scheme described above, let the large macro-time-step formula_28, and be on the time scale of the slow coarse dynamics. Let the computed formula_29 in terms of the coarse variable, and let the microscale simulation compute formula_30 from a local time simulation with initial condition that the coarse variable formula_31. Then we approximate formula_32 via extrapolating over a gap by\nwhere, for example, simple linear extrapolation would be \nThis scheme is the called coarse projective forward Euler, and is the simplest in the class.\n\nThe formula_35 steps taken before the extrapolation reflect that we must allow the system to settle onto a quasi-equilibrium (from the microscale point of view), so that we can make a reliable extrapolation of the slow dynamics. Then the size of the projective integration step is limited by stability of the slow modes.\n\nHigher order versions of coarse projective integration can be formed, analogous to Adams–Bashforth or Runge–Kutta. Higher order schemes for systems where the microscale noise is still apparent on the macroscale time step are more problematic.\n\nThe spatial analogue of projective integration is the gap-tooth scheme.\nThe idea of the gap-tooth scheme is to perform simulations of small patches of space, the teeth, separated by unsimulated space, the gaps.\nBy appropriately coupling the small patches of simulations we create a large scale, coarse level, simulation of the spatially extended system.\nWhen the microscale simulator is computationally expensive the gap-tooth scheme empowers efficient large scale prediction.\nFurthermore, it does this without us ever having to identify an algebraic closure for a large scale model.\nThe combination of the gap-tooth scheme with coarse projective integration is called patch dynamics.\n\nThe key to the gap-tooth and patch scheme is the coupling of the small patches across unsimulated space.\nSurprisingly, the generic answer is to simply use classic Lagrange interpolation, whether in one dimension or multiple dimensions. This answer is related to the coupling in holistic discretization and theoretical support provided by the theory of slow manifolds.\nThe interpolation provides value or flux boundary conditions as required by the microscale simulator. \nHigh order consistency between the macroscale gap-tooth/patch scheme and the microscale simulation is achieved through high order Lagrange interpolation.\n\nHowever, commonly the microscale is a noisy particle based or agent-based model.\nIn such cases the relevant macroscale variables are averages such as mass and momentum density. \nThen one generally has to form averages over a core of each tooth/patch, and apply the coupling condition over a finite action region on the edges of each tooth/patch.\nThe provisional recommendation is to make these regions as big as half the tooth/patch.\nThat is, for efficiency one makes the microscale tooth/patch as small as possible, but limited by the need to fit in action and core regions big enough to form accurate enough averages.\n\nPatch dynamics is the combination of the gap-tooth scheme and coarse projective integration. Just as for normal projective integration, at the start of each burst of microscale simulation, one has to create an initial condition for each patch that is consistent with the local macroscale variables, and the macroscale gradients from neighboring interpolated patches. The same techniques suffice.\n\nAssumptions and choices about the macroscale evolution are crucial in the equation-free scheme. The key assumption is that the variables we choose for the macroscale coupling must effectively close on the chosen macroscale. If the chosen macroscale length is too small then more coarse scale variables may be needed: for example, in fluid dynamics we conventionally close the PDEs for density, momentum and energy; yet in high speed flow especially at lower densities we need to resolve modes of molecular vibration because they have not equilibrated on the time scales of the fluid flow. Qualitatively the same considerations apply to the equation-free approach.\n\nFor many systems appropriate coarse variables are more-or-less known by experience. However, in complex situations there is a need to automatically detect the appropriate coarse variables, and then use them in the macroscale evolution. This needs much more research utilizing techniques from data mining and manifold learning. In some problems it could be that as well as densities, the appropriate coarse variables also need to include spatial correlations, as in the so-called Brownian bugs.\n\nThe macroscale may have to be treated as a stochastic system, but then the errors are likely to be much larger and the closures more uncertain.\n"}

{"id": "1920997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1920997", "title": "Harrod–Domar model", "text": "Harrod–Domar model\n\nThe Harrod–Domar model is a classical Keynesian model of economic growth. It is used in development economics to explain an economy's growth rate in terms of the level of saving and productivity of capital. It suggests that there is no natural reason for an economy to have balanced growth. The model was developed independently by Roy F. Harrod in 1939, and Evsey Domar in 1946, although a similar model had been proposed by Gustav Cassel in 1924. The Harrod–Domar model was the precursor to the exogenous growth model.\n\nNeoclassical economists claimed shortcomings in the Harrod–Domar model—in particular the instability of its solution—and, by the late 1950s, started an academic dialogue that led to the development of the Solow–Swan model.\n\nAccording to the Harrod–Domar model there are three kinds of growth: warranted growth, actual growth and natural rate of growth.\n\nWarranted growth rate is the rate of growth at which the economy does not expand indefinitely or go into recession. Actual growth is the real rate increase in a country's GDP per year. (See also: Gross domestic product and Natural gross domestic product). Natural growth is the growth an economy requires to maintain full employment. For example, If the labor force grows at 3 percent per year, then to maintain full employment, the economy’s annual growth rate must be 3 percent.\n\nLet \"Y\" represent output, which equals income, and let \"K\" equal the capital stock. \"S\" is total saving, \"s\" is the savings rate, and \"I\" is investment. \"δ\" stands for the rate of depreciation of the capital stock. The Harrod–Domar model makes the following \"a priori\" assumptions:\nDerivation of output growth rate:\n\nA derivation with calculus is as follows, using dot notation (for example, formula_2) for the derivative of a variable with respect to time.\n\nFirst, assumptions (1)–(3) imply that output and capital are linearly related (for readers with an economics background, this proportionality implies a capital-elasticity of output equal to unity). These assumptions thus generate equal growth rates between the two variables. That is,\n\nSince the marginal product of capital, \"c\", is a constant, we have\n\nNext, with assumptions (4) and (5), we can find capital's growth rate as,\n\nIn summation, the savings rate times the marginal product of capital minus the depreciation rate equals the output growth rate. Increasing the savings rate, increasing the marginal product of capital, or decreasing the depreciation rate will increase the growth rate of output; these are the means to achieve growth in the Harrod–Domar model.\n\nAlthough the Harrod–Domar model was initially created to help analyse the business cycle, it was later adapted to explain economic growth. Its implications were that growth depends on the quantity of labour and capital; more investment leads to capital accumulation, which generates economic growth. The model carries implications for less economically developed countries, where labour is in plentiful supply in these countries but physical capital is not, slowing down economic progress. LDCs do not have sufficiently high incomes to enable sufficient rates of saving; therefore, accumulation of physical-capital stock through investment is low.\n\nThe model implies that economic growth depends on policies to increase investment, by increasing saving, and using that investment more efficiently through technological advances.\n\nThe model concludes that an economy does not \"naturally\" find full employment and stable growth rates.\n\nThe main criticism of the model is the level of assumption, one being that there is no reason for growth to be sufficient to maintain full employment; this is based on the belief that the relative price of labour and capital is fixed, and that they are used in equal proportions. The model explains economic boom and bust by the assumption that investors are only influenced by output (known as the accelerator principle); this is now believed to be correct.\n\nIn terms of development, critics claim that the model sees economic growth and development as the same; in reality, economic growth is only a subset of development. Another criticism is that the model implies poor countries should borrow to finance investment in capital to trigger economic growth; however, history has shown that this often causes repayment problems later.\n\nThe endogeneity of savings:\nPerhaps the most important parameter in the Harrod–Domar model is the rate of savings. Can it be treated as a parameter that can be manipulated easily by policy? That depends on how much control the policy maker has over the economy. In fact, there are several reasons to believe that the rate of savings may itself be influenced by the overall level of per capita income in the society, not to mention the distribution of that income among the population.\n\n\n"}

However, his most notable contribution is the notion of \"Umwelt\", used by semiotician Thomas Sebeok and philosopher Martin Heidegger. His works established biosemiotics as a field of research.\n\nThe son of Alexander Baron von Uexküll and Sophie von Hahn, Jakob von Uexküll was born in the Keblas estate, Mihkli, Governorate of Estonia. His aristocratic family lost most of their fortune by expropriation during the Russian Revolution. Needing to support himself, Uexküll took a job as professor at the University of Hamburg where he founded the \"Institut für Umweltforschung\".\n\nUexküll was particularly interested in how living beings perceive their environment(s). He argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, 'self-in-world' subjective reference frames that he called \"Umwelt\" (translated as \"surrounding-world\", \"phenomenal world\", \"self-world\", \"environment\" - lit. German \"environment\"). These \"Umwelten\" (plural of \"Umwelt\") are distinctive from what Uexküll termed the \"Umgebung\" which would be the living being's surroundings as seen from the likewise peculiar perspective or \"Umwelt\" of the human observer. \"Umwelt\" may thus be defined as the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject. By studying how the senses of various organisms like ticks, sea urchins, amoebae, jellyfish and sea worms work, he was able to build theories of how they experience the world. Because all organisms perceive and react to sensory data as signs, Uexküll argued that they were to be considered as living subjects. This argument was the basis for his biological theory in which the characteristics of biological existence (\"life\") could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.\n\nThe biosemiotic turn in Jakob von Uexküll's analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal's relationship with its environment. The \"Umwelt\" is for him an environment-world which is (according to Giorgio Agamben), \"constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] \"carriers of significance\" or \"marks\" which are the only things that interest the animal\". Agamben goes on to paraphrase one example from Uexküll's discussion of a tick, saying,\n\"...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood.\"\nThus, for the tick, the \"Umwelt\" is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, (2) The temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (corresponding to the blood of all mammals), (3) The hairiness of mammals.\n\nvon Uexküll anticipated many computer science ideas, particularly in the field of robotics, roughly 25 years before these things were invented.\n\nUexküll views organisms in terms of information processing. He argues every organism has an outer boundary which defines an Umwelt (German word generally meaning 'environment', 'surrounding world'). Rather than the general meaning, Uexküll's concept draws on the literal meaning of the German word, which is 'surround-world', to define the Umwelt as the subjectively perceived surroundings about which information is available to an organism through its senses. This is a subjective \"weltanschauung\", or \"world view\", and is therefore fundamentally different from the black box concept, which is derived from the objective Newtonian viewpoint.\n\nThe organism has sensors that report the state of the \"Umwelt\" and effectors that can change parts of the \"Umwelt\". He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in a feedback loop. Sensor input is processed by a \"Merkorgan\" and effectors are controlled by a \"Werkorgan\". The modern term 'sensorimotor' used in enactive theories of cognition encompasses these concepts.\n\nHe further distinguishes the \"Umgebung\" (that part of the \"Umwelt\" that represents distal features of the external world, in German 'that which is being given as surroundings') from the Innenwelt which is reported directly by sensors and is therefore the only unmediated reality immediately knowable to the organism. The relationship between the distal (mediated, transformed) features of the Umbegung and the proximal (untransformed, unmediated, primal) features of the Innenwelt must be learned by the organism in infancy. The nature of the Umbegung::Innenwelt relationship is relevant to the later theories of Embodied cognition.\n\nThis is also similar to Kant's phenomenon and noumenon but derived logically from the properties of the sensors. What we now call a \"feedback loop\" he calls a \"function-circle\" and \"circle\" seems to be something like \"system\". He uses the term \"melody\" to mean something close to \"algorithm\". He coins around 75 technical terms, and a proper understanding of his book would require clearly defining them in modern terms and understanding their relations. He notices qualia, comes close to object-oriented programming (page 98) uses the image of a helmsman which later showed up as \"cybernetics\" (page 291) and makes a good guess about DNA (page 127). He has a large number of ideas, although not expressed clearly in modern terms. His metaphysics is hyper-Kantian (\"All reality is subjective appearance\", page xv.) Space is a set of direction symbols. He rejects Darwin and says nothing of God. Organisms are based on something called \"Plan\", the origin of which we cannot know.\n\nUexküll was an advocate of non-Darwinian evolution and critic of Darwinism. Kalevi Kull noted that \"despite his opposition to Darwinism, Uexküll was not anti-evolutionist\".\n\nWorks by scholars such as Kalevi Kull connect Uexküll's studies with some areas of philosophy such as phenomenology and hermeneutics. Jakob von Uexküll is also considered a pioneer of semiotic biology, or biosemiotics. However, despite his influence (on the work of philosophers Max Scheler, Ernst Cassirer, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Humberto Maturana, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (in their \"A Thousand Plateaus\"), for example) he is still not widely known, and his books are mostly out of print in German and in English. A paperback French translation of \"Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen\" [A stroll through the Umwelten of animals and humans] of 1934 is currently in print. This book has been translated in English as \"A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with A Theory of Meaning\" by Jakob von Uexküll, translated by Joseph D. O'Neil, introduction by Dorion Sagan, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. The other available book is \"Theoretical Biology\", a reprint of the 1926 translation of \"Theoretische Biologie\" (1920). \"Foray\" is a popular introduction while \"Theoretical Biology\" is intended for an academic audience.\n\nHis sons were the physician Thure von Uexküll and journalist Gösta von Uexküll. His daughter was Sophie Luise Damajanti von Uexküll ('Dana'). His grandson is the writer Jakob von Uexkull.\n\nUexküll's ideas about how organisms create their own concept of time are described in Peter Høeg's novel \"Borderliners\", and contrasted with Isaac Newton's view of time as something that exists independent of life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "341265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341265", "title": "Jungle", "text": "Jungle\n\nA jungle is land covered with dense vegetation dominated by trees. Application of the term has varied greatly over recent centuries and it has little scientific meaning. Before the 1970s, various tropical forests were referred to as jungles but this terminology has fallen out of usage. Jungles in Western literature can represent a less civilised or unruly space outside the control of civilisation, attributed to the jungle's association in colonial discourse with places colonised by Europeans.\n\nThe word \"jungle\" originates from the Sanskrit word \"Jangla\" (), meaning uncultivated land. Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense \"tangled thicket\" while others have argued that a cognate word in Urdu did refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.\n\nBecause jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different climatic zones, the wildlife of jungles can not be straightforwardly defined.\n\nOne of the most common meanings of \"jungle\" is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the tropics. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through. This definition draws a distinction between rainforest and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse. Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, rainforests in areas where rainforest has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging. The successional vegetation that springs up following such disturbance of rainforest is dense and impenetrable and is a ‘typical’ jungle. Jungle also typically forms along rainforest margins such as stream banks, once again due to the greater available light at ground level.\n\nMonsoon forests and mangroves are commonly referred to as jungles of this type. Having a more open canopy than rainforests, monsoon forests typically have dense understoreys with numerous lianas and shrubs making movement difficult, while the prop roots and low canopies of mangroves produce similar difficulties.\n\nBecause European explorers initially travelled through tropical rainforests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle. This in turn appears to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually any humid tropical forest. Jungle in this context is particularly associated with tropical rain forest, but may extend to cloud forest, temperate rainforest, and mangroves with no reference to the vegetation structure or the ease of travel.\n\nThe generic term \"tropical forest\" and \"rainforest\" have largely replaced \"jungle\" as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. \"Rainforest\" itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s. The word \"jungle\" accounted for over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by \"rainforest\", although \"jungle\" still remains in common use when referring to tropical rainforests.\n\nAs a metaphor, \"jungle\" often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be \"survival of the fittest\". This reflects the view of \"city people\" that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave the title \"The Jungle\" (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse.\n\nThe term \"The Law of the Jungle\" is also used in a similar context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" (1894)—though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.\n\nThe word \"jungle\" itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation. The change from \"jungle\" to \"rainforest\" as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of \"jungle\".\n\nCultural scholars, especially post-colonial critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: Edward Said notes that the Tarzan depicted by Johnny Weissmuller was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it; and in his essay \"An Image of Africa\" about \"Heart of Darkness\" Nigerian novelist and theorist Chinua Achebe notes how the jungle and Africa become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak compared Israel to \"a villa in the jungle\" - a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison. For example, Uri Avnery charged that comparing \"civilised\" Israel with \"a villa\" and Israel's Arab neighbors with the \"wild beasts\" of the \"jungle\" tends to throw the blame for the absence of peace on the \"wild\" Arab and Palestinian side, and absolve Israel of responsibility.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1902163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1902163", "title": "Lean software development", "text": "Lean software development\n\nLean software development is a translation of lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development domain. Adapted from the Toyota Production System, it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the Agile community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support agile organizations.\n\nThe term lean software development originated in a book by the same name, written by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck. The book restates traditional lean principles, as well as a set of 22 \"tools\" and compares the tools to corresponding agile practices. The Poppendiecks' involvement in the Agile software development community, including talks at several Agile conferences has resulted in such concepts being more widely accepted within the Agile community.\n\nLean development can be summarized by seven principles, very close in concept to lean manufacturing principles:\n\nLean philosophy regards everything not adding value to the customer as waste (\"muda\"). Such waste may include:\n\n\nIndustry research revealed these software development wastes:\n\nIn order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it. If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste. Partially done coding eventually abandoned during the development process is waste. Extra processes like paperwork and features not often used by customers are waste. Switching people between tasks is waste. Waiting for other activities, teams, processes is waste. Motion required to complete work is waste. Defects and lower quality are waste. Managerial overhead not producing real value is waste.\n\nA value stream mapping technique is used to identify waste. The second step is to point out sources of waste and to eliminate them. Waste-removal should take place iteratively until even seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.\n\nSoftware development is a continuous learning process based on iterations when writing code. Software design is a problem solving process involving the developers writing the code and what they have learned. Software value is measured in fitness for use and not in conformance to requirements.\n\nInstead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building. The process of user requirements gathering could be simplified by presenting screens to the end-users and getting their input. The accumulation of defects should be prevented by running tests as soon as the code is written.\n\nThe learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles – each one coupled with refactoring and integration testing. Increasing feedback via short feedback sessions with customers helps when determining the current phase of development and adjusting efforts for future improvements. During those short sessions both customer representatives and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solutions for further development. Thus the customers better understand their needs, based on the existing result of development efforts, and the developers learn how to better satisfy those needs. Another idea in the communication and learning process with a customer is set-based development – this concentrates on communicating the constraints of the future solution and not the possible solutions, thus promoting the birth of the solution via dialogue with the customer.\n\nAs software development is always associated with some uncertainty, better results should be achieved with a \"set-based\" or \"options-based\" approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions. The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it, thus enabling the delay of important and crucial commitments. The iterative approach promotes this principle – the ability to adapt to changes and correct mistakes, which might be very costly if discovered after the release of the system.\n\nAn agile software development approach can move the building of options earlier for customers, thus delaying certain crucial decisions until customers have realized their needs better. This also allows later adaptation to changes and the prevention of costly earlier technology-bounded decisions. This does not mean that no planning should be involved – on the contrary, planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation, as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action. Evaluating different options is effective as soon as it is realized that they are not free, but provide the needed flexibility for late decision making.\n\nIn the era of rapid technology evolution, it is not the biggest that survives, but the fastest. The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration. The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team. With speed, decisions can be delayed. Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday. This gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge. Customers value rapid delivery of a quality product.\n\nThe just-in-time production ideology could be applied to software development, recognizing its specific requirements and environment. This is achieved by presenting the needed result and letting the team organize itself and divide the tasks for accomplishing the needed result for a specific iteration. At the beginning, the customer provides the needed input. This could be simply presented in small cards or stories – the developers estimate the time needed for the implementation of each card. Thus the work organization changes into self-pulling system – each morning during a stand-up meeting, each member of the team reviews what has been done yesterday, what is to be done today and tomorrow, and prompts for any inputs needed from colleagues or the customer. This requires transparency of the process, which is also beneficial for team communication.\n\nThere has been a traditional belief in most businesses about the decision-making in the organization – the managers tell the workers how to do their own job. In a \"Work-Out technique\", the roles are turned – the managers are taught how to listen to the developers, so they can explain better what actions might be taken, as well as provide suggestions for improvements. The lean approach follows the Agile Principle \"find good people and let them do their own job,\" encouraging progress, catching errors, and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.\n\nAnother mistaken belief has been the consideration of people as resources. People might be resources from the point of view of a statistical data sheet, but in software development, as well as any organizational business, people do need something more than just the list of tasks and the assurance that they will not be disturbed during the completion of the tasks. People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for – purpose within the reachable reality, with the assurance that the team might choose its own commitments. The developers should be given access to the customer; the team leader should provide support and help in difficult situations, as well as ensure that scepticism does not ruin the team’s spirit.\n\nThe customer needs to have an overall experience of the System. This is the so-called perceived integrity: how it is being advertised, delivered, deployed, accessed, how intuitive its use is, its price and how well it solves problems.\n\nConceptual integrity means that the system’s separate components work well together as a whole with balance between flexibility, maintainability, efficiency, and responsiveness. This could be achieved by understanding the problem domain and solving it at the same time, not sequentially. The needed information is received in small batch pieces – not in one vast chunk - preferably by face-to-face communication and not any written documentation. The information flow should be constant in both directions – from customer to developers and back, thus avoiding the large stressful amount of information after long development in isolation.\n\nOne of the healthy ways towards integral architecture is refactoring. As more features are added to the original code base, the harder it becomes to add further improvements. Refactoring is about keeping simplicity, clarity, minimum number of features in the code. Repetitions in the code are signs of bad code designs and should be avoided. The complete and automated building process should be accompanied by a complete and automated suite of developer and customer tests, having the same versioning, synchronization and semantics as the current state of the System. At the end the integrity should be verified with thorough testing, thus ensuring the System does what the customer expects it to. Automated tests are also considered part of the production process, and therefore if they do not add value they should be considered waste. Automated testing should not be a goal, but rather a means to an end, specifically the reduction of defects.\n\nSoftware systems nowadays are not simply the sum of their parts, but also the product of their interactions. Defects in software tend to accumulate during the development process – by decomposing the big tasks into smaller tasks, and by standardizing different stages of development, the root causes of defects should be found and eliminated. The larger the system, the more organizations that are involved in its development and the more parts are developed by different teams, the greater the importance of having well defined relationships between different vendors, in order to produce a system with smoothly interacting components. During a longer period of development, a stronger subcontractor network is far more beneficial than short-term profit optimizing, which does not enable win-win relationships.\n\nLean thinking has to be understood well by all members of a project, before implementing in a concrete, real-life situation. \"Think big, act small, fail fast; learn rapidly\" – these slogans summarize the importance of understanding the field and the suitability of implementing lean principles along the whole software development process. Only when all of the lean principles are implemented together, combined with strong \"common sense\" with respect to the working environment, is there a basis for success in software development.\n\nLean software development practices, or what the Poppendiecks call \"tools\" are restated slightly from the original equivalents in Agile software development. Examples of such practices include:\n\n\nSince Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto, Lean Software Development is considered an Agile Software Development Method.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48934", "title": "Lobbying", "text": "Lobbying\n\nLobbying, persuasion, or interest representation is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in their daily life, most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies. Lobbying is done by many types of people, associations and organized groups, including individuals in the private sector, corporations, fellow legislators or government officials, or advocacy groups (interest groups). Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within their electoral district; they may engage in lobbying as a business. Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Individuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job. Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential.\n\nThe ethics and morals involved with lobbying are complicated. Lobbying can, at times, be spoken of with contempt, when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a duty to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the public good, can benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, a conflict of interest exists. Many critiques of lobbying point to the potential for conflicts of interest to lead to agent misdirection or the intentional failure of an agent with a duty to serve an employer, client, or constituent to perform those duties. The failure of government officials to serve the public interest as a consequence of lobbying by special interests who provide benefits to the official is an example of agent misdirection.\n\nIn a report carried by the BBC, an OED lexicographer has shown that \"lobbying\" finds its roots in the gathering of Members of Parliament and peers in the hallways (\"lobbies\") of the UK Houses of Parliament before and after parliamentary debates where members of the public can meet their representatives.\n\nOne story held that the term originated at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, where it was supposedly used by President Ulysses S. Grant to describe the political advocates who frequented the hotel's lobby to access Grant—who was often there in the evenings to enjoy a cigar and brandy—and would then try to buy the president drinks in an attempt to influence his political decisions. Although the term may have gained more widespread currency in Washington, D.C. by virtue of this practice during the Grant Administration, the OED cites numerous documented uses of the word well before Grant's presidency, including use in Pennsylvania as early as 1808.\n\nThe term \"lobbying\" also appeared in print as early as 1820:\n\nDictionary definitions:\n\nGovernments often define and regulate organized group lobbying as part of laws to prevent political corruption and by establishing transparency about possible influences by public lobby registers.\n\nLobby groups may concentrate their efforts on the legislatures, where laws are created, but may also use the judicial branch to advance their causes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for example, filed suits in state and federal courts in the 1950s to challenge segregation laws. Their efforts resulted in the Supreme Court declaring such laws unconstitutional.\n\nLobbyists may use a legal device known as \"amicus curiae\" (literally: \"friend of the court\") briefs to try to influence court cases. Briefs are written documents filed with a court, typically by parties to a lawsuit. \"Amici curiae\" briefs are briefs filed by people or groups who are not parties to a suit. These briefs are entered into the court records, and give additional background on the matter being decided upon. Advocacy groups use these briefs both to share their expertise and to promote their positions.\n\nThe lobbying industry is affected by the revolving door concept, a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and roles in the industries affected by legislation and regulation, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials. This climate is attractive for ex-government officials. It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for lobbying firms, and government projects and contracts worth in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.\n\nThe international standards for the regulation of lobbying were introduced at four international organizations and supranational associations: 1) the European Union; 2) the Council of Europe; 3) the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; 4) the Commonwealth of Independent States. \n\nIn pre-modern political systems, royal courts provided incidental opportunities for gaining the ear of monarchs and their councillors.\n\nKellogg School of Management found that political donations by corporations do not increase shareholder value.\n\nOver the past twenty years, lobbying in Australia has grown from a small industry of a few hundred employees to a multi-billion dollar per year industry. What was once the preserve of big multinational companies and at a more local level, property developers, for example Urban Taskforce Australia, has morphed into an industry that would employ more than 10,000 people and represent every facet of human endeavour.\n\nA register of federal lobbyists is kept by the Australian Government and is accessible to the public via its website. Similar registers for State government lobbyists were introduced between 2007 and 2009 around Australia. Since April 2007 in Western Australia, only lobbyists listed on the state's register are allowed to contact a government representative for the purpose of lobbying. Similar rules have applied in Tasmania since 1 September 2009 and in South Australia and Victoria since 1 December 2009.\n\nThe first step to towards specialized regulation of lobbying in the European Union was a Written Question tabled by Alman Metten, in 1989. In 1991, Marc Galle, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, was appointed to submit proposals for a Code of conduct and a register of lobbyists. Today lobbying in the European Union is an integral and important part of decision-making in the EU. From year to year lobbying regulation in the EU is constantly improving and the number of lobbyists are increases. According to Austrian Member of the European Parliament (\"MEP\") Hans-Peter Martin, the value of lobby invitations and offers each individual MEP receives can reach up to €10,000 per week.\n\nIn 2003 there were around 15,000 lobbyists (consultants, lawyers, associations, corporations, NGOs etc.) in Brussels seeking to influence the EU’s legislation. Some 2,600 special interest groups had a permanent office in Brussels. Their distribution was roughly as follows: European trade federations (32%), consultants (20%), companies (13%), NGOs (11%), national associations (10%), regional representations (6%), international organizations (5%) and think tanks (1%), (Lehmann, 2003, pp iii). In addition to this, lobby organisations sometimes hire former EU employees (a phenomenon known as the revolving door) who possess inside knowledge of the EU institutions and policy process A report by Transparency International EU published in January 2017 analysed the career paths of former EU officials and found that 30% of Members of the European Parliament who left politics went to work for organisations on the EU lobby register after their mandate and approximately one third of Commissioners serving under Barroso took jobs in the private sector after their mandate, including for Uber, ArcelorMittal, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. These potential conflicts of interest could be avoided if a stronger ethics framework would be established at the EU level, including an independent ethics body and longer cooling-off periods for MEPs.\n\nIn the wake of the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal in Washington D.C. and the massive impact this had on the lobbying scene in the United States, the rules for lobbying in the EU—which until now consist of only a non-binding code of conduct-—may also be tightened.\n\nThere is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the European Union where French lobbyists can register themselves. For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs.\n\nA 2016 study finds evidence of significant indirect lobbying of Berlusconi through business proxies. The authors document a significant pro-Mediaset (the mass media company founded and controlled by Berlusconi) bias in the allocation of advertising spending during Berlusconi's political tenure, in particular for companies operating in more regulated sectors.\n\nLobbying in the United States describes paid activity in which special interests hire professional advocates to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies such as the United States Congress. Lobbying in the United States could be seen to originate from Amendment I of the Constitution of the United States, which states: Congress shall make no law…abridging the right of the people peaceably…to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Some lobbyists are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.\n\nA number of published studies showed lobbying expenditure is correlated with great financial returns. For example, a 2011 study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the S&P 500 in the stock market concluded that spending on lobbying was a \"spectacular investment\" yielding \"blistering\" returns comparable to a high-flying hedge fund, even despite the financial downturn of the past few years. A 2011 meta-analysis of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance. Finally, a 2009 study found that lobbying brought a substantial return on investment, as much as 22,000% in some cases. Major American corporations spent $345 million lobbying for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.\n\nForeign-funded lobbying efforts include those of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, and China lobbies. In 2010 alone, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbying members of Congress and government officials.\n\nOther countries where lobbying is regulated in parliamentary bills include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "569840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569840", "title": "Mechanoreceptor", "text": "Mechanoreceptor\n\nA mechanoreceptor is a sensory receptor that responds to mechanical pressure or distortion. Normally there are four main types in glabrous, or hairless, mammalian skin: lamellar corpuscles, tactile corpuscles, Merkel nerve endings, and bulbous corpuscles. There are also mechanoreceptors in hairy skin, and the hair cells in thoreceptors of primates like rhesus monkeys and other mammals are similar to those of humans and also studied even in early 20th century anatomically and neurophysiologically.\n\nInvertebrate mechanoreceptors include campaniform sensilla and slit sensilla, among others.\n\nIn somatosensory transduction, the afferent neurons transmit messages through synapses in the dorsal column nuclei, where second-order neurons send the signal to the thalamus and synapse with third-order neurons in the ventrobasal complex. The third-order neurons then send the signal to the somatosensory cortex.\n\nMore recent work has expanded the role of the cutaneous mechanoreceptors for feedback in fine motor control. Single action potentials from Meissner's corpuscle, Pacinian corpuscle and Ruffini ending afferents are directly linked to muscle activation, whereas Merkel cell-neurite complex activation does not trigger muscle activity.\n\nIn glabrous (hairless) skin, there are four principal types of mechanoreceptors, each shaped according to its function. The tactile corpuscles (also known as Meissner corpuscles) respond to light touch, and adapt rapidly to changes in texture (vibrations around 50 Hz). The bulbous corpuscles (also known as Ruffini endings) detect tension deep in the skin and fascia. The Merkel nerve endings (also known as Merkel discs) detect sustained pressure. The lamellar corpuscles (also known as Pacinian corpuscles) in the skin and fascia detect rapid vibrations (of about 200–300 Hz).\n\nReceptors in hair follicles sense when a hair changes position. Indeed, the most sensitive mechanoreceptors in humans are the hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear (no relation to the follicular receptors – they are named for the hair-like mechanosensory stereocilia they possess); these receptors transduce sound for the brain.\n\nMechanosensory free nerve endings detect touch, pressure, and stretching.\n\nBaroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that is excited by stretch of the blood vessel.\n\nCutaneous mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stimuli that result from physical interaction, including pressure and vibration. They are located in the skin, like other cutaneous receptors. They are all innervated by Aβ fibers, except the mechanorecepting free nerve endings, which are innervated by Aδ fibers. Cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be categorized by morphology, by what kind of sensation they perceive, and by the rate of adaptation. Furthermore, each has a different receptive field.\n\n\nCutaneous mechanoreceptors can also be separated into categories based on their rates of adaptation. When a mechanoreceptor receives a stimulus, it begins to fire impulses or action potentials at an elevated frequency (the stronger the stimulus, the higher the frequency). The cell, however, will soon \"adapt\" to a constant or static stimulus, and the pulses will subside to a normal rate. Receptors that adapt quickly (i.e. quickly return to a normal pulse rate) are referred to as \"phasic\". Those receptors that are slow to return to their normal firing rate are called tonic. Phasic mechanoreceptors are useful in sensing such things as texture or vibrations, whereas tonic receptors are useful for temperature and proprioception among others.\n\n\nCutaneous mechanoreceptors with small, accurate receptive fields are found in areas needing accurate taction (e.g. the fingertips). In the fingertips and lips, innervation density of slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptors are greatly increased. These two types of mechanoreceptors have small discrete receptive fields and are thought to underlie most low-threshold use of the fingers in assessing texture, surface slip, and flutter. Mechanoreceptors found in areas of the body with less tactile acuity tend to have larger receptive fields.\n\nOther mechanoreceptors than cutaneous ones include the hair cells, which are sensory receptors in the vestibular system of the inner ear, where they contribute to the auditory system and equilibrioception. In addition to this, mechanoreceptors aid \"Dionaea muscipula Ellis\" (Venus Fly Trap) in capturing sizable prey effectively.\n\nThere are also Juxtacapillary (J) receptors, which respond to events such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, and barotrauma.\n\nThere are four types of mechanoreceptors embedded in ligaments. As all these types of mechanoreceptors are myelinated, they can rapidly transmit sensory information regarding joint positions to the central nervous system.\nType II and Type III mechanoreceptors in particular are believed to be linked to one's sense of proprioception\n\nLamellar corpuscles, or Pacinian corpuscles, are pressure receptors located in the skin and also in various internal organs. Each is connected to a sensory neuron. \nBecause of its relatively large size, a single lamellar corpuscle can be isolated and its properties studied. Mechanical pressure of varying strength and frequency can be applied to the corpuscle by stylus, and the resulting electrical activity detected by electrodes attached to the preparation.\n\nDeforming the corpuscle creates a generator potential in the sensory neuron arising within it. This is a graded response: the greater the deformation, the greater the generator potential. If the generator potential reaches threshold, a volley of action potentials (nerve impulses) are triggered at the first node of Ranvier of the sensory neuron.\n\nOnce threshold is reached, the magnitude of the stimulus is encoded in the frequency of impulses generated in the neuron. So the more massive or rapid the deformation of a single corpuscle, the higher the frequency of nerve impulses generated in its neuron.\n\nThe optimal sensitivity of a lamellar corpuscle is 250 Hz, the frequency range generated upon finger tips by textures made of features smaller than 200 micrometres.\n\nThe knee jerk is the popularly known stretch reflex (involuntary kick of the lower leg) induced by tapping the knee with a rubber-headed hammer. The hammer strikes a tendon that inserts an extensor muscle in the front of the thigh into the lower leg. Tapping the tendon stretches the thigh muscle, which activates stretch receptors within the muscle called muscle spindles. Each muscle spindle consists of sensory nerve endings wrapped around special muscle fibers called spindle fibers (also called intrafusal fibers). Stretching a spindle fiber initiates a volley of impulses in the sensory neuron (a I-a neuron) attached to it. The impulses travel along the sensory axon to the spinal cord where they form several kinds of synapses:\n\n\n"}

Although it can still be useful to generate scatter plots of the response variable against each of the independent variables, this does not take into account the effect of the other independent variables in the model.\n\nPartial regression plots are formed by:\nVelleman and Welsch\nexpress this mathematically as:\nwhere\n\nVelleman and Welsch list the following useful properties for this plot:\n\nPartial regression plots are related to, but distinct from, partial residual plots. Partial regression plots are most commonly used to identify data points with high leverage and influential data points that might not have high leverage. Partial residual plots are most commonly used to identify the nature of the relationship between \"Y\" and \"X\" (given the effect of the other independent variables in the model). Note that since the simple correlation between the two sets of residuals plotted is equal to the partial correlation between the response variable and \"X\", partial regression plots will show the correct strength of the linear relationship between the response variable and \"X\". This is not true for partial residual plots. On the other hand, for the partial regression plot, the x-axis is not \"X\". This limits its usefulness in determining the need for a transformation (which is the primary purpose of the partial residual plot).\n\n\n\n"}

This was believed in the Western world into the 20th century until cognitive psychology experiments decisively proved that it was not true, and that many events were simply filled in by the mind, based on what \"should be\". This, among other things, explained why eyewitness accounts of events often were so widely varied.\n\nIn Ancient Rome it was believed that personal experience was part of some divine or species-wide collective experience. This gave rise to notions of racial memory, national mission, and such notions as racism and patriotism. It was likely easier to create political movements and military morale with such notions, than a strictly personal idea of experience. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell were notable investigators of these ideas of collective experience in the 20th century.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, there was rigorous investigation of these ideas. Immanuel Kant noted that it was only possible to explain \"experience and its objects\" as a consequence of each other: either experience makes those objects possible, or those objects make experience possible. This is seen today as dualism, and denying the possibility of a third thing making both experience and whatever reality its objects have, both possible. That thing could be a more universal cognition, as proposed in some versions of Christianity or Gaia philosophy.\n\n"}

From a philosophical viewpoint, nominal value represents an accepted condition, which is a goal or an approximation, as opposed to the real value, which is always present. \n\nIn measurement, a nominal value is often a value existing in name only; it is assigned as a convenient designation rather than calculated by data analysis or following usual rounding methods. The use of nominal values can be based on de facto standards or some technical standards.\n\nAll real measurements have some variation depending on the accuracy and precision of the test method and the measurement uncertainty. The use of reported values often involves engineering tolerances.\n\nOne way to consider this is that the real value often has the characteristics of an irrational number. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long gauge block will measure to be exactly 1 inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1 inch is not the real value of the gauge block length, but some other number approximates it.\n\nIn various subfields of engineering, a nominal value is one for which the \"name\" for the value is close to, but not the same as, the actual value. Some examples:\n\n\nOther cases involve diameter, speed, and volume.\n\nSometimes the word \"nominal\" is misused in engineering contexts as a synonym for \"normal\" or \"expected\"; for example, \"The rotor resistances on all the other operating wheels are nominal.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "39781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39781", "title": "Simplex", "text": "Simplex\n\nIn geometry, a simplex (plural: simplexes or simplices) is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions.\nSpecifically, a \"k\"-simplex is a \"k\"-dimensional polytope which is the convex hull of its \"k\" + 1 vertices. \nMore formally, suppose the \"k\" + 1 points formula_1 are affinely independent, which means formula_2 are linearly independent.\nThen, the simplex determined by them is the set of points\n\nFor example, a 2-simplex is a triangle, a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron, and a 4-simplex is a 5-cell. A single point may be considered a 0-simplex, and a line segment may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest convex set containing the given vertices.\n\nA regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope. A regular \"n\"-simplex may be constructed from a regular (\"n\" − 1)-simplex by connecting a new vertex to all original vertices by the common edge length.\n\nThe standard simplex or probability simplex is the simplex formed from the \"k\" + 1 standard unit vectors, or \n\nIn topology and combinatorics, it is common to “glue together” simplices to form a simplicial complex. The associated combinatorial structure is called an abstract simplicial complex, in which context the word “simplex” simply means any finite set of vertices.\n\nThe concept of a simplex was known to William Kingdon Clifford, who wrote about these shapes in 1886 but called them \"prime confines\". \nHenri Poincaré, writing about algebraic topology in 1900, called them \"generalized tetrahedra\".\nIn 1902 Pieter Hendrik Schoute described the concept first with the Latin superlative \"simplicissimum\" (\"simplest\") and then with the same Latin adjective in the normal form \"simplex\" (\"simple\").\n\n\nThe convex hull of any nonempty subset of the \"n\" + 1 points that define an \"n\"-simplex is called a face of the simplex. Faces are simplices themselves. In particular, the convex hull of a subset of size \"m\" + 1 (of the \"n\" + 1 defining points) is an \"m\"-simplex, called an \"m\"-face of the \"n\"-simplex. The 0-faces (i.e., the defining points themselves as sets of size 1) are called the vertices (singular: vertex), the 1-faces are called the edges, the (\"n\" − 1)-faces are called the facets, and the sole \"n\"-face is the whole \"n\"-simplex itself. In general, the number of \"m\"-faces is equal to the binomial coefficient formula_5. Consequently, the number of \"m\"-faces of an \"n\"-simplex may be found in column (\"m\" + 1) of row (\"n\" + 1) of Pascal's triangle. A simplex \"A\" is a coface of a simplex \"B\" if \"B\" is a face of \"A\". \"Face\" and \"facet\" can have different meanings when describing types of simplices in a simplicial complex; see simplical complex for more detail.\n\nThe regular simplex family is the first of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as \"α\", the other two being the cross-polytope family, labeled as \"β\", and the hypercubes, labeled as \"γ\". A fourth family, the infinite tessellation of hypercubes, he labeled as \"δ\".\n\nThe number of 1-faces (edges) of the \"n\"-simplex is the \"n\"-th triangle number, the number of 2-faces of the \"n\"-simplex is the (\"n\" − 1)th tetrahedron number, the number of 3-faces of the \"n\"-simplex is the (\"n\" − 2)th 5-cell number, and so on.\n\nAn (\"n\" + 1)-simplex can be constructed as a join (∨ operator) of an \"n\"-simplex and a point, ( ). An (\"m\" + \"n\" + 1)-simplex can be constructed as a join of an \"m\"-simplex and an \"n\"-simplex. The two simplices are oriented to be completely normal from each other, with translation in a direction orthogonal to both of them. A 1-simplex is the join of two points: ( ) ∨ ( ) = 2 · ( ). A general 2-simplex (scalene triangle) is the join of three points: ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). An isosceles triangle is the join of a 1-simplex and a point: { } ∨ ( ). An equilateral triangle is 3·( ) or {3}. A general 3-simplex is the join of 4 points: ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). A 3-simplex with mirror symmetry can be expressed as the join of an edge and two points: { } ∨ ( ) ∨ ( ). A 3-simplex with triangular symmetry can be expressed as the join of an equilateral triangle and 1 point: 3.( )∨( ) or {3}∨( ). A regular tetrahedron is 4 · ( ) or {3,3} and so on.\n\nIn some conventions, the empty set is defined to be a (−1)-simplex. The definition of the simplex above still makes sense if \"n\" = −1. This convention is more common in applications to algebraic topology (such as simplicial homology) than to the study of polytopes.\nThese Petrie polygons (skew orthogonal projections) show all the vertices of the regular simplex on a circle, and all vertex pairs connected by edges.\n\nThe standard \"n\"-simplex (or unit \"n\"-simplex) is the subset of R given by\n\nThe simplex Δ lies in the affine hyperplane obtained by removing the restriction \"t\" ≥ 0 in the above definition.\n\nThe \"n\" + 1 vertices of the standard \"n\"-simplex are the points \"e\" ∈ R, where\nThere is a canonical map from the standard \"n\"-simplex to an arbitrary \"n\"-simplex with vertices (\"v\", …, \"v\") given by\nThe coefficients \"t\" are called the barycentric coordinates of a point in the \"n\"-simplex. Such a general simplex is often called an affine \"n\"-simplex, to emphasize that the canonical map is an affine transformation. It is also sometimes called an oriented affine \"n\"-simplex to emphasize that the canonical map may be orientation preserving or reversing.\n\nMore generally, there is a canonical map from the standard formula_9-simplex (with \"n\" vertices) onto any polytope with \"n\" vertices, given by the same equation (modifying indexing):\nThese are known as generalized barycentric coordinates, and express every polytope as the \"image\" of a simplex: formula_11\n\nA commonly used function from R to the interior of the standard formula_9-simplex is the softmax function, or normalized exponential function; this generalizes the standard logistic function.\n\n\nAn alternative coordinate system is given by taking the indefinite sum:\nThis yields the alternative presentation by \"order,\" namely as nondecreasing \"n\"-tuples between 0 and 1:\nGeometrically, this is an \"n\"-dimensional subset of formula_15 (maximal dimension, codimension 0) rather than of formula_16 (codimension 1). The facets, which on the standard simplex correspond to one coordinate vanishing, formula_17 here correspond to successive coordinates being equal, formula_18 while the interior corresponds to the inequalities becoming \"strict\" (increasing sequences).\n\nA key distinction between these presentations is the behavior under permuting coordinates – the standard simplex is stabilized by permuting coordinates, while permuting elements of the \"ordered simplex\" do not leave it invariant, as permuting an ordered sequence generally makes it unordered. Indeed, the ordered simplex is a (closed) fundamental domain for the action of the symmetric group on the \"n\"-cube, meaning that the orbit of the ordered simplex under the \"n\"! elements of the symmetric group divides the \"n\"-cube into formula_19 mostly disjoint simplices (disjoint except for boundaries), showing that this simplex has volume formula_20 Alternatively, the volume can be computed by an iterated integral, whose successive integrands are formula_21\n\nA further property of this presentation is that it uses the order but not addition, and thus can be defined in any dimension over any ordered set, and for example can be used to define an infinite-dimensional simplex without issues of convergence of sums.\n\nEspecially in numerical applications of probability theory a projection onto the standard simplex is of interest. Given formula_22 with possibly negative entries, the closest point formula_23 on the simplex has coordinates \nwhere formula_25 is chosen such that formula_26\n\nformula_25 can be easily calculated from sorting formula_28.\nThe sorting approach takes formula_29 complexity, which can be improved to formula_30 complexity via median-finding algorithms. Projecting onto the simplex is computationally similar to projecting onto the formula_31 ball.\n\nFinally, a simple variant is to replace \"summing to 1\" with \"summing to at most 1\"; this raises the dimension by 1, so to simplify notation, the indexing changes:\nThis yields an \"n\"-simplex as a corner of the \"n\"-cube, and is a standard orthogonal simplex. This is the simplex used in the simplex method, which is based at the origin, and locally models a vertex on a polytope with \"n\" facets.\n\nThe coordinates of the vertices of a regular \"n\"-dimensional simplex can be obtained from these two properties,\n\nThese can be used as follows. Let vectors (\"v\", \"v\", ..., \"v\") represent the vertices of an \"n\"-simplex center the origin, all unit vectors so a distance 1 from the origin, satisfying the first property. The second property means the dot product between any pair of the vectors is formula_34. This can be used to calculate positions for them.\n\nFor example in three dimensions the vectors (\"v\", \"v\", \"v\", \"v\") are the vertices of a 3-simplex or tetrahedron. Write these as\n\nChoose the first vector \"v\" to have all but the first component zero, so by the first property it must be (1, 0, 0) and the vectors become\n\nBy the second property the dot product of \"v\" with all other vectors is -, so each of their \"x\" components must equal this, and the vectors become\n\nNext choose \"v\" to have all but the first two elements zero. The second element is the only unknown. It can be calculated from the first property using the Pythagorean theorem (choose any of the two square roots), and so the second vector can be completed:\n\nThe second property can be used to calculate the remaining \"y\" components, by taking the dot product of \"v\" with each and solving to give\n\nFrom which the \"z\" components can be calculated, using the Pythagorean theorem again to satisfy the first property, the two possible square roots giving the two results\n\nThis process can be carried out in any dimension, using \"n\" + 1 vectors, applying the first and second properties alternately to determine all the values.\n\nThe volume of an \"n\"-simplex in \"n\"-dimensional space with vertices (\"v\", ..., \"v\") is\n\nwhere each column of the \"n\" × \"n\" determinant is the difference between the vectors representing two vertices. Another common way of computing the volume of the simplex is via the Cayley–Menger determinant. It can also compute the volume of a simplex embedded in a higher-dimensional space, e.g., a triangle in formula_42.\n\nWithout the 1/\"n\"! it is the formula for the volume of an \"n\"-parallelotope. \nThis can be understood as follows: Assume that \"P\" is an \"n\"-parallelotope constructed on a basis formula_43 of formula_44.\nGiven a permutation formula_45 of formula_46, call a list of vertices formula_47 a \"n\"-path if \n(so there are \"n\"! \"n\"-paths and formula_49 does not depend on the permutation). The following assertions hold:\n\nIf \"P\" is the unit \"n\"-hypercube, then the union of the \"n\"-simplexes formed by the convex hull of each \"n\"-path is \"P\", and these simplexes are congruent and pairwise non-overlapping. In particular, the volume of such a simplex is \n\nIf \"P\" is a general parallelotope, the same assertions hold except that it is no more true, in dimension > 2, that the simplexes need to be pairwise congruent; yet their volumes remain equal, because the \"n\"-parallelotop is the image of the unit \"n\"-hypercube by the linear isomorphism that sends the canonical basis of formula_44 to formula_52. As previously, this implies that the volume of a simplex coming from a \"n\"-path is:\n\nConversely, given an \"n\"-simplex formula_54 of formula_44, it can be supposed that the vectors formula_56 form a basis of formula_44. Considering the parallelotope constructed from formula_58 and formula_52, one sees that the previous formula is valid for every simplex.\n\nFinally, the formula at the beginning of this section is obtained by observing that \n\nFrom this formula, it follows immediately that the volume under a standard \"n\"-simplex (i.e. between the origin and the simplex in R) is\n\nThe volume of a regular \"n\"-simplex with unit side length is\n\nas can be seen by multiplying the previous formula by \"x\", to get the volume under the \"n\"-simplex as a function of its vertex distance \"x\" from the origin, differentiating with respect to \"x\", at formula_63   (where the \"n\"-simplex side length is 1), and normalizing by the length formula_64 of the increment, formula_65, along the normal vector.\n\nThe dihedral angle of a regular \"n\"-dimensional simplex is cos(1/\"n\"), while its central angle is cos(-1/\"n\").\n\nAn \"orthogonal corner\" means here that there is a vertex at which all adjacent edges are pairwise orthogonal. It immediately follows that all adjacent faces are pairwise orthogonal. Such simplices are generalizations of right triangles and for them there exists an \"n\"-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nThe sum of the squared (\"n\" − 1)-dimensional volumes of the facets adjacent to the orthogonal corner equals the squared (\"n\" − 1)-dimensional volume of the facet opposite of the orthogonal corner.\n\nwhere formula_67 are facets being pairwise orthogonal to each other but not orthogonal to formula_68, which is the facet opposite the orthogonal corner.\n\nFor a 2-simplex the theorem is the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with a right angle and for a 3-simplex it is de Gua's theorem for a tetrahedron \nwith an orthogonal corner.\n\nThe Hasse diagram of the face lattice of an \"n\"-simplex is isomorphic to the graph of the (\"n\" + 1)-hypercube's edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping to each of the \"n\"-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.\n\nThe \"n\"-simplex is also the vertex figure of the (\"n\" + 1)-hypercube. It is also the facet of the (\"n\" + 1)-orthoplex.\n\nTopologically, an \"n\"-simplex is equivalent to an \"n\"-ball. Every \"n\"-simplex is an \"n\"-dimensional manifold with corners.\n\nIn probability theory, the points of the standard \"n\"-simplex in (\"n\" + 1)-space are the space of possible parameters (probabilities) of the categorical distribution on \"n\" + 1 possible outcomes.\n\nSince all simplices are self-dual, they can form a series of compounds;\n\n\nIn algebraic topology, simplices are used as building blocks to construct an interesting class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These spaces are built from simplices glued together in a combinatorial fashion. Simplicial complexes are used to define a certain kind of homology called simplicial homology.\n\nA finite set of \"k\"-simplexes embedded in an open subset of R is called an affine \"k\"-chain. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with multiplicity. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite orientation, these are prefixed by a minus sign. If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.\n\nNote that each facet of an \"n\"-simplex is an affine (\"n\" − 1)-simplex, and thus the boundary of an \"n\"-simplex is an affine \"n\" − 1-chain. Thus, if we denote one positively oriented affine simplex as\n\nwith the formula_70 denoting the vertices, then the boundary formula_71 of \"σ\" is the chain\n\nIt follows from this expression, and the linearity of the boundary operator, that the boundary of the boundary of a simplex is zero:\n\nLikewise, the boundary of the boundary of a chain is zero: formula_74.\n\nMore generally, a simplex (and a chain) can be embedded into a manifold by means of smooth, differentiable map formula_75. In this case, both the summation convention for denoting the set, and the boundary operation commute with the embedding. That is,\n\nwhere the formula_77 are the integers denoting orientation and multiplicity. For the boundary operator formula_78, one has:\n\nwhere ρ is a chain. The boundary operation commutes with the mapping because, in the end, the chain is defined as a set and little more, and the set operation always commutes with the map operation (by definition of a map).\n\nA continuous map formula_80 to a topological space \"X\" is frequently referred to as a singular \"n\"-simplex. (A map is generally called \"singular\" if it fails to have some desirable property such as continuity and, in this case, the term is meant to reflect to the fact that the continuous map need not be an embedding.)\n\nSince classical algebraic geometry allows to talk about polynomial equations, but not inequalities, the \"algebraic standard n-simplex\" is commonly defined as the subset of affine (\"n\" + 1)-dimensional space, where all coordinates sum up to 1 (thus leaving out the inequality part). The algebraic description of this set is\n\nwhich equals the scheme-theoretic description formula_82 with\n\nthe ring of regular functions on the algebraic \"n\"-simplex (for any ring formula_84).\n\nBy using the same definitions as for the classical \"n\"-simplex, the \"n\"-simplices for different dimensions \"n\" assemble into one simplicial object, while the rings formula_85 assemble into one cosimplicial object formula_86 (in the category of schemes resp. rings, since the face and degeneracy maps are all polynomial).\n\nThe algebraic \"n\"-simplices are used in higher K-theory and in the definition of higher Chow groups.\n\nSimplices are used in plotting quantities that sum to 1, such as proportions of subpopulations, as in a ternary plot.\n\nIn industrial statistics, simplices arise in problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In the design of bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, in which case the feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential quadratic programming.\n\nIn operations research, linear programming problems can be solved by the simplex algorithm of George Dantzig.\n\nIn geometric design and computer graphics, many methods first perform simplicial triangulations of the domain and then fit interpolating polynomials to each simplex.\n\nIn chemistry, the hydrides of most elements in the p-block can resemble a simplex if one is to connect each atom. Neon does not react with hydrogen and as such is a point, fluorine bonds with one hydrogen atom and forms a line segment, oxygen bonds with two hydrogen in a bent fashion resembling a triangle, nitrogen reacts to form a tetrahedron, and carbon will form a structure resembling a Schlegel diagram of the 5-cell. This trend continues for the heavier analogues of each element, as well as if the hydrogen is replaced by halogen atoms.\n\n"}

Conversely, in the United States, individuals have to rely on health insurance policies in the event of hospitalization, and a minimal amount of state support for the poorer people exists. Another element can be public transport, as some countries have nationalized rapid transit systems, while others have privatized them (in the UK for example, public transport has been privatised in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland).\n\nEconomies with a more laissez-faire approach to employment will do nothing to provide job security. Other countries will rely on some degree of regulation to protect workers from arbitrary firings. A high degree of regulation such as expensive severance fees is often cited reason for making employers reluctant to hire and causing unemployment.\n\nUsed by the UK, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the South Asian countries the British model tends to have a welfare state of roughly average size, relative to high-income OECD countries, but less comprehensive than those in Scandinavia and much of continental Europe. They have somewhat more poverty and higher inequality. Despite having a smaller welfare state than most Western European countries, the UK, Ireland and Canada do provide, among other things, universal single payer health care, redistribute income and guarantee an income at subsistence level.\n\nUsed by Austria, France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, the Continental model has strict rules on job protection and a large amount of regulation in industry. However, the labour market has proven to be inflexible and slow to react to globalization. Generous insurance-based unemployment benefits and a well funded welfare state are used to reduce poverty and provide high quality health care. This model can generally be seen as middle ground between the British and Nordic models.\n\nUsed by Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, the Mediterranean model is similar to the Continental model, but focuses welfare on generous state-pensions. The labour market is inflexible with the same job protectionism as in the Continental model, but is not good at reducing poverty within the lower end of society.\n\nThe Nordic Model, mainly refers to Nordic countries Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland but some include the Netherlands, also called 'Nordic corporatist' model because of strong influence of the corporatist elements such as labor unions and employers' organizations, advocates a highly developed and government-funded welfare state which provides generous unemployment benefits among other resources for the general public. Labor markets are kept mobile with easy firing and hiring, and government taking care of those laid off with unemployment benefits and retraining. The equality of the Nordic model is achieved through progressive taxation. As a result of the policy, Sweden, Denmark and Norway have the lowest income disparities in the world. Nordic countries have been enjoying high economic and productivity growth, but most remarkably they consistently conquer top spots in world happiness surveys.\n\nBefore the Great Depression, the United States adhered to a social model that could be summarized by the term \"rugged individualism\": the understanding that because most people are capable of taking care of themselves, each person should be left to succeed or fail on their own, only fettered by the bounds of the law, and the government should be limited to protection of civil liberties. The United States had very little in the way of a social safety net for its citizens, with most people depending on their families and private social organizations if they were unable to provide for themselves; this partially explains the enduring greater emphasis on family and religion in American society and politics today than in other comparably developed countries in Western Europe.\n\nAs a result of increased modernization in the late 19th century, this view changed in the emergence of the Progressive Movement, which held that the government can and should have a greater role in regulating the economy, so as to promote a better life for all of its citizens. The biggest change came with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, during which time the American government intervened extensively in the economy, guided often by Keynesian economics. New programs included relief for the poor, unemployed, and those who cannot work due to youth, old age, or disability.\n\nHowever, since the Great Depression, the United States has not followed other developed democracies in the establishment of a more comprehensive model for assuring its citizens' well being. One possible explanation for this is that the U.S was not affected in the same way by World War II as Europe was: while Europeans relied on strong centralized governments to help rebuild their economies after two world wars, the United States was enjoying a period of unprecedented economic growth due to its being one of the few industrialized countries on the planet whose productive capacity had not been destroyed by enemy nations. But now, with the rise of industrial and geo-political competition in Europe and Asia, growing income inequality, high energy prices, and mounting public debt, there is renewed debate over the role of government in modern society.\n\nFor more comprehensive information, see \"Social programs in the United States\"\n\n\n"}

It recognizes that strategic planning is dynamic, that is, strategy-making involves a complex pattern of actions and reactions. It is partially planned and partially unplanned.\n\nA literature search shows the first of these senses to be both the earliest and most widely used meaning of ‘strategy dynamics’, though that is not to diminish the importance of the dynamic view of the strategy process.\n\nThe static assessment of strategy and performance, and its tools and frameworks dominate research, \ntextbooks and practice in the field. They stem from a presumption dating back to before the 1980s that market and industry conditions determine how firms in a sector perform on average, and the scope for any firm to do better or worse than that average. E.g. the airline industry is notoriously unprofitable, but some firms are spectacularly profitable exceptions.\n\nThe ‘industry forces’ paradigm was established most firmly by Michael Porter, (1980) in his seminal book ‘Competitive Strategy’, the ideas of which still form the basis of strategy analysis in many consulting firms and investment companies.\nRichard Rumelt (1991) was amongst the first to challenge this presumption of the power of ‘industry forces’, and it has since become well understood that business factors are more important drivers of performance than are industry factors – in essence, this means you can do well in difficult industries, and struggle in industries where others do well. Although the relative importance of industry factors and firm-specific factors continues to be researched, the debate is now essentially over – management of strategy matters.\n\nThe increasing interest in how some businesses in an industry perform better than others led to the emergence of the ‘resource based view’ (RBV) of strategy (Wernerfelt, 1984; Barney, 1991; Grant, 1991), which seeks to discover the firm-specific sources of superior performance – an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.\n\nThe debate about the relative influence of industry and business factors on performance, and the RBV-based explanations for superior performance both, however, pass over a more serious problem. This concerns exactly what the ‘performance’ \"is\" that management seeks to improve. Would you prefer, for example, (A) to make $15m per year indefinitely, or (B) $12m this year, increasing by 20% a year, starting with the same resources?\n\nNearly half a century ago, Edith Penrose (1959) pointed out that superior profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors – who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows – nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant – it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, Rugman and Verbeke (2002) have reviewed the implications of this observation for research in strategy. Richard Rumelt (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.\n\nThe essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.\n\nThis is not just of theoretical concern, but matters to executives too – efforts by the management of firm B to match A’s profitability could well destroy its ability to grow profits, for example. A further practical problem is that many of the static frameworks do not provide sufficiently fine-grained guidance on strategy to help raise performance. For example, an investigation that identifies an attractive opportunity to serve a specific market segment with specific products or services, delivered in a particular way is unlikely to yield fundamentally different answers from one year to the next. Yet strategic management has much to do from month to month to ensure the business system develops strongly so as to take that opportunity quickly and safely.\nWhat is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory – i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance. \n\nTo develop a dynamic model of strategy and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most of the relationships on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.\nSince a company’s sales clearly change over time, there must be something further back up the causal chain that makes this happen. One such item is ‘customers’ – if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.\n\nThe number of ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be calculated from anything else. It is one example of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or statistical observation, but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.\nDierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time:\n\nThe consequences of these features is that relationships in a business system are highly non-linear. Statistical analysis will not, then, be able meaningfully to confirm any causal explanation for the number of customers at any moment in time. If that is true then statistical analysis also cannot say anything useful about any performance that depends on customers or on other accumulating asset-stocks – which is always the case.\n\nFortunately, a method known as system dynamics captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).\nThe asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the ‘VRIO’ criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability. Yet day-to-day performance must reflect the simple, tangible resources such as customers, capacity and cash. VRIO resources may be important also, but it is not possible to trace a causal path from reputation or product development capability to performance outcomes without going via the tangible resources of customers and cash.\n\nWarren (2002, 2007) brought together the specification of resources [tangible and intangible] and capabilities with the math of system dynamics to assemble a framework for strategy dynamics and performance with the following elements:\n\n\nThis set of relationships gives rise to an ‘architecture’ that depicts, both graphically and mathematically, the core of how a business or other organization develops and performs over time. To this can be added other important extensions, including :\n\nAccording to many introductory strategy textbooks, strategic thinking can be divided into two segments : strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation is done first, followed by implementation.\n\nStrategy formulation involves:\nThis three-step strategy formation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.\n\nThe next phase, according to this linear model is the implementation of the strategy. This involves:\n\nSeveral theorists have recognized a problem with this static model of the strategy process: it is not how strategy is developed in real life. Strategy is actually a dynamic and interactive process. Some of the earliest challenges to the planned strategy approach came from Linblom in the 1960s and Quinn in the 1980s.\n\nCharles Lindblom (1959) claimed that strategy is a fragmented process of serial and incremental decisions. He viewed strategy as an informal process of mutual adjustment with little apparent coordination.\n\nJames Brian Quinn (1978) developed an approach that he called \"logical incrementalism\". He claimed that strategic management involves guiding actions and events towards a conscious strategy in a step-by-step process. Managers nurture and promote strategies that are themselves changing. In regard to the nature of strategic management he says: \"\"Constantly integrating the simultaneous incremental process of strategy formulation and implementation is the central art of effective strategic management\".\" (page 145). Whereas Lindblom saw strategy as a disjointed process without conscious direction, Quinn saw the process as fluid but controllable.\n\nJoseph Bower (1970) and Robert Burgelman (1980) took this one step further. Not only are strategic decisions made incrementally rather than as part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.\n\nHenry Mintzberg (1978) made a distinction between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy. Emergent strategy originates not in the mind of the strategist, but in the interaction of the organization with its environment. He claims that emergent strategies tend to exhibit a type of convergence in which ideas and actions from multiple sources integrate into a pattern. This is a form of organizational learning, in fact, on this view, organizational learning is one of the core functions of any business enterprise (See Peter Senge's \"The Fifth Discipline\" (1990).)\n\nConstantinos Markides (1999) describes strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation.\n\nA particularly insightful model of strategy process dynamics comes from J. Moncrieff (1999). He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned, though whether the resulting performance is better for being planned or not is unclear. The unplanned element comes from two sources : “emergent strategies” result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and “Strategies in action” are ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization. These multitudes of small actions are typically not intentional, not teleological, not formal, and not even recognized as strategic. They are emergent from within the organization, in much the same way as “emergent strategies” are emergent from the environment. However, it is again not clear whether, or under what circumstances, strategies would be better if more planned.\n\nIn this model, strategy is both planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. Five general processes interact. They are strategic intention, the organization's response to emergent environmental issues, the dynamics of the actions of individuals within the organization, the alignment of action with strategic intent, and strategic learning.\n\nThe alignment of action with strategic intent (the top line in the diagram), is the blending of strategic intent, emergent strategies, and strategies in action, to produce strategic outcomes. The continuous monitoring of these strategic outcomes produces strategic learning (the bottom line in the diagram). This learning comprises feedback into internal processes, the environment, and strategic intentions. Thus the complete system amounts to a triad of continuously self-regulating feedback loops. Actually, quasi self-regulating is a more appropriate term since the feedback loops can be ignored by the organization. The system is self-adjusting only to the extent that the organization is prepared to learn from the strategic outcomes it creates. This requires effective leadership and an agile, questioning, corporate culture. In this model, the distinction between strategy formation and strategy implementation disappears.\n\nSome detractors claim that these models are too complex to teach. No one will understand the model until they see it in action. Accordingly, the two part linear categorization scheme is probably more valuable in textbooks and lectures.\n\nAlso, there are some implementation decisions that do not fit a dynamic model. They include specific project implementations. In these cases implementation is exclusively tactical and often routinized. Strategic intent and dynamic interactions influence the decision only indirectly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44597344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44597344", "title": "Transposed letter effect", "text": "Transposed letter effect\n\nTransposed Letter Effect, in psychology, tests any effect on how a word is processed when two letters within the word are switched.\n\nThe phenomenon takes place when two letters in a word (typically called a base word) switch positions to create a new string of letters that form a new, non-word (typically called a transposed letter non-word or TL non-word). It is a form of priming (psychology) because the transposed letter non-word is able to activate the lexical representation of its base word. A non-word that is created by transposing letters in a base word is significantly more effective at being a prime for that base word than would be a prime created by exchanging letters from the base word with random letters that were not originally in the base word. For example, the TL non-word 'stduent' would be a more effective prime than would be the non-word 'stobent' for the base word student.\n\nPriming is an effect of implicit memory where exposure to a certain stimulus, event, or experience affects responding to a different stimulus. Typically, the event causes the stimulus to become more salient. The transposed letter effect can be used as a form of priming.\n\nWith any priming task the purpose is to test the initial stages of processing in order to better understand more complex processing. Psychologists use transposed-letter priming to test how people comprehend word meanings. From these findings, people can begin to understand how people learn, develop and understand language. Transposed-letter priming is used in a wide array of experiments and the reasons for using this method can depend on the particular hypothesis.\n\nSwitching the position of adjacent letters in the base word is a close transposition. This type of transposition creates the greatest priming effect. For example, an effective prime for the word \"computer\" would be the TL non-word \"comptuer\".\n\nForming a prime word by switching the position of nonadjacent letters in the base word is a distant transposition. There is significantly less priming effect in a distant transposition than a close transposition, no matter how distant the two letters are from each other.\n\nThe first study to test the transposed-letter effects was Burner and O’Dowd (1958). However, their experiment did not use priming. They showed participants a word that had a two letter switched either at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the word and they had to determine what the English word was. They measured their response time. Bruner and O’Dowd found that the error at the beginning created the slowest response time, the end was the next slowest and the middle was the fastest. The conclusion to this data was that the beginning and the end were more important for word recognition than the middle. From there, the transposition letter effect was used to test how people process and recognize words using many tasks.\n\nA study by Ziegler et al. (2013) demonstrated that baboons also show similar effects in regards to the transposed letter effect as humans. The purpose of the study was to find evidence to suggest that baboons use orthographic processing when reading. Previous research has considered transposed letter effects as strong evidence for orthographic processing (Grainger, 2008). Baboons were asked to classify strings of letters as either words or non-words by selecting certain shapes (for example, a circle for a word and a square for a non-word). The baboons were shown words they had previously learned and non-words. The non-words were created by using four-letter words, previously learned by the baboons, and either transposing the two middle letters or replacing the two middle letters with different letters (double substitute non-words). Baboons classified TL non-words as words significantly more often than double substitute non-words.\n\nThere are a number of theories that have been challenged by the effects shown with transposition-letter priming. These theories mainly have to do with how letters are used to process words.\n\nSlot-based coding theory states that each letter in a word is connected to a particular location, or slot, within that word. One of the major theories that predict letter slots is the interactive activation model created by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981). This model assumes that people are letter-position specific when detecting words, so our recognition of words is based on what letters it contains, where the letters are placed within that word and the length of the word itself. Another example is the bayesian reader model created by Norris (2006) which also assumes that the letters in a word are associated with their specific location. Many experiments (for example, Perea and Lupker, 2003) have shown if you use transposed-letter priming, (for example, priming judge with jugde) you will see a priming effect but if the prime is a word where two letters are changed to other letter (for example, priming judge with jupfe) there is no priming effect. According to the two models discussed we would assume jugde is no more similar to judge than jupfe because the letters are not in the correct slots. In another experiment, TL non-words were more likely to be (incorrectly) classified as actual words than are nonsense control words (Andrews, 1996). Andrew’s results are also inconsistent with the many slot-based coding models because even with two of the letters in the incorrect spot they read the word as if spelled correctly.\n\nThe parallel distributed processing model proposed by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) also uses a portion of words but instead of letters they are a small group of letters in the same order as in the word. For example, the word “judge” would have these groupings: _ju, jud, udg, dge, ge_. This predicts that if part of two words match there will be some priming, but this model still depends on the position of the letters to some extent, so it is not compatible with results from transposed-letter priming.\n\nThere are a number of theories that are supported by the results shown by the transposed-letter effect.\n\nThe SERIOL model (sequential encoding regulated by inputs to oscillations within letter units) described by Whitney (2001) explains processing of words as five levels, or nodes: retinal level, feature level, letter level, bigram level and word level. In the bigram level, the letters detected are turned into a number of pairs. For example, the word “cart” has the bigrams ca, ar, rt, ar, at and ct. The bigrams that more closely represent the location of letters in the words are given more weight. The pairs are then used to form the word. Within this model, letter location is still a factor but is not a defining feature of word processing, so the transposed-letter effect is consistent with this model.\n\nIn the SOLAR model (self-organizing lexical acquisition and recognition) described by Davis (1999) each letter is associated with its own level of activation. The first letter in the word has the highest level of activation and so on until the last word has the lowest level of activation. In this model, position does describe the level of activation for that particular letter but because the activation is successive, two letters beside each other would have a similar activation level. The SOLAR model is consistent with the results of the transposed-letter effect priming because with this effect experiments have shown priming when two adjacent letters are switched but not when two letters farther apart in the word are switched.\n\nTransposed-letter priming was used by Christianson, Johnson and Rayner (2005) on compound words to test the role of morphemes in word processing. They switched the letters either within the morphemes (for example, snowball to snowblal) or between morphemes (for example, snowball to snobwall) in the primes and found a greater priming effect within the morphemes than between. This supported the theory that morphemes are used during the processing of compound words because the priming effect was only reduced when the letters were switched over the morpheme boundary and were unable to separate into their separate parts.\n\n"}
{"id": "21632109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21632109", "title": "View (Buddhism)", "text": "View (Buddhism)\n\nView or position (Pali ', Sanskrit ') is a central idea in Buddhism. In Buddhist thought, a view is not a simple, abstract collection of propositions, but a charged interpretation of experience which intensely shapes and affects thought, sensation, and action. Having the proper mental attitude toward views is therefore considered an integral part of the Buddhist path, as sometimes correct views need to put into practice and incorrect views abandoned, and sometimes all views are seen as obstacles to enlightenment.\n\nViews are produced by and in turn produce mental conditioning. They are symptoms of conditioning, rather than neutral alternatives individuals can dispassionately choose. The Buddha, according to early texts, having attained the state of unconditioned mind, is said to have \"passed beyond the bondage, tie, greed, obsession, acceptance, attachment, and lust of view.\"\n\nThose who wish to experience nirvana must free themselves from everything binding them to the world, including philosophical and religious doctrines. Right view as the first part of the Noble Eightfold Path leads ultimately not to the holding of correct views, but to a detached form of cognition.\n\nThe term \"right view\" (' / ') or \"right understanding\" is basically about having a correct attitude towards one's social and religious duties. This is explained from the perspective of the system of karma and the cycle of rebirth. Used in an ethical context, it entails that our actions have consequences, that death is not the end, that our actions and beliefs also have consequences after death, and that the Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld or hell). Originating in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical concerns with sacrifice rituals and asceticism, in early texts the Buddha shifts the emphasis to a karmic perspective, which includes the entire religious life. The Buddha further describes such right view as beneficial, because whether these views are true or not, people acting on them (e.i. leading a good life) will be praised by the wise. They will also act in a correct way. If the views do turn out to be true, and there is a next world after death, such people will experience the good karma of what they have done when they were still alive. This is not to say that the Buddha is described as uncertain about right view: he, as well as other accomplished spiritual masters, are depicted as having \"seen\" these views by themselves as reality. Although devotees may not be able to see these truths for themselves yet, they are expected to develop a \"pro-attitude\" towards them. Moral right view is not just considered to be adopted, however. Rather, the practitioner endeavors to live following right view, such practice will reflect on the practitioner, and will eventually lead to deeper insight into and wisdom about reality.\n\nAccording to Indologist Tilmann Vetter, right view came to explicitly include karma and Rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when \"insight\" became central to Buddhist soteriology. This presentation of right view still plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism.\n\nA second meaning of right view is an initial understanding of points of doctrine such as the Four Noble Truths, not-self and Dependent Origination, combined with the intention to accept those teachings and apply them to oneself. Thirdly, a \"supramundane\" right view is also distinguished, which refers to a more refined, intuitive understanding produced by meditative practice. Thus, a gradual path of self-development is described, in which the meaning of right view gradually develops. In the beginning, right view can only lead to a good rebirth, but at the highest level, right view can help the practitioner to attain to liberation from the cycle of existence.\n\nBuddhist Studies scholar Paul Fuller believes that although there are differences between the different levels of right view, all levels aim for emotional detachment. The wisdom of right view at the moral level leads to see the world without greed, hatred and delusion.\n\nMisunderstanding objects as self is not only seen as a form of wrong view, but also as a manifestation of desire, requiring a change in character.\n\nThe Buddha of the early discourses often refers to the negative effect of attachment to speculative or fixed views, dogmatic opinions, or even correct views if not known to be true by personal verification. In describing the highly diverse intellectual landscape of his day, he is said to have referred to \"the wrangling of views, the jungle of views\". He assumed an unsympathetic attitude toward speculative and religious thought in general. In a set of poems in the early text Sutta Nipata, the Buddha states that he himself has no viewpoint. According to Steven Collins, these poems distill the style of teaching that was concerned less with the content of views and theories than with the psychological states of those who hold them.\n\n\n\n"}

Research by child development theorist Linda Kreger Silverman suggests that less than 30% of the population strongly uses visual/spatial thinking, another 45% uses both visual/spatial thinking and thinking in the form of words, and 25% thinks exclusively in words. According to Kreger Silverman, of the 30% of the general population who use visual/spatial thinking, only a small percentage would use this style over and above all other forms of thinking, and can be said to be true \"picture thinkers\".\n\nThe Dutch nonprofit organization the \"Maria J. Krabbe Stichting Beelddenken\" conducts research on \"beelddenken\". The \"Maria J. Krabbe Stichting\" has developed a test, named the \"Ojemann wereldspel\", to identify children who rely primarily on visual-spatial thinking. In this test, children are asked to build a village with toy houses and then replicate it a few days later. \n\nIn the Netherlands, there is a strong and growing interest in the phenomenon of 'true' \"picture thinking\", or \"beelddenken\". As a result of increased media coverage during the last few years, there is an acceptance of its existence by the general public, despite criticism from Dutch psychologists and development theorists, principally N. van Woerden and R. Wiers. Several websites and foundations are dedicated to \"beelddenken\".\n\nThinking in mental images is one of a number of other recognized forms of non-verbal thought, such as kinesthetic, musical and mathematical thinking.\n\nA common assumption is that people think in language, and that language and thought influence each other. Linguistics studies how language is used and acquired.\n\nThe strong version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis in linguistics states that language determines thought, and that linguistic categories alone limit and determine cognitive categories. Although Whorf himself framed linguistic relativity in terms of \"habits of mind\" rather than determinism, the revolutionary nature of his hypothesis was met with much misinterpretation and criticism. In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay rejected the strong hypothesis using a .\n\nSteven Pinker notes that we are not born with language, so that it is not likely that we are engineered to think in words alone.\n\nGardner's multiple intelligences theory recognises various forms of intelligence, namely spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic. Gardner's theory is discussed and cited in many of David A Sousa's 'How the Brain learns' series of books, including 'How the Gifted Brain learns' and 'How the Special Needs Brain Learns'. Areas of competence may be reinforcing, but also mutually exclusive. In today's society the link between IQ and education has weakened, but the idea of educated and intelligent has become synonymous, interchangeable; reinforced by verbalizers being better able to internalize information, advocate systems and design jobs that monetarily reward strengths, a cycle that is self-perpetuating.\n\nAccording to Roger Sperry the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere perform different tasks. The left and right hemisphere may be simultaneously conscious in different, even mutually conflicting, mental experiences that run in parallel. The right [non-verbal] hemisphere perceives, thinks, remembers, reasons, wills and emotes, all at a characteristically human level.\n\nResearch which builds on Sperry's split brain research is reinforced by anecdotal evidence, which supports the premise that different architectures lend themselves to one of the channels, at the expense of the others.\n\nSpatial-temporal reasoning is the ability to visualize special patterns and mentally manipulate them over a time-ordered sequence of spatial transformations. Spatial visualization ability is the ability to manipulate mentally two- and three-dimensional figures.\n\nSpatial-temporal reasoning is prominent among visual thinkers as well as among kinesthetic learners (those who learn through movement, physical patterning and doing) and logical thinkers (mathematical thinkers who think in patterns and systems) who may not be strong visual thinkers at all.\n\nEidetic memory (photographic memory) may co-occur in visual thinkers as much as in any type of thinking style as it is a memory function associated with having vision rather than a thinking style. Eidetic memory can still occur in those with visual agnosia, who, unlike visual thinkers, may be limited in the use of visualization skills for mental reasoning.\n\nPsychologist E.R Jaensch states that eidetic memory apart of visual thinking has to do with eidetic images fading between the line of the after image and the memory image. A fine relationship may exist between the after image and the memory image, which causes visual thinkers from not seeing the eidetic image but rather drawing upon perception and useful information. Individuals diagnosed with agnosia, may not be able to perform mental reasoning.\n\nThe acknowledgement and application of different cognitive and learning styles, including visual, kinesthetic, musical, mathematical and verbal thinking styles, are a common part of many current teacher training courses. Those who think in pictures have generally claimed to be best at visual learning.\n\nEmpirical research shows that there is no evidence that identifying a student's \"learning style\" produces better outcomes. There is significant evidence that the widespread \"meshing hypothesis\", the assumption that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style, is invalid. Well-designed studies \"flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis\".\nVTS allows teachers to teach reading with the use of complex visuals, rather than the print and individual text forms used in the past.\n\nResearch suggests that dyslexia is a symptom of a predominant visual/spatial learning. Morgan used the term 'word blindness,' in 1896. Hinselwood expanded on 'word blindness' to describe the reversing of letters and similar phenomena in the 1900s. Orton suggested that individuals have difficulty associating the visual with the verbal form of words, in 1925. Further studies, using technologies (PET and MRI), and wider and varied user groups in various languages, support the earlier findings. Visual-spatial symptoms (dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, auditory processing disorder (APD) and the like) arise in non-visual and non-spatial environments and situations; hence, visual/spatial learning is aggravated by an education system based upon information presented in written text instead of presented via multimedia and hands-on experience.\n\nVisual thinking has been argued by Temple Grandin to be an origin for delayed speech in people with autism. It has been suggested that visual thinking has some necessary connection with autism. Functional imaging studies on people with autism have supported the hypothesis that they have a cognitive style that favors the use of visuospatial coding strategies.\n\nConcepts related to visual thinking have played an important role in art and design education over the past several decades, but this has not always been the case. In Ancient Greece, Plato tended to place an emphasis on music to aid cognition in the education of heroes because of its mathematical tendencies and \"harmonies of the cosmos\". On the other hand, visual images, paintings in particular, caused the reliances on \"illusionary images\" However, in the Western world, children begin primary school with abstract thought and shapes, but as we grow older, according to Rudolf Arnheim, \"arts are reduced to a desirable supplement\" The general world trend in the late twentieth century caused an emphases towards scientific, mathematical, and quantitative approach to education, and art education is often refuted because it is based on perception. It is qualitative and subjective which makes it difficult to measure and evaluate.\n\nHowever, fundamentals in visual thinking lay the ground work for many design disciplines such as art and architecture. Two of the most influential aspects of visual composition in these disciplines are patterns and color. Patterns are not only prevalent in many different aspects of everyday life, but it is also telling about our interpretation of the world. In addition, there are now studied approaches to how color should be used in design where \"the functional aesthetics of colour can be reduced to a small number of guidelines and lists the main properties needed to make design decisions leading to visual clarity\".\n\nAt the same time, techniques in art and design can open up pathways to stimulate the thought process and problem solving. Sketches offer an unrestrained way to get thoughts down on paper through the \"abstract representations of ideas and idea structures\". In this way, sketching not only helps to generate ideas, but also to reflect and edit them as well. It is also an effective means of communication, especially for architects and engineers, for translating ideas from designer to client. Despite all the advantages of integrating art and visuals into education, it is a difficult skill to master. Those who can are well versed in visual analysis. It takes a lot of practice to have sketches evolve from \"meaningless scribbles\" to a complex \"thinking tool\".\n\n\n\n\nNetherlands\n"}

The hashtag was started by writer and domestic abuse survivor Beverly Gooden via Twitter in an effort to \"change the tone of the conversation.\" It began to trend nationally five hours after its creation and was used more than 46,000 times that day, according to the Web analytics tool, Topsy. #WhyILeft was a later addition to the Twitter conversation.\n\nBeverly Gooden's rationale for staying with her husband was that it was step one in her move to eventually leave her abusive relationship; Janay Rice, on the other hand, expressed that she has no intention of divorcing her now-husband and does not view herself as an abuse victim. In the wake of media attention after the release of the tape, Janay came out in support of Ray on Instagram, writing, \"To make us relive a moment in our lives that we regret every day is a horrible thing.\"\n\nBeyond the pull to stay together for the sake of their daughter, Rayven, Janay argued that the violent night in Atlantic City was an anomaly in their relationship. In an interview with ESPN, she said, \"As angry as I was, I knew it was something that we could move on from because I know Ray.\" She added that the violence was not one-sided; Janay was the one to initiate it, slapping Ray before he assaulted her. She stressed that she hopes people can see the love that the two have for one another despite one isolated incident, and how much they have grown because of it.\n\nOn November 8, 2014, creator Beverly Gooden posted the following message to her website to elaborate on her inspiration for #WhyIStayed:\n\n\"The internet exploded with questions about [Janay Rice] … why didn't she leave? Why did she marry him? Why did she stay? I can't speak for Janay Rice, but I can speak for Beverly Gooden. Why did I stay? … Leaving was a process, not an event. And sometimes it takes a while to navigate through the process. I believe in storytelling. I believe in the power of shared experience. I believe that we find strength in community. That is why I created this hashtag. I hope those tweeting using #WhyIStayed find a voice, find love, find compassion, and find hope.\"\n\nStories of why victims stayed varied from feeling unable to leave out of fear to not knowing that abuse was abnormal. Victims left because they realized their lives were in jeopardy, they started to believe they deserved better, and/or they wanted to protect their children.\n\nIn response to #WhyIStayed/#WhyIleft, Janay said she was thankful that her experience with domestic violence instigated the movement. Despite the difficulty of enduring the scrutiny that comes from the publicization of a private moment, Janay said that the fact that it began a conversation about abuse was a silver lining.\n\nThe hashtag gained significant attention from national media, as well as from the National Domestic Violence Hotline via Twitter. The organization thanked all who were sharing their stories with #WhyIStayed and informed users about their services.\n\nAfter #WhyIStayed became a trending topic on Twitter, it was mistakenly used by the DiGiorno's Pizza Twitter handle as a marketing effort. They tweeted, \"#WhyIStayed You had pizza.\" The administrator for the account later removed the tweet and apologized for the mistake, claiming that no one had looked into the implication of the trending hashtag before taking to Twitter. While many Twitter users brushed over the error, others were deeply angered as they believed DiGiorno was making light of an incredibly serious topic. In response, DiGiorno answered every negative tweet with personal messages conveying their apologies. DiGiorno has since removed the original tweet—but not before screenshots were taken to verify the event.\n"}
