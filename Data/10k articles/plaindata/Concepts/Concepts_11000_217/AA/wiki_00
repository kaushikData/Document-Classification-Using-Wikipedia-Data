{"id": "4575703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4575703", "title": "5 Whys", "text": "5 Whys\n\n5 Whys is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question \"Why?\". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The \"5\" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.\n\nNot all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.\n\nThe method provides no hard and fast rules about what lines of questions to explore, or how long to continue the search for additional root causes. Thus, even when the method is closely followed, the outcome still depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved.\n\n\nThe questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause. The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality in direct increments from the effect through any layers of abstraction to a root cause that still has some connection to the original problem. Note that, in this example, the fifth \"why\" suggests a broken process or an alterable behaviour, which is indicative of reaching the root-cause level.\n\nThe last answer points to a process. This is one of the most important aspects in the 5 Why approach - the \"real\" root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist. Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower. These answers may be true, but they are out of our control. Therefore, instead of asking the question \"why?\", ask \"why did the process fail?\"\n\nA key phrase to keep in mind in any 5 Why exercise is \"people do not fail, processes do\".\n\nThe technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and was used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies. It is a critical component of problem-solving training, delivered as part of the induction into the Toyota Production System. The architect of the Toyota Production System, Taiichi Ohno, described the 5 Whys method as \"the basis of Toyota's scientific approach by repeating why five times the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.\" The tool has seen widespread use beyond Toyota, and is now used within Kaizen, lean manufacturing and Six Sigma.\nIn other companies, it appears in other forms. Under Ricardo Semler, Semco practices \"three whys\" and broadens the practice to cover goal setting and decision making.\n\nTwo primary techniques are used to perform a 5 Whys analysis:\nThese tools allow for analysis to be branched in order to provide multiple root causes.\n\nIn order to carry out the 5 Whys analysis properly, the following advice should be followed:\n\nWhile the 5 Whys is a powerful tool for engineers or technically savvy individuals to help get to the true causes of problems, it has been criticized by Teruyuki Minoura, former managing director of global purchasing for Toyota, as being too basic a tool to analyze root causes to the depth that is needed to ensure that they are fixed. Reasons for this criticism include:\n\n\nThese can be significant problems when the method is applied through deduction only. To avoid these issues, it is recommended that the answer to the current \"why\" question is verified before proceeding to the next question. In addition, performing logical tests for necessity and sufficiency at each level can help avoid the selection of spurious causes and promote the consideration of multiple root causes.\n\n"}

The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are. This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language. Juliet compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he were not named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's love. This states that if he were not Romeo, then he would not be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all.\n\nIn Act II, Scene II of the play, the line is said by Juliet in reference to Romeo's house: Montague. The line implies that his name means nothing and they should be together. \nJuliet:\n\nO Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name;\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet\n\nRomeo:\n\n[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\n\nJuliet:\n\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other word would smell as sweet;\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\nAnd for that name which is no part of thee\nTake all myself.\n\nRomeo:\n\nI take thee at thy word:\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptized;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\nAlthough it is one of the most famous quotes from the work of Shakespeare, no printing in Shakespeare's lifetime presents the text in the form known to modern readers: it is a skillful amalgam assembled by Edmond Malone, an editor in the eighteenth century. \n\n\"Romeo and Juliet\" was published twice, in two very different versions. The first version of 1597, named \"Q1\", is believed to have been an unauthorised pirate copy or bad quarto provided to the printer by actors off the books: a memorial reconstruction. It may also, separately, represent a version of the play improved and trimmed after rehearsals for more dramatic impact.\n\nIt runs:\n\n’Tis but thy name that is mine enemy:\nWhat’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part.\nWhat’s in a name? That which we call a rose,\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\n\nQ2, a superior 1599 printing, is believed to be a more official version printed from Shakespeare's original manuscript although perhaps not with Shakespeare's personal input. This is believed since there are textual oddities such as \"false starts\" for speeches that were presumably not clearly crossed out enough for the printer to spot.\n\nIt uses the text:\n\n’Tis but thy name that is my enemy:\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague,\nWhat’s Montague? It is not hand nor foot,\nNor arm nor face. O be some other name,\nbelonging to a man!\nWhat’s in a name? That which we call a rose,\nBy any other word would smell as sweet.\n\nMalone reasoned that the awkward half-line of ‘belonging to a man’ could be reconnected into verse through correction with Q1. Modern editors have generally concurred.\n\n"}

It was named after the Créteil Abbey, as most gatherings took place in that suburb of Paris.\n\nL'Abbaye de Créteil group was a \"phalanstère\", a utopian community, founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter Albert Gleizes, and the poets , , Alexandre Mercereau and Charles Vildrac. The movement drew its inspiration from the \"Abbaye de Thélème,\" a fictional creation by Rabelais in his novel \"Gargantua\". It was closed down by its members early in 1908.\n\nGeorges Duhamel and Vildrac settled in Créteil, just to the southeast of Paris, in a house in a park-like setting along the Marne River. Their aim was to establish a place of freedom and friendship favourable for artistic and literary creativity.\n\nHenri-Martin Barzun (father of the historian and cultural critic Jacques Barzun) was a financial contributor to his friends at the \"Abbaye de Créteil\".\n\nIn an unpublished part of his Souvenirs Gleizes wrote that an initial idea for the Abbaye of Créteil was to escape from corrupt Western civilization to the simplicity of life in the South Seas, as he then believed Gauguin had done. (Robbins, 1964)\n\nThe group tried to create a publishing house that would bring in sufficient income to support the \"Abbaye\". The typographer , a friend of Albert Gleizes, furnished the printing press. From January 1907 through January 1908, some twenty books were published by the \"Abbaye\". Barzun, more sophisticated than the other idealists of the Abbaye, introduced Gleizes to the specific history of Utopian socialism. Though Gleizes did not enter the Abbaye with a specific program in mind. The art historian Daniel Robbins, is responsible for laying out the filiations between the Paul Fort's \"Vers et Prose\", the Abbaye, post-Symbolist writers and politically engaged aesthetic thinking that would lead Gleizes to Cubism. Robbin's pioneering work brought the history of the Abbaye to an Anglo-American readership. He characterized their endeavors as a 'search for a synthetic modern art' that gave expression to social ideas. In his 1964 Guggenheim essay on Gleizes, Robbins developed these notions and summarized them as:\n\nA synthetic view of the universe, presenting the remarkable phenomena of time and space, multiplicity and diversity, at once was his painted equivalent to the ideals which were verbally realized in the Abbaye poetry. (Robbins, 1964)\nMany artists visited the community and participated in its project, including the poet Pierre Jean Jouve; the musician ; the illustrator ; the painter ; , who had translated American poet Walt Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass\" into French; and the writer Jules Romains, founder of unanimism.\n\nThe fame of the Abbaye circulated even in Moscow, attracting many artists along the way. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Constantin Brâncuși were visitors there and young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend Cubism), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux are some of the artists who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye.\n\nThe Abbaye group, in principle supporting themselves through the communal work of publishing, were supported by many Symbolists. Yet its members soon began to break with the art forms practiced by the respected older generation. Like many Symbolists, the Abbaye artists \"scorned the structure of a bourgeois world and sought to substitute a communal society\", writes Robbins, \"but they did not reject the themes of modern life in favor of the Symbolist focus on single elements and internal, individual images\".\n\nThey wished instead \"to create an epic and heroic art, stripped of ornament and obscure allegory\", Robbins continues, \"an art dealing with the relevant subjects of modern life: crowds, man and machines, even, ultimately, the city itself\". The intentions of the Abbaye were vast and would ultimately remain unfulfilled. Their goal, like that of the Symbolists before them, was equivalent to an escape from reality. \"Yet there were important distinctions\", write Robbins, \"for the Abbaye intention to create a total future a priori ruled out the Symbolist technique of creating solely from an aesthetic or a closed ideal\".\n\nThe \"Abbaye\" attracted much interest but little revenue and its young members found themselves forced to close their beloved \"Abbaye\" on January 28, 1908. Its publishing house survived for a while and the friends continued to gather every month for a \"dîner des copains\" (in French, \"dinner of pals\").\n\nShortly after its dissolution, Gleizes moved to 7 rue du Delta near Montmartre, Paris, with artists , Amedeo Modigliani, Maurice Drouart and Geo Printemps.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3677766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3677766", "title": "Auctoritas", "text": "Auctoritas\n\nAuctoritas is a Latin word which is the origin of English \"authority\". While historically its use in English was restricted to discussions of the political history of Rome, the beginning of phenomenological philosophy in the 20th century expanded the use of the word.\n\nIn ancient Rome, \"Auctoritas\" referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence, and ability to rally support around his will. \"Auctoritas\" was not merely political, however; it had a numinous content and symbolized the mysterious \"power of command\" of heroic Roman figures.\n\nNoble women could also achieve a degree of Auctoritas. For example, the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Julio-Claudians had immense influence on society, the masses, and the political apparatus. Their Auctoritas was exercised less overtly than their male counterparts due to Roman societal norms, but they were powerful nonetheless.\n\nAccording to French linguist Emile Benveniste, \"auctor\" (which also gives us English \"author\") is derived from Latin \"\" (\"to augment\", \"to enlarge\", \"to enrich\"). The \"auctor\" is \"is qui auget\", the one who augments the act or the juridical situation of another.\n\n\"Auctor\" in the sense of \"author\", comes from \"auctor\" as founder or, one might say, \"planter-cultivator\". Similarly, \"auctoritas\" refers to rightful ownership, based on one's having \"produced\" or homesteaded the article of property in question - more in the sense of \"sponsored\" or \"acquired\" than \"manufactured\". This \"auctoritas\" would, for example, persist through an \"usucapio\" of ill-gotten or abandoned property.\n\nPolitically, \"auctoritas\" was connected to the Roman Senate's authority (\"auctoritas patrum\"), not to be confused with potestas or imperium (power), which were held by the magistrates or the people. In this context, \"Auctoritas\" could be defined as the juridical power to authorize some other act.\n\nThe 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen describes the \"force\" of \"auctoritas\" as \"more than advice and less than command, an advice which one may not safely ignore.\" Cicero says of power and authority, \"Cum potestas in populo auctoritas in senatu sit.\" (\"While power resides in the people, authority rests with the Senate.\")\n\nIn the private domain, those under tutelage (guardianship), such as women and minors, were similarly obliged to seek the sanction of their \"tutors\" (\"protectors\") for certain actions. Thus, \"auctoritas\" characterizes the \"auctor\": The pater familias \"authorizes\" – that is, validates and legitimates – his son's wedding \"in prostate\". In this way, \"auctoritas\" might function as a kind of \"passive counsel\", much as, for example, a scholarly authority.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic, during the days of the Roman Empire, the Emperor had the title of princeps (\"first citizen\" of Rome) and held the \"auctoritas principis\" – the supreme moral authority – in conjunction with the imperium and potestas – the military, judiciary and administrative powers.\n\nThe notion of auctoritas was often invoked by the papacy during the Middle Ages, in order to secure the temporal power of the Pope. Innocent III most famously invoked auctoritas in order to depose kings and emperors and to try to establish a papal theocracy.\n\nHannah Arendt considered \"auctoritas\" a reference to founding acts as the source of political authority in Ancient Rome. She took foundation to include (as \"augeō\" suggests), the continuous conservation and increase of principles handed down from \"the beginning\" (see also pietas). According to Arendt, this source of authority was rediscovered in the course of the 18th-century American Revolution (see \"United States of America\" under Founding Fathers), as an alternative to an intervening Western tradition of absolutism, claiming absolute authority, as from God (see Divine Right of Kings), and later from Nature, Reason, History, and even, as in the French Revolution, Revolution itself (see La Terreur). Arendt views a crisis of authority as common to both the American and French Revolutions, and the response to that crisis a key factor in the relative success of the former and failure of the latter.\n\nArendt further considered the sense of \"auctor\" and \"auctoritas\" in various Latin idioms, and the fact that \"auctor\" was used in contradistinction to – and (at least by Pliny) held in higher esteem than – \"artifices\", the artisans to whom it might fall to \"merely\" build up or implement the author-founder's vision and design.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "373023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=373023", "title": "Brahmacharya", "text": "Brahmacharya\n\nBrahmacharya (; Devanagari: ब्रह्मचर्य) is a concept within Indian religions that literally means \"conduct consistent with Brahma\". \n\nIn one context, \"brahmacharya\" is the first of four \"ashrama\" (age-based stages) of a human life, with \"grihastha\" (householder), \"vanaprastha\" (forest dweller), and \"sannyasa\" (renunciation) being the other three \"asramas\". The \"brahmacharya\" (bachelor student) stage of life – from childhood up to twenty-five years of age – was focused on education and included the practice of celibacy. In this context, it connotes chastity during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a \"guru\" (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (Sanskrit: \"moksha\").\n\nIn another context, \"brahmacharya\" is the virtue of celibacy when unmarried and fidelity when married. It represents a virtuous lifestyle that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.\n\nIn the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monastic traditions, \"brahmacharya\" implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage. It is considered necessary for a monk's spiritual practice. Western notions of the religious life as practiced in monastic settings mirror these characteristics.\n\nThe word \"brahmacharya\" stems from two Sanskrit roots:\n\nIn ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the term \"brahmacharya\" is a concept with a more complex meaning indicating an overall lifestyle conducive to the pursuit of sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation. \"Brahmacharya\" is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, ahimsa, simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors (including sexual behavior).\n\n\"Brahmacharya\" is traditionally regarded as one of the five yamas in Yoga, as declared in verse 2.30 of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. It is a form of self-restraint regarded as a virtue, and an observance recommended depending on an individual's context. For a married practitioner it means marital fidelity (not cheating on one's spouse); for a single person it means celibacy. Sandilya Upanishad includes \"brahmacharya\" as one of ten yamas in Chapter 1, defining it as \"refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body\".\n\nPatanjali in verse 2.38 states that the virtue of brahmacharya leads to the profit of \"virya\" (वीर्य). This Sanskrit word, \"virya\", has been variously translated as virility and, by Vyasa, as strength and capacity. Vyasa explains that this virtue promotes other good qualities. Other ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism describe the fruits of this virtue differently. For example, Pada Chandrika, Raja Marttanda, Sutrartha Bodhini, Mani Prabha and Yoga Sudhakara each state that \"brahmacharya\" must be understood as the voluntary restraint of power. Chandogya Upanishad in verses of chapter 8.5 extols \"brahmacharya\" as a sacrament and sacrifice which, once perfected, leads to realization of the soul or Self (Atman), and thereafter becomes the habit of experiencing the soul in others and everything. Tattva Vaisharadi and Yoga Sarasangraha assert that \"brahmacharya\" leads to and increase in \"jñana-shakti\" (power of knowledge) and \"kriya-shakti\" (power of action).\n\nThe great epic Mahabharata describes the objective of brahmacharya as knowledge of Brahman (Book Five, Udyoga Parva, the Book of Effort). Brahmacharya leads one to union with the Supreme Soul or Self (Chapter 43). By subduing desire, the practice of self-restraint enables the student to learn, pay attention in thought, word and deed to the \"guru\" (teacher), and discover the truth embodied in the Vedas and Upanishads. According to the epic, the practice of studying and learning requires the \"aid of time,\" as well as personal effort, ability, discussion, and practice, all of which are helped by the virtue of brahmacharya. A brahmacharya should do useful work, and the earnings he obtains should be given away as \"dakshina\" (\"fee,\" \"gift of thanks\") to the guru. The epic declares that brahmacharya is one of twelve virtues, an essential part of \"angas\" in yoga and the path of perfecting perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n\"Brahmacharya\" is one of the five major vows prescribed for the \"śrāvakā\" (layman) and ascetics in Jainism. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of \"brahmacharya\" requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner. For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage. \"Uttam Brahmacharya\" (Supreme Celibacy) is one of the ten excellencies of a \"Digambara monk\". \"Brahmacharya\" is mentioned as one of the \"das dharma\" (ten virtues) in ancient Jain texts like \"Tattvartha Sutra\", \"Sarvārthasiddhi\" and \"Puruşārthasiddhyupāya\".\n\nAmong the sramanic traditions (Buddhism, Jainism, Ājīvika and Carvaka schools ), \"brahmacharya\" is the term used for a self-imposed practice of celibacy generally considered a prerequisite for spiritual practice. The fourth of the five great vows of Jain monks, for example, is the vow of celibacy, which in this case means a total abstinence from the sensual pleasure of all five senses, including the avoidance of sexual thoughts and desires. The yogin who is firmly grounded in the virtue of \"brahmacharya\" is said to gain great vitality.\n\nHistorically \"brahmacarya\" referred to a stage of life \"(asrama)\" within the Vedic ashram system. Ancient Hindu culture divided the human lifespan into four stages: \"Brahmacharya\", \"Grihastha\", \"Vanaprastha\" and \"Sannyasa\". \"Brahamacharya asrama\" occupied the first 20–25 years of life roughly corresponding to adolescence. Upon the child's \"Upanayanam\", the young person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the Guru) dedicated to learning all aspects of \"dharma\" that is the \"principles of righteous living\". \"Dharma\" comprised personal responsibilities towards himself, family, society, humanity and God which included the environment, earth and nature. This educational period started when the child was five to eight years old and lasted until the age of 14 to 20 years. During this stage of life, the traditional vedic sciences and various sastras were studied along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. This stage of life was characterized by the practice of celibacy.\n\nNaradaparivrajaka Upanishad suggests that Brahmacharya (student) stage of life should extend from the age a child is ready to receive teachings from a \"guru\", and continue for a period of twelve years.\n\nThe graduation from Brahmacharya stage of life was marked by the Samavartanam ceremony. The graduate was then ready to either start Grihastha (householder) stage of life, or wait, or pursue a life of Sannyasa and solitude like Rishis in forest. Vyasa in Chapter 234 of Shanti Parva in the Mahabharata praises \"Brahmacharya\" as an important stage of life necessary for learning, then adds \"Grihastha\" stage as the root of society and important to an individual's success.\n\nThe Vedas and Upanishads do not restrict the student stage of life to males. Atharva Veda, for example, states\n\nGonda states that there were no age restrictions for the start of Brahmacharya in ancient India. Not only young men, but older people resorted to student stage of life, and sought teachers who were authoritative in certain subjects. The Chandogya Upanishad, in Section 5.11, describes \"wealthy and learned householders\" becoming Brahmacharis (students) with Rishi Kaikeya, to gain knowledge about Atman (Soul, inner Self) and Brahman (Ultimate Reality).\n\nThe Vedas discuss Brahmacharya, both in the context of lifestyle and stage of one's life. Rig Veda, for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions knowledge seekers as those with \"Kesin\" (long haired) and soil-colored clothes (yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of \"Mananat\" (mind, meditation). Rigveda, however, refers to these people as \"Muni\" and \"Vati\". The Atharva Veda, completed by about 1000 BC, has more explicit discussion of \"Brahmacharya\", in Book XI Chapter 5. This Chapter of Atharva Veda describes Brahmacharya as that which leads to one's second birth (mind, Self-awareness), with Hymn 11.5.3 painting a symbolic picture that when a teacher accepts a Brahmachari, the student becomes his embryo.\n\nThe concept and practice of \"Brahmacarya\" is extensively found among the older strata of the Mukhya Upanishads in Hinduism. The 8th century BC text Chandogya Upanishad describes in Book 8, activities and lifestyle that is Brahmacharya:\n\nA hymn in another early Upanishad, the Mundaka Upanishad in Book 3, Chapter 1 similarly states,\nThe Vedas and early Upanishadic texts of Hinduism in their discussion of Brahmacharya, make no mention of the age of the student at the start of Brahmacharya, nor any restraint on sexual activity. One of the earliest discussion and contrasting viewpoints on sexual intercourse during \"Brahmacharya\" is in section 11.5.4 of Satpatha Brahamana. The verses 11.5.4.16 and 11.5.4.17 present two different viewpoints on sexual activity, one against and one as a choice. Similarly, in verse 11.5.4.18, the Satapatha Brahamana presents contrasting viewpoints on an eating restraint for the Brahmachari.\n\nIn Indian traditions, a \"Brahmachari\" is a male and \"Brahmacharini\" a female.\n\nAmong Brahma Kumaris, \"Brahmacharya\" is practised by married couples and householders too, as a way of formalizing sexual behavior into a conscious, co-creative practice rather than merely an unconscious habit.\n\nIn ISKCON, a bhakti sect or devotional movement within Hinduism, a male devotee is called \"brahmachari\" and female devotee \"brahmacharini.\" The unmarried male \"brahmacharis\" wear saffron robes, while married male householders wear white robes. \"Brahmacharinis\" wear saris of any color. The terms \"brahmachari\" and \"brahmacharini\" are reserved for those practicing celibacy. Married devotees, in contrast, are called \"grihastha\" (householders).\n\nVarious \"Ashrams\" (आश्रम, hermitage) and \"Matha\" (मठ, college of ascetics) of various schools of Hinduism call their male and female initiates as Brahmachari and Brahmacharinis.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4677189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4677189", "title": "Clothing laws by country", "text": "Clothing laws by country\n\nClothing laws vary considerably around the world. In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed indecent exposure, public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.\n\nMost clothing laws concern which parts of the body must \"not\" be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some Islamic countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity. Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.\n\nSeparate laws are usually in place to regulate obscenity, which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and child pornography, which may include similar photographs of children.\n\nIn some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a dress code which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.\n\nThere are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a policeman on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a policeman's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the boy scouts uniform is also protected.\n\nIn most courts of law lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear court dress, which may entail robes or traditional wigs.\n\nIn many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as safety helmets, shoes, vests etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.\n\nGovernments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.\n\nIn addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the naked bike rides held in several countries.\n\nThere are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.\n\nIn some Islamic countries, women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see hijab).\n\nIn Australia, indecent exposure laws only refer to the genital area. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area. Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.\n\nOn public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbake topless without fuss.\n\nBreastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman.\n\nEver since 1940, in the Title VI of the Penal Code, naming crimes against sexual dignity (until 2009 crimes against [social] conventions), the fourth chapter is dedicated to a crime named \"public outrage [related] to modesty\" (, ).\n\nIt is composed of two articles, Art. 233 \"Obscene Act\", \"to practice an obscene act in a public place, or open or exposed to the public\", punished with arrest of 3 months to 1 year or a fine; and Art. 234 \"Obscene Written Piece or Object\", to do, import, export, purchase or have in one's property, to ends of trade, distribution or public display, any written, drawn, painted, stamped or object piece of obscenity, punished with arrest of 6 months to 1 years or a fine.\n\nIt is often used against people who expose their nude bodies in public environments that were not warranted a license to cater to the demographic interested in such practice (the first such place was the Praia do Abricó in Rio de Janeiro, in 1994), even if no sexual action took place, and it may include, for example, the chest area of women. Such a thing took place in FEMEN protests in São Paulo, in 2012.\n\nPervasive points of criticism to the legislation have included:\n\nBrazil has about 35 spaces open or mostly open to the public where it is possible to freely practice nudism, its sole public spaces being 8 beaches. They are not criminalized when the clothes-free area is private and away from a view from the street, or through legislation when the beaches are officiated by a municipal decree, for example. It has hosted the meeting of the International Federation of Naturism in 2008, and there is a growing interest in the practice.\n\nIn Canada, s.173 of the \"Criminal Code\" prohibits \"indecent acts\". There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act (other than that the exposure of the genitals for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age), \nso the decision of what state of undress is \"indecent\", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges to decide. Judges have held, for example, that nude sunbathing is not indecent. Also, streaking is similarly not regarded as indecent. Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends \"against public decency or order,\" in view of the public and \"without a lawful excuse.\" The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.\n\nToplessness is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in Guelph, Ontario while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent. The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense. Since then, the court ruling has been tested and upheld several times.\n\nA Canadian legal advice web site observes, \"Canada has a tangle of confusing and inconsistently-enforced nudity laws. . . . The public nudity section is one of the few areas of the Criminal Code that requires the attorney general’s consent to lay a charge, implying a certain grey area around what constitutes illegal nudity. According to the government’s Public Prosecution Service, the attorney general’s consent is needed for two reasons: to avoid the specific harm that could result from prosecuting an innocent person; and to avoid the general harm resulting from prosecuting a case that isn’t in the public interest. \n\nIn New Zealand, there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude \"and\" also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of obscenity laws.\n\nThe High Court of New Zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However in practice, the likelyhood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public \"beach\" is low, and in the past authorities have declined to prosecute topless and nude people on beaches.\n\nIn Qatar, the penal code punishes and forbids the wearing of revealing or indecent clothes, this dressing-code law is enforced by a government body called \"Al-Adheed\". In 2012, a Qatari NGO organized a campaign of \"public decency\" after they deemed the government to be too lax in monitoring the wearing of revealing clothes; defining the latter as \"not covering shoulders and knees, tight or transparent clothes\". The campaign targets foreigners who constitute the majority of Qatar's population.\n\nIn Singapore, nudity is illegal. Offenders will be charged under Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.\n\nIn South Africa specific clothing laws exist for the general public. Nudity is treated under indecent exposure. On 3 April 2015 the country's first official clothing optional beach, Mpenjati Beach near Trafalgar in KwaZulu-Natal, opened after the Hibiscus Coast Local Municipality approved the South African Nudist Association's (SANNA) application. Although nudity has gradually been tolerated on Sandy Bay in Cape Town after the National Party (NP) lost the election in 1994, and strict enforcement of its moral values is no longer applied, it is not an official legally recognised public nude beach. Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.\n\nSince 2008, the municipality of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach. This was said to be in response to residents' complaints about tourists sunbathing topless or nude and changing their clothes in public.\n\nThere are also signs at malls and shopping centers that advocates modest clothing which indicates that shoulders and knees must be covered, and public nudity is against the law. Violation of the law lead to a warning to cease and desist at first and would be followed with arrest if the person chooses to disobey the law.\n\nThere are three legal jurisdictions in the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland). There are a further three jurisdictions that are Crown dependencies (Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey). The details of the law regarding public nudity differ substantially between them. In general nudity is not an explicit offence but there are various offences that may apply to nudity in unsuitable circumstances. What constitutes unsuitable circumstances varies according to the jurisdiction but nudity is legal in a much wider range of circumstances than many people assume.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service has published guidance for England and Wales.\n\nBritish Naturism has published guidance for England and Wales, and Scotland. They are preparing guidance for Northern Ireland.\n\nIn England and Wales the two statutes most likely to be applicable are s.5 Public Order Act 1986, and for aggressive nudity s.66 Sexual Offences Act 2003.\n\nSee also:\n\nIn the United States of America there are variety of different offenses, such as \"indecent exposure\", \"public lewdness\", \"public indecency\", \"disorderly conduct\" and so on, may involve exposure of a specific body part (genitals, buttocks, anus, nipples on women), a specific intention or effect (being sexually suggestive, offending or annoying observers). In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present. In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception. There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having sexual intercourse in public, or publicly caressing someone in a sexual way. In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably erect penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing. In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act. In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by case law. Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as strip clubs.\n\nCase law in general governs the interpretation of the statutory definition, and in some cases allows for additional exceptions.\n\nIn general, exposure of the head, upper chest, and limbs is legal, and considered socially acceptable except among certain religious communities.\n\nFederal, state, and local regulations for certain occupations require various pieces of protective clothing for the safety of the wearer. Such items include hard hats, safety vests, life jackets, aprons, hairnets, and steel-toe boots.\n\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of trousers so low as to expose the underwear (sagging). The practice was banned in some places.\n\nSome states and towns have loose, or no, regulations for requiring clothing. The city of San Francisco has a history of public nudity, including at public events such as Bay to Breakers. The town of Brattleboro, VT experienced a brief period during which there was public nudity, until a law was passed banning it.\n\n"}

(\"ElektroTechnisches InformationsModell\", or electro-technical information model) is an initiative to standardize the electronic exchange of product data for electrical and electronic products (electrical installation products, home appliances and consumer electronics) to enable the electronic trading of these products. The standard is designed to meet the requirements of the electrical industry and allows for the uniform, technical description of electrical goods and their assignment to a class of products.\n\nThe ETIM Classification model is built using the following categories or entities:\n\nThe product groups each contain a set of product classes associated by theme. A product class can only be assigned to one product group. Within the product class, comparable or \"alike\" products are classified together. The name of an product class can have synonyms assigned in order to specify alternative names for the product class. The same synonym can be assigned to more than one product class. Each product class is assigned a list of features that unambiguously describe the product. This creates the ETIM classification.\n\nThis standardization allows suppliers of electrical goods to be found on the basis of class name (including synonyms) or of technical features.\n\nThe content of the ETIM model is identical in all member countries, which means that any ETIM class in use in a country has exactly the same features with the same identifying code for all the countries. However, in the past the release format was slightly different per country. Because this could and did indeed cause some confusion, ETIM decided to develop a new uniform international release format based on XML, a modern and flexible carrier for the ETIM model. Starting from ETIM 6.0 ETIM IXF will be considered THE international standard ETIM release format. The ETIM IXF format is multilingual, so it can contain multiple language versions of the ETIM model in one file. For the complete and detailed format description we refer to the separate document on ETIM IXF, which you can find in the download section of this website.\n\nEvery country can still decide to have additional country-specific release formats. The ETIM CMT master database already supports a range of exports formats like ASCII (TXT), CSV, ACCESS and EXCEL. Please contact your local ETIM organization for more information on country specific formats in your country.\n\nThe ETIM data model is completely uniform, differing only in the language.\n\nThe exchange format for classified product data, not to be confused with the release format for the data model, however is set and defined by each local ETIM organization individually. ETIM International recommends the BMEcat® standard, which is the most common exchange format within the ETIM countries. However, in some countries specific national formats are still in use and accepted as sector standard, sometimes in addition to BMEcat®.\n\n\nSince 1 January 2006 ETIM is a member of eCl@ss and vice versa. eCl@ss is the equivalent of ETIM in for field machines and plant construction. Both organizations have set a goal of unifying the classifications to a standard and are working together with the organizations VDMA, ZVEI, and the DIN.\n\n\n"}

An example was the Rydberg formula to predict the wavelengths of hydrogen spectral lines. Proposed in 1876, it perfectly predicted the wavelengths of the Lyman series, but lacked a theoretical basis until Niels Bohr produced his Bohr model of the atom in 1925.\n\nOn occasion, what was thought to be an empirical factor is later deemed to be a fundamental physical constant.\n\nSome empirical relationships are merely approximations, often equivalent to the first few terms of the Taylor series of the analytical solution describing the phenomenon. Other relationships only hold under certain specific conditions, reducing them to special cases of more general relationship. Some approximations, in particular phenomenological models, may even contradict theory; they are employed because they are more mathematically tractable than some theories, and are able to yield results.\n\n"}

In the case that someone was injured by the manufacturing activity, a court might apply the enterprise liability doctrine to allow recovery from the marketing corporation, which holds all the assets.\n\nThe doctrine emerged from litigation in the wake of the 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club fire. The doctrine is examined in \"Walkovsky v. Carlton\", 223 N.E.2d 6 (N.Y. 1966).\n\nEnterprise Liability has been used as alternative terminology for Industry-Wide Liability.\n\n\"Sindell v.

It can also mean keeping to one's promises no matter the prevailing circumstances. Literally, it is the state of being full of faith in the sense of steady devotion to a person, thing or concept.\n\nIts etymology is distantly related to that of fidelity; indeed, in modern electronic devices, a machine with high \"fidelity\" is considered \"faithful\" to its source material, whereas a spouse who, inside a sexually exclusive relationship, has sexual relations outside of marriage could equally be considered as being \"unfaithful\" as having committed \"infidelity\".\n\nFaithfulness in the marriage is a virtue in Christianity.

{"id": "475706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475706", "title": "Faurisson affair", "text": "Faurisson affair\n\nThe Faurisson affair was an academic controversy in the wake of a book by French scholar Robert Faurisson, a Holocaust denier. The scandal largely dealt with the inclusion of an essay by American linguist Noam Chomsky, entitled \"Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression\", as an introduction to Faurisson's book, without Chomsky's knowledge or approval. Responding to a request for comment in a climate of attacks on Faurisson, Chomsky defended Faurisson's right to express and publish his opinions on the grounds that freedom of speech must be extended to all viewpoints, no matter how unpopular or fallacious.\n\nHis defense was the target of subsequent accusations by various academics and groups. The accusers claimed that his defense went beyond free speech arguments, and that it included a defense of Faurisson's work, and in general they sought to discredit Chomsky by claiming that there was a deeper philosophical and political association between him and Faurisson.\n\nOn several occasions, Robert Faurisson has been convicted under French law for his speech. For instance, on October 3, 2006, he was sentenced to a three-month suspended sentence by the Paris correctional court, for denying the Holocaust on an Iranian TV channel.\n\nThe Faurisson affair greatly damaged Chomsky's reputation in France, a country he did not visit for almost thirty years following the affair, and where translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s.\n\nIn December 1978 and January 1979, Robert Faurisson, a French professor of literature at the University of Lyon, published two letters in \"Le Monde\" claiming that the gas chambers used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist.\n\nAs a result of a TV interview, he was found guilty of defamation and incitement to racial hatred and given a suspended 3-month prison term, and a 21,000-franc (€3,200) fine. In addition he was ordered to pay for the reproduction of the judgement in national newspapers and television. This latter requirement was dropped after he appealed.\n\nIn the fall of 1979, American scholar Noam Chomsky contributed his name to a petition—signed by roughly 600 people, including Serge Thion, Arthur Butz, John Tuson Bennett and Mark Weber—concerning the affair:\n\nDr. Robert Faurisson has served as a respected professor of twentieth-century French literature and document criticism for over four years at the University of Lyon-2 in France. Since 1974 he has been conducting extensive historical research into the \"Holocaust\" question.\nSince he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to a vicious campaign of harassment, intimidation, slander and physical violence in a crude attempt to silence him. Fearful officials have even tried to stop him from further research by denying him access to public libraries and archives.\nWe strongly protest these efforts to deprive Professor Faurisson of his freedom of speech and expression, and we condemn the shameful campaign to silence him.\nWe strongly support Professor Faurisson's just right of academic freedom and we demand that university and government officials do everything possible to ensure his safety and the free exercise of his legal rights.\n\nA number of French intellectuals criticized Chomsky's signing of the petition, describing the extent of Faurisson's Holocaust denial and his ties to neo-Nazi groups. In particular, Pierre Vidal-Naquet criticized the wording of the petition as \"scandalous\", saying that it implied Faurisson was a serious researcher and not a forgery:\nWhat is scandalous about the petition is that it never raises the question of whether what Faurisson is saying is true or false, that it even presents his conclusions or \"findings\" as the result of a historical investigation, one, that is, in quest of the truth. To be sure, it may be argued that every man has a right to lies and falsehood, and that individual freedom entails that right, which is accorded, in the French liberal tradition, to the accused for his defence. But the right that the forger demands should not be conceded to him in the name of truth.\"\n\nVidal-Naquet said that Faurisson was not barred from access to public libraries or archives, and the only archive to ban him was the private Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine (Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation) in Paris, which Vidal-Naquet sees as entirely consistent with its declared mission, \"the fact that the staff of the Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, challenged in its fundamental activity, that of the memory of the crime, should --after years of forbearance-- refuse to serve Faurisson seems perfectly normal to me\".\n\nChomsky subsequently wrote an essay entitled \"Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression\", in which he attacked his critics for failing to respect the principle of freedom of speech. Chomsky wrote:\nLet me add a final remark about Faurisson's alleged \"anti-Semitism.\" Note first that even if Faurisson were to be a rabid anti-Semite and fanatic pro-Nazi -- such charges have been presented to me in private correspondence that it would be improper to cite in detail here -- this would have no bearing whatsoever on the legitimacy of the defense of his civil rights. On the contrary, it would make it all the more imperative to defend them since, once again, it has been a truism for years, indeed centuries, that it is precisely in the case of horrendous ideas that the right of free expression must be most vigorously defended; it is easy enough to defend free expression for those who require no such defense. Putting this central issue aside, is it true that Faurisson is an anti-Semite or a neo-Nazi? As noted earlier, I do not know his work very well. But from what I have read -- largely as a result of the nature of the attacks on him -- I find no evidence to support either conclusion. Nor do I find credible evidence in the material that I have read concerning him, either in the public record or in private correspondence. As far as I can determine, he is a relatively apolitical liberal of some sort.\n\nChomsky granted permission for the essay to be used for any purpose. Serge Thion and Pierre Guillaume then used it as a preface when publishing a book by Faurisson, without Chomsky's knowledge. Later Chomsky requested that the essay not be used in this manner, since he believed the French intellectual community was so incapable of understanding freedom of speech that it would only confuse them further, but his request came too late for the book to be changed. Chomsky subsequently said that asking for the preface to be removed is his one regret in the matter.\n\nChomsky's essay sparked an even greater controversy. Critics such as Pierre Vidal-Naquet attacked him not for defending the principle of freedom of speech, but for allegedly defending Faurisson personally against charges of anti-Semitism and upholding his work as historical inquiry:\nThe simple truth, Noam Chomsky, is that you were unable to abide by the ethical maxim you had imposed. You had the right to say: my worst enemy has the right to be free, on condition that he not ask for my death or that of my brothers. You did not have the right to say: my worst enemy is a comrade, or a \"relatively apolitical sort of liberal.\" You did not have the right to take a falsifier of history and to recast him in the colors of truth.\n\nVidal-Naquet offered the following argument to substantiate his characterisation of Faurisson as an antisemite:\nI shall simply say: Faurisson's personal anti-Semitism, in fact, interests me rather little. It exists and I can testify to it, but it is nothing compared with the anti- Semitism of his texts. Is it anti-Semitic to write with consummate calm that in requiring Jews to wear the yellow star starting at the age of six \"Hitler was perhaps less concerned with the Jewish question than with ensuring the safety of German soldiers\"? Certainly not, within Faurisson's logic, since in the final analysis there is no practical anti-Semitism possible. But within Chomsky's logic? Is the invention of an imaginary declaration of war against Hitler, in the name of the international Jewish community, by an imaginary president of the World Jewish Congress, a case of anti-Semitism or of deliberate falsification?\n\nJohn Goldsmith writes that \"Unsympathetic critics used it as an opportunity to brand Chomsky with anti-Semitic labels, but even critics potentially sympathetic to Chomsky's political views felt his remarks showed lack of judgment.\"\n\nOther critics held that Faurisson's statements were the archetype of anti-Semitism, and that the logical conclusion of Chomsky's statement would be that Nazism was not anti-Semitic. The main argument for this is that Holocaust deniers are not interested in truth, but \"motivated by racism, extremism, and virulent anti-Semitism\".\n\nIn a response to a letter circa 1989–1991, Chomsky stated:\nA professor of French literature was suspended from teaching on grounds that he could not be protected from violence, after privately printing pamphlets questioning the existence of gas chambers. He was then brought to trial for \"falsification of History,\" and later condemned for this crime, the first time that a modern Western state openly affirmed the Stalinist-Nazi doctrine that the state will determine historical truth and punish deviation from it. Later he was beaten practically to death by Jewish terrorists. As of now, the European and other intellectuals have not expressed any opposition to these scandals; rather, they have sought to disguise their profound commitment to Stalinist-Nazi doctrine by following the same models, trying to divert attention with a flood of outrageous lies.\n\nIn \"His Right to Say It\", published in \"The Nation\", Chomsky stressed the conceptual distinction between \"endorsing\" someone's view and \"defending\" his right to say it:\nVidal-Naquet misunderstood a sentence in the petition that ran, \"Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to...\" The term \"findings\" is quite neutral. One can say, without contradiction: \"He made his findings public and they were judged worthless, irrelevant, falsified...\" The petition implied nothing about quality of Faurisson's work, which was irrelevant to the issues raised. [...]<br>\n<br>\nI made it explicit that I would not discuss Faurisson's work, having only limited familiarity with it (and, frankly, little interest in it). Rather, I restricted myself to the civil-liberties issues and the implications of the fact that it was even necessary to recall Voltaire's famous words in a letter to M. le Riche: \"I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.\" [...] Many writers find it scandalous that I should support the right of free expression for Faurisson without carefully analyzing his work, a strange doctrine which, if adopted, would effectively block defense of civil rights for unpopular views. [...]<br>\n<br>\nIt seems to me something of a scandal that it is even necessary to debate these issues two centuries after Voltaire defended the right of free expression for views he detested. It is a poor service to the memory of the victims of the holocaust to adopt a central doctrine of their murderers.\n\nChomsky's biographers have expressed a range of views on the Faurisson affair. In \"Chomsky: Ideas and ideals\", Neil Smith writes: 'Chomsky should perhaps have foreseen the negative effect of his activity and refrained from writing the way he did. Perhaps, but on balance perhaps not. Even had he seen the furore which would erupt and the degree that would ensue, the moral doctrine of defending freedom of speech is probably higher.' \n\nIn \"Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent\", Robert Barsky says 'Chomsky's tactics may not always be the most appropriate in light of the causes that he supports but the values transmitted by his work are, according to virtually any reasonable measure, consistent with those of the libertarians.' Barsky also points out that although the Faurisson affair 'has had a harmful and lasting effect on Chomsky … Chomsky has refused to back down on the issue, even refusing to admit a momentary lack of judgment.'\n\nTwo other biographers, Milan Rai and Chris Knight, both refer to the Faurisson affair in the context of Chomsky's uncompromising support for academic freedom for everyone including 'war criminals'. In \"Chomsky's Politics\", Milan Rai quotes Chomsky saying that he even 'supported the rights of American war criminals not only to speak and teach but also to conduct their research, on grounds of academic freedom, at a time when their work was being used to murder and destroy.' \n\nIn \"Decoding Chomsky\", Chris Knight refers to Chomsky's 1969 threat to 'protest publicly' if fellow MIT academic, Walt Rostow, was denied a position at the university. Chomsky certainly saw Rostow, a prime architect of the Vietnam War, as a 'war criminal'. Yet he insisted that MIT must stick to its principles of academic freedom - principles expressed when MIT's President Johnson stated that the university should be a 'refuge from the censor, where any individual can pursue truth as he sees it, without any interference.'\n\nHoward Johnson's motivation for talking about academic freedom at this time of anti-war student unrest was largely to prevent any interference with MIT's various military-funded research laboratories. But, Knight claims, Chomsky also felt he had to extend the principle of academic freedom to unusual lengths because any 'less libertarian policy might have undermined his own conflicted position as an anti-war campaigner working in a laboratory funded by the US military.' Knight concludes that Chomsky's subsequent position on Faurisson 'did not imply any sympathy towards Holocaust denial. It was simply a logical extension of a principle common to all Western universities – one which his management at MIT felt obliged to uphold with special tenacity in view of what its own researchers were doing.'\n\n\nVideo\n"}

{"id": "24780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24780", "title": "Five precepts", "text": "Five precepts\n\nThe five precepts (; ) or five rules of training (; ) is the most important system of morality for Buddhist lay people. They constitute the basic code of ethics undertaken by lay followers of Buddhism. The precepts are commitments to abstain from killing living beings, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Within the Buddhist doctrine, they are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to enlightenment. They are sometimes referred to as the śrāvakayāna precepts in the Mahāyāna tradition, contrasting them with the \"bodhisattva\" precepts. The five precepts form the basis of several parts of Buddhist doctrine, both lay and monastic. With regard to their fundamental role in Buddhist ethics, they have been compared with the ten commandments in Christianity or the ethical codes of Confucianism. The precepts have been connected with utilitarianist, deontological and virtue approaches to ethics. They have been compared with human rights because of their universal nature, and some scholars argue they can complement the concept of human rights.\n\nThe five precepts were common to the religious milieu of 6th-century BCE India, but the Buddha's focus on awareness through the fifth precept was unique. As shown in Early Buddhist Texts, the precepts grew to be more important, and finally became a condition for membership of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries where Buddhism had to compete with other religions, such as China, the ritual of undertaking the five precepts developed into an initiation ceremony to become a Buddhist lay person. On the other hand, in countries with little competition from other religions, such as Thailand, the ceremony has had little relation to the rite of becoming Buddhist, as many people are presumed Buddhist from birth.\n\nUndertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of non-harming (Pāli and ). The Pali Canon recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in karmic retribution form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. People keep them with an intention to develop themselves, but also out of fear of a bad rebirth.\n\nThe first precept consists of a prohibition of killing, both humans and all animals. Scholars have interpreted Buddhist texts about the precepts as an opposition to and prohibition of capital punishment, suicide, abortion and euthanasia. In practice, however, many Buddhist countries still use the death penalty. With regard to abortion, Buddhist countries take the middle ground, by condemning though not prohibiting it. The Buddhist attitude to violence is generally interpreted as opposing all warfare, but some scholars have raised exceptions. The second precept prohibits theft. The third precept refers to adultery in all its forms, and has been defined by modern teachers with terms such as \"sexual responsibility\" and \"long-term commitment\". The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action, as well as malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip. The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means. Early Buddhist Texts nearly always condemn alcohol, and so do Chinese Buddhist post-canonical texts. Buddhist attitudes toward smoking differ per time and region, but are generally permissive. In modern times, traditional Buddhist countries have seen revival movements to promote the five precepts. As for the West, the precepts play a major role in Buddhist organizations. They have also been integrated in mindfulness training programs, though many mindfulness specialists do not support this because of the precepts' religious import. Lastly, many conflict prevention programs make use of the precepts.\n\nBuddhist scriptures explain the five precepts as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality. It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the monastic rules. \"Śīla\" (Sanskrit; ) is used to refer to Buddhist precepts, including the five. But the word also refers to the virtue and morality which lies at the foundation of the spiritual path to enlightenment, which is the first of the three forms of training on the path. Thus, the precepts are rules or guidelines to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to enlightenment. The five precepts are part of the right speech, action and livelihood aspects of the eight-fold path, the core teaching of Buddhism. Moreover, the practice of the five precepts and other parts of \"śīla\" are described as forms of merit-making, means to create good karma. The five precepts have been described as social values that bring harmony to society, and breaches of the precepts described as antithetical to a harmonious society. On a smilar note, in Buddhist texts, the ideal, righteous society is one in which people keep five precepts.\n\nComparing different parts of Buddhist doctrine, the five precepts form the basis of the eight precepts, which are lay precepts stricter than the five precepts, similar to monastic precepts. Secondly, the five precepts form the first half of the ten or eleven precepts for a person aiming to become a Buddha (\"bodhisattva\"), as mentioned in the \"Brahmajala Sūtra\" of the Mahāyāna tradition. Contrasting these precepts with the five precepts, the latter were commonly referred to by Mahāyānists as the \"śrāvakayāna\" precepts, or the precepts of those aiming to become enlightened disciples of a Buddha, but not Buddhas themselves. The teneleven \"bodhisattva\" precepts presuppose the five precepts, and are partly based on them. The five precepts are also partly found in the teaching called the ten good courses of action, referred to in Theravāda () and Tibetan Buddhism (; ). Finally, the first four of the five precepts are very similar to the most fundamental rules of monastic discipline, and may have influenced their development.\n\nIn conclusion, the five precept lie at the foundation of all Buddhist practice, and in that respect, can be compared with the ten commandments in Christianity or the ethical codes of Confucianism.\n\nThe five precepts were part of early Buddhism and are common to nearly all schools of Buddhism. In early Buddhism, the five precepts were regarded as an ethic of restraint, to restrain unwholesome tendencies and thereby purify one's being to attain enlightenment. The five precepts were based on the \"pañcaśīla\", prohibitions for pre-Buddhist Brahmanic priests, which were adopted in many Indic religions around 6th century BCE. The first four Buddhist precepts were nearly identical to these \"pañcaśīla\", but the fifth precept, the prohibition on intoxication, was new in Buddhism: the Buddha's emphasis on awareness () was unique.\n\nIn some schools of ancient Indic Buddhism, Buddhist devotees could choose to adhere to only a number of precepts, instead of the complete five. The schools that would survive in later periods, however, that is Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, were both ambiguous about this practice. Some early Mahāyāna texts allow it, but some do not; Theravāda texts do not discuss this practice at all.\n\nThe prohibition on killing has motivated early Buddhists to form a stance against animal sacrifice, a common ritual practice in ancient India. According to the Pāli Canon, however, early Buddhists did not adopt a vegetarian lifestyle.\n\nIn Early Buddhist Texts, the role of the five precepts gradually develops. First of all, the precepts are combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, his teaching and the monastic community). Next, the precepts develop to become the foundation of lay practice. The precepts are seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind. At a third stage in the texts, the precepts are actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they are part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, become a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people have to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.\n\nIn China, the five precepts were introduced in the first centuries CE, both in their \"śrāvakayāna\" and \"bodhisattva\" formats. During this time, it was particularly Buddhist teachers who promoted abstinence from alcohol (the fifth precept), since Daoism and other thought systems emphasized moderation rather than full abstinence. Chinese Buddhists interpreted the fifth precept strictly, even more so than in Indic Buddhism. For example, the monk Daoshi ( 600–83) dedicated large sections of his encyclopedic writings to abstinence from alcohol. However, in some parts of China, such as Dunhuang, considerable evidence has been found of alcohol consumption among both lay people and monastics. Later, from the 8th century onward, strict attitudes of abstinence led to a development of a distinct tea culture among Chinese monastics and lay intellectuals, in which tea gatherings replaced gatherings with alcoholic beverages, and were advocated as such. These strict attitudes were formed partly because of the religious writings, but may also have been affected by the bloody An Lushan Rebellion of 775, which had a sobering effect on 8th-century Chinese society. When the five precepts were integrated in Chinese society, they were associated and connected with karma, Chinese cosmology and medicine, a Daoist worldview, and Confucian virtue ethics.\n\nIn the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are recited in a standardized fashion, using Pāli language. In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts by reciting the following three times:\n\nAfter this, the monk administering the precepts will recite a reverential line of text to introduce the ceremony, after which he guides the lay people in declaring that they take their refuge in the three refuges or triple gem.\n\nHe then continues with reciting the five precepts:\n\nIn the fifth precept \"sura\", \"meraya\" and \"majja\" are kinds of alcoholic beverages. In some modern translations, \"Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā\", is rendered more broadly, variously, as, \"intoxicants\" or \"liquor and drugs\", etc.\n\nAfter the lay people have repeated the five precepts after the monk, the monk will close the ceremony reciting:\n\nThe format of the ceremony for taking the precepts occurs several times in the Chinese Buddhist Canon, in slightly different forms.\n\nOne formula of the precepts can be found in the \"Treatise on Taking Refuge and the Precepts\" ():\n\n\nSimilarly, in the Mūla-Sarvāstivāda texts used in Tibetan Buddhism, the precepts are formulated such that one takes the precepts upon oneself for one's entire lifespan, following the examples of the enlightened disciples of the Buddha (\"arahant\").\n\nThe five precepts can be found in many places in the Early Buddhist Texts. The precepts are regarded as means to building good character, or as an expression of such character. The Pāli Canon describes them as means to avoid harm to oneself and others. It further describes them as gifts toward oneself and others. Moreover, the texts say that people who uphold them will be confident in any gathering of people, will have wealth and a good reputation, and will die a peaceful death, reborn in heaven or as a human being. On the other hand, living a life in violation of the precepts is believed to lead to rebirth in an unhappy destination. They are understood as principles that define a person as human in body and mind.\n\nThe precepts are normative rules, but are formulated and understood as \"undertakings\" rather than commandments enforced by a moral authority, according to the voluntary and gradualist standards of Buddhist ethics. They are forms of restraint formulated in negative terms, but are also accompanied by virtues and positive behaviors, which are cultivated through the practice of the precepts. The most important of these virtues is non-harming (Pāli and ), which underlies all of the five precepts. Precisely, the texts say that one should keep the precepts, adhering to the principle of comparing oneself with others:\nIn other words, all living beings are alike in that they want to be happy and not suffer. Comparing oneself with others, one should therefore not hurt others as one would not want to be hurt. Ethicist Pinit Ratanakul argues that the compassion which motivates upholding the precepts comes from an understanding that all living beings are equal and of a nature that they are 'not-self' (). Another aspect that is fundamental to this is the belief in karmic retribution.\n\nIn the upholding or violation of the precepts, intention is crucial. In the Pāli scriptures, an example is mentioned of a person stealing an animal only to set it free, which was not seen as an offense of theft. In the Pāli commentaries, a precept is understood to be violated when the person violating it finds the object of the transgression (e.g. things to be stolen), is aware of the violation, has the intention to violate it, does actually act on that intention, and does so successfully.\n\nUpholding the precepts is sometimes distinguished in three levels: to uphold them without having formally undertaken them; to uphold them formally, willing to sacrifice one's own life for it; and finally, to spontaneously uphold them. The latter refers to the \"arahant\", who is understood to be morally incapable of violating the first four precepts. A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a \"jewel among laymen\". On the other hand, the most serious violations of the precepts are the five actions of immediate retribution, which are believed to lead the perpetrator to an unavoidable rebirth in hell. These consist of injuring a Buddha, killing an \"arahant\", killing one's father or mother, and causing the monastic community to have a schism.\n\nLay followers often undertake these training rules in the same ceremony as they take the refuges. Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect. Buddhist lay people may recite the precepts regularly at home, and before an important ceremony at the temple to prepare the mind for the ceremony.\n\nThe five precepts are at the core of Buddhist morality. In field studies in some countries like Sri Lanka, villagers describe them as the core of the religion. Anthropologist found in his fieldwork that most Thai villagers knew the precepts by heart, and many, especially the elderly, could explain the implications of the precepts following traditional interpretations.\n\nNevertheless, Buddhists do not all follow them with the same strictness. Devotees who have just started keeping the precepts will typically have to exercise considerable restraint. When they become used to the precepts, they start to embody them more naturally. Researchers doing field studies in traditional Buddhist societies have found that the five precepts are generally considered demanding and challenging. For example, in a 1997 survey in Thailand, only 13.8% of the respondents indicated they adhered to the five precepts in their daily lives, with the fourth and fifth precept least likely to be adhered to. Yet, people do consider the precepts worth striving for, and do uphold them out of fear of bad karma and being reborn in hell, or because they believe in that the Buddha issued these rules, and that they therefore should be maintained. Anthropologist Melford Spiro found that Burmese Buddhists mostly upheld the precepts to avoid bad karma, as opposed to expecting to gain good karma. Religion scholar Winston King observed from his field studies that the moral principles of Burmese Buddhists were based on personal self-developmental motives rather than other-regarding motives. Religion scholar Richard Jones concludes that the moral motives of Buddhists in adhering to the precepts are based on the idea that renouncing self-service, ironically, serves oneself.\n\nIn East Asian Buddhism, the precepts are intrinsically connected with the initiation as a Buddhist lay person. Early Chinese translations such as the \"Upāsaka-śila Sūtra\" hold that the precepts should only be ritually transmitted by a monastic. The texts describe that in the ritual the power of the Buddhas and \"bodhisattvas\" is transmitted, and helps the initiate to keep the precepts. This \"lay ordination\" ritual usually occurs after a stay in a temple, and often after a monastic ordination has taken place. The ordained lay person is then given a religious name. The restrictions that apply are similar to a monastic ordination, such as permission from parents.\n\nIn the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are usually taken \"each separately\" (), to indicate that if one precept should be broken, the other precepts are still intact. In very solemn occasions, or for very pious devotees, the precepts may be taken as a group rather than each separately. This does not mean, however, that only some of the precepts can be undertaken; they are always committed to as a complete set. In East Asian Buddhism, however, the vow of taking the precepts is considered a solemn matter, and it is not uncommon for lay people to undertake only the precepts that they are confident they can keep. The act of taking a vow to keep the precepts is what makes it karmically effective: Spiro found that someone who did not violate the precepts, but did not have any intention to keep them either, was not believed to accrue any religious merit. On the other hand, when people took a vow to keep the precepts, and then broke them afterwards, the negative karma was considered larger as in the case no vow was taken to keep the precepts.\n\nSeveral modern teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh and Sulak Sivaraksa have written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations. In these perspectives, mass production of weapons or spreading untruth through media and education also violate the precepts. On a similar note, human rights organizations in Southeast Asia have attempted to advocate respect for human rights by referring to the five precepts as guiding principles.\n\nThe first precept prohibits the taking of life of a sentient being. It is violated when someone intentionally and successfully kills such a sentient being, having understood it to be sentient and using effort in the process. Causing injury goes against the spirit of the precept, but does, technically speaking, not violate it. The first precept includes taking the lives of animals, even small insects. However, it has also been pointed out that the seriousness of taking life depends on the size, intelligence, benefits done and the spiritual attainments of that living being. Killing a large animal is worse than killing a small animal (also because it costs more effort); killing a spiritually accomplished master is regarded as more severe than the killing of another \"more average\" human being; and killing a human being is more severe than the killing an animal. But all killing is condemned. Virtues that accompany this precept are respect for dignity of life, kindness and compassion, the latter expressed as \"trembling for the welfare of others\". A positive behavior that goes together with this precept is protecting living beings. Positive virtues like sympathy and respect for other living beings in this regard are based on a belief in the cycle of rebirththat all living beings must be born and reborn. The concept of the fundamental Buddha nature of all human beings also underlies the first precept.\n\nThe description of the first precept can be interpreted as a prohibition of capital punishment. Suicide is also seen as part of the prohibition. Moreover, abortion goes against the precept, since in an act of abortion, the criteria for violation are all met. In Buddhism, human life is understood to start at conception. A prohibition of abortion is mentioned explicitly in the monastic precepts, and several Buddhist tales warn of the harmful karmic consequences of abortion. Bioethicist Damien Keown argues that Early Buddhist Texts do not allow for exceptions with regard to abortion, as they consist of a \"consistent' (i.e. exceptionless) pro-life position\". Keown further proposes that that a middle way approach to the five precepts is logically hard to defend. Asian studies scholar Giulo Agostini argues, however, that Buddhist commentators in India from the 4th century onward thought abortion did not break the precepts under certain circumstances.\n\nOrdering another person to kill is also included in this precept, therefore requesting or administering euthanasia can be considered a violation of the precept, as well as advising another person to commit abortion. With regard to euthanasia and assisted suicide, Keown quotes the Pāli \"Dīgha Nikāya\" that says a person upholding the first precept \"does not kill a living being, does not cause a living being to be killed, does not approve of the killing of a living being\". Keown argues that in Buddhist ethics, regardless of motives, death can never be the aim of one's actions.\n\nInterpretations of how Buddhist texts regard warfare are varied, but in general Buddhist doctrine is considered to oppose all warfare. In many \"Jātaka\" tales, such as that of Prince Temiya, as well as some historical documents, the virtue of non-violence is taken as an opposition to all war, both offensive and defensive. At the same time, though, the Buddha is often shown not to explicitly oppose war in his conversations with political figures. Buddhologist André Bareau points out that the Buddha was reserved in his involvement of the details of administrative policy, and concentrated on the moral and spiritual development of his disciples instead. He may have believed such involvement to be futile, or detrimental to Buddhism. Nevertheless, at least one disciple of the Buddha is mentioned in the texts who refrained from retaliating his enemies because of the Buddha, that is King Pasenadi (). The texts are ambiguous in explaining his motives though. In some later Mahāyāna texts, such as in the writings of Asaṅga, examples are mentioned of people who kill those who persecute Buddhists. In these examples, killing is justified by the authors because protecting Buddhism was seen as more important than keeping the precepts. Another example that is often cited is that of King Duṭṭhagāmaṇī, who is mentioned in the post-canonical Pāli Mahāvaṃsa chronicle. In the chronicle, the king is saddened with the loss of life after a war, but comforted by a Buddhist monk, who states that nearly everyone who was killed did not uphold the precepts anyway. Buddhist studies scholar Lambert Schmithausen argues that in many of these cases Buddhist teachings like that of emptiness were misused to further an agenda of war or other violence.\n\nField studies in Cambodia and Burma have shown that many Buddhists considered the first precept the most important, or the most blamable. In some traditional communities, such as in Kandal Province in pre-war Cambodia, as well as Burma in the 1980s, it was uncommon for Buddhists to slaughter animals, to the extent that meat had to be bought from not-Buddhists. In his field studies in Thailand in the 1960s, Terwiel found that villagers did tend to kill insects, but were reluctant and self-conflicted with regard to killing larger animals. In Spiro's field studies, however, Burmese villagers were highly reluctant even to kill insects.\n\nEarly Buddhists did not adopt a vegetarian lifestyle. Indeed, in several Pāli texts vegetarianism is described as irrelevant in the spiritual purification of the mind. There are prohibitions on certain types of meat, however, especially those which are condemned by society. The idea of abstaining from killing animal life has also led to a prohibition on professions that involve trade in flesh or living beings, but not to a full prohibition of all agriculture that involves cattle. In modern times, referring to the law of supply and demand or other principles, some Theravādin Buddhists have attempted to promote vegetarianism as part of the five precepts. For example, the Thai Santi Asoke movement practices vegetarianism.\n\nFurthermore, among some schools of Buddhism, there has been some debate with regard to a principle in the monastic discipline. This principle states that a Buddhist monk cannot accept meat if it comes from animals especially slaughtered for him. Some teachers have interpreted this to mean that when the recipient has no knowledge on whether the animal has been killed for him, he cannot accept the food either. Similarly, there has been debate as to whether laypeople should be vegetarian when adhering to the five precepts. Though vegetarianism among Theravādins is generally uncommon, it has been practiced much in East Asian countries, as some Mahāyāna texts, such as the \"Mahāparanirvana Sūtra\" and the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\", condemn the eating of meat. Nevertheless, even among Mahāyāna Buddhistsand East Asian Buddhiststhere is disagreement on whether vegetarianism should be practiced. In the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\", biological, social and hygienic reasons are given for a vegetarian diet; however, historically, a major factor in the development of a vegetarian lifestyle among Mahāyāna communities may have been that Mahāyāna monastics cultivated their own crops for food, rather than living from alms. Already from the 4th century CE, Chinese writer Xi Chao understood the five precepts to include vegetarianism.\nApart from trade in flesh or living beings, there are also other professions considered undesirable. Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh gives a list of examples, such as working in the arms industry, the military, police, producing or selling poison or drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.\n\nIn general, the first precept has been interpreted by Buddhists as a call for non-violence and pacifism. But there have been some exceptions of people who did not interpret the first precept as an opposition to war. For example, in the twentieth century, some Japanese Zen teachers wrote in support of violence in war, and some of them argued this should be seen as a means to uphold the first precept. There is some debate and controversy surrounding the problem whether a person can commit suicide, such as self-immolation, to reduce other people's suffering in the long run, such as in protest to improve a political situation in a country. Teachers like the Dalai Lama and Shengyan have rejected forms of protest like self-immolation, as well as other acts of self-harming or fasting as forms of protest.\n\nAlthough capital punishment goes against the first precept, as of 2001, many countries in Asia still maintained the death penalty, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Taiwan. In some Buddhist countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, capital punishment was applied during some periods, while during other periods no capital punishment was used at all. In other countries with Buddhism, like China and Taiwan, Buddhism, or any religion for that matter, has had no influence in policy decisions of the government. Countries with Buddhism that have abolished capital punishment include Cambodia and Hong Kong.\n\nIn general, Buddhist traditions oppose abortion. In many countries with Buddhist traditions such as Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, however, abortion is a widespread practice, whether legal or not. Many people in these countries consider abortion immoral, but also think it should be less prohibited. Ethicist Roy W. Perrett, following Ratanakul, argues that this field research data does not so much indicate hypocrisy, but rather points at a \"middle way\" in applying Buddhist doctrine to solve a moral dilemma. Buddhists tend to take \"both sides\" on the pro-lifepro-choice debate, being against the taking of life of a fetus in principle, but also believing in compassion toward mothers. Similar attitudes may explain the Japanese \"mizuko kuyō\" ceremony, a Buddhist memorial service for aborted children, which has led to a debate in Japanese society concerning abortion, and finally brought the Japanese to a consensus that abortion should not be taken lightly, though it should be legalized. This position, held by Japanese Buddhists, takes the middle ground between the Japanese neo-Shinto \"pro-life\" position, and the liberationist, \"pro-choice\" arguments. Keown points out, however, that this compromise does not mean a Buddhist middle way between two extremes, but rather incorporates two opposite perspectives. In Thailand, women who wish to have abortion usually do so in the early stages of pregnancy, because they believe the karmic consequences are less then. Having had abortion, Thai women usually make merits to compensate for the negative karma.\n\nThe second precept prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself (\"what is not given\") and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept. Accompanying virtues are generosity, renunciation, and right livelihood, and a positive behavior is the protection of other people's property.\n\nThe second precept includes different ways of stealing and fraud. Borrowing without permission is sometimes included, as well as gambling. Psychologist Vanchai Ariyabuddhiphongs did studies in the 2000s and 2010s in Thailand and discovered that people who did not adhere to the five precepts more often tended to believe that money was the most important goal in life, and would more often pay bribes than people who did adhere to the precepts. On the other hand, people who observed the five precepts regarded themselves as wealthier and happier than people who did not observe the precepts.\n\nProfessions that are seen to violate the second precept include working in the gambling industry or marketing products that are not actually required for the customer.\n\nThe third precept condemns adultery with women that are \"claimed\" or \"acquired\", or, in other words, it condemns \"going with the wife of another\". The precept also includes women who are engaged with another man, young women that are still \"protected by any relative\", and women who are prostitutes. Moreover, rape and incest are also breaches of this precept. In later texts, details such as intercourse at an inappropriate time or inappropriate place are also counted as breaches of the third precept. Masturbation goes against the spirit of the precept, though in the early texts it is not prohibited for laypeople.\n\nThe third precept is explained as leading to greed in oneself and harm to others. The transgression is regarded as more severe if the other person is a good person. Virtues that go hand-in-hand with the third precept are contentment, especially with one's partner, and recognition and respect for faithfulness in a marriage.\n\nThe third precept is interpreted as avoiding to harm another by using sensuality in the wrong way. This means not engaging with inappropriate partners, but also respecting one's personal commitment to a relationship. In some traditions, the precept also condemns adultery with a woman when her husband agrees with the act, since the nature of the act itself is condemned. Furthermore, flirting with a married woman may also be regarded as a violation. Though prostitution is discouraged in the third precept, it is usually not actively prohibited by Buddhist teachers. With regard to applications of the principles of the third precept, the precept, or any Buddhist principle for that matter, is usually not connected with a stance against contraception. In traditional Buddhist societies such as Sri Lanka, pre-marital sex is considered to violate the precept, though this is not always adhered to by people who already intend to marry.\n\nIn the interpretation of modern teachers, the precept includes any person in a sexual relationship with another person, as they define the precept by terms such as \"sexual responsibility\" and \"long-term commitment\". Some modern teachers include masturbation as a violation of the precept, others include certain professions, such as those that involve sexual exploitation, prostitution or pornography, and professions that promote unhealthy sexual behavior, such as in the entertainment industry.\n\nThe fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action. Avoiding other forms of wrong speech are also considered part of this precept, consisting of malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip. A breach of the precept is considered more serious if the falsehood is motivated by an ulterior motive (rather than, for example, \"a small white lie\"). The accompanying virtue is being honest and dependable, and involves honesty in work, truthfulness to others, loyalty to superiors and gratitude to benefactors. In Buddhist texts, this precept is considered most important next to the first precept, because a lying person is regarded to have no shame, and therefore capable of many wrongs. Untruthfulness is not only to be avoided because it harms others, but also because it goes against the Buddhist ideal of finding the truth.\n\nThe fourth precept includes avoidance of lying and harmful speech. Some modern teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh interpret this to include avoiding spreading false news and uncertain information. Work that involves data manipulation, false advertising or online scams can also be regarded as violations. Terwiel reports that among Thai Buddhists, the fourth precept is also seen to be broken when people insinuate, exaggerate or speak abusively or deceitfully.\n\nThe fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means, and its virtues are mindfulness and responsibility, applied to food, work, behavior, and with regard to the nature of life. Awareness, meditation and heedfulness can also be included here. Medieval Pāli commentator Buddhaghosa writes that whereas violating the first four precepts may be more or less blamable depending on the person or animal affected, the fifth precept is always \"greatly blamable\", as it hinders one from understanding the Buddha's teaching and may lead one to \"madness\". In ancient China, Daoshi described alcohol as the \"doorway to laxity and idleness\" and as a cause of suffering. Nevertheless, he did describe certain cases when drinking was considered less of a problem, such as in the case of a queen distracting the king by alcohol to prevent him from murder. However, Daoshi was generally strict in his interpretations: for example, he allowed medicinal use of alcohol only in extreme cases. Early Chinese translations of the Tripitaka describe negative consequences for people breaking the fifth precept, for themselves and their families. The Chinese translation of the \"Upāsikaśila Sūtra\", as well as the Pāli version of the Sigālovāda Sutta, speak of ill consequences such as loss of wealth, ill health, a bad reputation and \"stupidity\", concluding in a rebirth in hell. The \"Dīrghāgama\" adds to that that alcohol leads to quarreling, negative states of mind and damage to one's intelligence. The Mahāyāna \"Brahmajāla Sūtra\" describes the dangers of alcohol in very strong terms, including the selling of alcohol. Similar arguments against alcohol can be found in Nāgārjuna's writings. The strict interpretation of prohibition of alcohol consumption can be supported by the \"Upāli Sūtra\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s statement that a disciple of the Buddha should not drink any alcohol, \"even a drop on the point of a blade of grass\". However, in the writing of some Abhidharma commentators, consumption was condemned or condoned, depending on the intention with which alcohol was consumed.\n\nAs for the fifth precept, this is regarded as important, because drinking alcohol is condemned for the sluggishness and lack of self-control it leads to, which might lead to breaking the other precepts. In Spiro's field studies, violating the fifth precept was seen as the worst of all the five precepts by half of the monks interviewed, citing the harmful consequences. Nevertheless, in practice it is often disregarded by lay people. In Thailand, drinking alcohol is fairly common, even drunkenness. Among Tibetans, drinking beer is common, though this is only slightly alcoholic. Medicinal use of alcohol is generally not frowned upon, and in some countries like Thailand and Laos, smoking is usually not regarded as a violation of the precept. Thai and Laotian monks have been known to smoke, though monks who have received more training are less likely to smoke. On a similar note, as of 2000, no Buddhist country prohibited the sale or consumption of alcohol, though in Sri Lanka Buddhist revivalists attempted unsuccessfully to get a full prohibition passed in 1956. Moreover, pre-Communist Tibet used to prohibit smoking in some areas of the capital. Monks were prohibited from smoking, and the import of tobacco was banned.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh also includes the aspect of mindful consumption in this precept, which consists of unhealthy food, unhealthy entertainment and unhealthy conversations, among others.\n\nIn modern times, adherence to the precepts among Buddhists is less strict than it traditionally was. This is especially true for the third precept. For example, in Cambodia in the 1990s and 2000s, standards with regard to sexual restraint were greatly relaxed. Some Buddhist movements and communities have tried to go against the modern trend of less strict adherence to the precepts. In Cambodia, a millenarian movement led by Chan Yipon promoted the revival of the five precepts. And in the 2010s, the Supreme Sangha Council in Thailand ran a nationwide program called \"The Villages Practicing the Five Precepts\", aiming to encourage keeping the precepts, with an extensive classification and reward system.\n\nIn many Western Buddhist organizations, the five precepts play a major role in developing ethical guidelines. Furthermore, Buddhist teachers such as Philip Kapleau, Thich Nhat Hanh and Robert Aitken have promoted mindful consumption in the West, based on the five precepts. In another development in the West, some scholars working in the field of mindfulness training have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in such trainings. Specifically, to prevent organizations from using mindfulness training to further an economical agenda with harmful results to its employees, the economy or the environment, the precepts could be used as a standardized ethical framework. As of 2015, several training programs made explicit use of the five precepts as secular, ethical guidelines. However, many mindfulness training specialists consider it problematic to teach the five precepts as part of training programs in secular contexts because of their religious origins and import.\n\nPeace studies scholar Theresa Der-lan Yeh notes that the five precepts address physical, economical, familial and verbal aspects of interaction, and remarks that many conflict prevention programs in schools and communities have integrated the five precepts in their curriculum. On a similar note, peace studies founder Johan Galtung describes the five precepts as the \"basic contribution of Buddhism in the creation of peace\".\n\nStudying lay and monastic ethical practice in traditional Buddhist societies, Spiro argued ethical guidelines such as the five precepts are adhered to as a means to a higher end, that is, a better rebirth or enlightenment. He therefore concluded that Buddhist ethical principles like the five precepts are similar to Western utilitarianism. Keown, however, has argued that the five precepts are regarded as rules that cannot be violated, and therefore may indicate a deontological perspective in Buddhist ethics. On the other hand, he has suggested that Aristoteles' virtue ethics could apply as well, since the precepts are considered good in themselves, and mutually dependent on other aspects of the Buddhist path of practice.\n\nKeown has further argued that the five precepts are very similar to human rights, with regard to subject matter and with regard to their universal nature. Other scholars, as well as Buddhist writers and human rights advocates, have drawn similar comparisons. For example, the following comparisons are drawn:\n\nKeown summarizes the relationship between Buddhist precepts and human rights as \"look[ing] both ways along the juridical relationship, both what one is due to do, and to what is due to one\". On a similar note, Cambodian human rights advocates have argued that for human rights to be fully implemented in society, the strengthening of individual morality must also be addressed. Buddhist monk and scholar Phra Payutto sees the Human Rights Declaration as an unfolding and detailing of the principles that are found in the five precepts, in which a sense of ownership is given to the individual, to make legitimate claims on one's rights. He believes that human rights should be seen as a part of human development, in which one develops from moral discipline (), to concentration () and finally wisdom (). He does not believe, however, that human rights are natural rights, but rather human conventions. Buddhism scholar Somparn Promta disagrees with him. He argues that human beings do have natural rights from a Buddhist perspective, and refers to the \"attūpanāyika-dhamma\", a teaching in which the Buddha prescribes a kind of golden rule of comparing oneself with others. (\"See §Principles, above.\") From this discourse, Promta concludes that the Buddha has laid down the five precepts in order to protect individual rights such as right of life and property: human rights are implicit within the five precepts.

{"id": "48914950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48914950", "title": "Generalized structure tensor", "text": "Generalized structure tensor\n\nIn image analysis, the generalized structure tensor (GST) is an extension of the Cartesian structure tensor to curvilinear coordinates.. It is mainly used to detect and to represent the \"direction\" parameters of curves, just as the Cartesian structure tensor detects and represents the direction in Cartesian coordinates. Curve families generated by pairs of locally orthogonal functions have been the best studied.\n\nIt is a widely known method in applications of image and video processing including computer vision, such as biometric identification by fingerprints, and studies of human tissue sections.\nLet the term image represent a function\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 are real variables and\nformula_3, and formula_4, are real valued functions.\nGST represents the direction along which the image formula_4 can undergo an infinitesimal translation with minimal (total least squares) error, along the \"lines\" fulfilling the following conditions:\n\n1. The \"lines\" are ordinary lines in the curvilinear coordinate basis formula_6\n\nwhich are curves in Cartesian coordinates as depicted by the equation above. The error is measured in the formula_8 sense and the minimality of the error refers thereby to L2 norm.\n\n2. The functions formula_9 constitute a harmonic pair, i.e. they fulfill Cauchy–Riemann equations,\n\nAccordingly, such curvilinear coordinates formula_6 are locally orthogonal.\n\nThen GST consists in \n\nwhere formula_13 are errors of (infinitesimal) translation in the best direction (designated by the angle formula_14) and the worst direction (designated by formula_15). The function formula_16 is the window function defining the \"outer scale\" wherein the detection of formula_17 will be carried out, which can be omitted if it is already included in formula_4 or if formula_4 is the full image (rather than local). The matrix formula_20 is the identity matrix. Using the chain rule, it can be shown that the integration above can be implemented as convolutions in Cartesian coordinates applied to the ordinary structure tensor when formula_6 pair the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function formula_22, \nwhere formula_24 . \nExamples of analytic functions include formula_25, as well as monomials formula_26, formula_27, where formula_28 is an arbitrary positive or negative integer. The monomials formula_29 are also referred to as Harmonic functions in Computer Vision, and Image Processing. \n\nThereby, Cartesian Structure tensor is a special case of GST where formula_30, and formula_31, i.e. the harmonic function is simply formula_32. Thus by choosing a harmonic function formula_33, one can detect all curves that are linear combinations of its real and imaginary parts by convolutions on (rectangular) image grids only, even if formula_6 are non-Cartesian. Furthermore, the convolution computations can be done by using complex filters applied to the complex version of the structure tensor. Thus, GST implementations have frequently been done using complex version of the structure tensor, rather than using the (1,1) tensor.\n\nAs there is a complex version of the ordinary [Structure tensor], there is also a complex version of the GST\nwhich is identical to its cousin with the difference that formula_36 is a complex filter. It should be recalled that, the ordinary structure tensor formula_36 is a real filter, usually defined by a sampled and scaled Gaussian to delineate the neighborhood, also known as the outer scale. This simplicity is a reason for why GST implementations have predominantly used the complex version above. For curve families formula_6 defined by analytic functions formula_33, it can be shown that, the neighborhood defining function is complex valued, \na so called symmetry derivative of a Gaussian. Thus, the orientation wise variation of the pattern to be looked for is directly incorporated into the neighborhood defining function, and the detection occurs in the space of the (ordinary) structure tensor.\n\nEfficient detection of formula_17 in images is possible by image processing for a pair formula_42, formula_43. Complex convolutions (or the corresponding matrix operations) and point-wise non-linear mappings are the basic computational elements of GST implementations. A total least square error estimation of formula_44 is then obtained along with the two errors, formula_45 and formula_46. In analogy with the Cartesian Structure tensor, the estimated angle is in double angle representation, i.e. formula_44 is delivered by computations, and can be used as a shape feature whereas formula_48 alone or in combination with \nformula_49 can be used as a quality (confidence, certainty) measure for the angle estimation.\n\nLogarithmic spirals, including circles, can for instance be detected by (complex) convolutions and non-linear mappings. The spirals can be in gray (valued) images or in a binary image, i.e. locations of edge elements of the concerned patterns, such as contours of circles or spirals, must not be known or marked otherwise.\n\nGeneralized structure tensor can be used as an alternative to Hough transform in image processing and computer vision to detect patterns whose local orientations can be modelled, for example junction points. The main differences comprise:\n\nThe curvilinear coordinates of GST can explain physical processes applied to images. A well known pair of processes consist in rotation, and zooming. These are related to the coordinate transformation formula_50 and formula_51.\n\nIf an image formula_4 consists in iso-curves that can be explained by only $\\xi$ i.e. its iso-curves consist in circles formula_53, where formula_54 is any real valued differentiable function defined on 1D, the image is invariant to rotations (around the origin).\n\nZooming (comprising unzooming) operation is modeled similarly. If the image has iso-curves that look like a \"star\" or bicycle spokes, i.e. formula_55 for some differentable 1D function formula_33 then, the image formula_4 is invariant to scaling (w.r.t. the origin).\n\nIn combination,\n\nformula_58\n\nis invariant to a certain amount of rotation combined with scaling, where the amount is precised by the parameter formula_17.\n\nAnalogously, the Cartesian structure tensor is a representation of a translation too. Here the physical process consists in an ordinary translation of a certain amount along formula_60 combined with translation along formula_61,\n\nwhere the amount is specified by the parameter formula_17. Evidently formula_17 here represents the direction of the line.\n\nGenerally, the estimated formula_17 represents the direction (in formula_6 coordinates) along which infinitisemal translations leave the image invariant, in practice least variant.\nWith every curvilinear coordinate basis pair, there is thus a pair of infinitesimal translators, a linear combination of which is a Differential operator. The latter are related to Lie algebra.\n\n\"Image\" in the context of the GST can mean both an ordinary image and an image neighborhood thereof (local image), depending on context. For example, a photograph is an image as is any neighborhood of it.\n\n"}

Informally speaking, a heap is obtained from a group by \"forgetting\" which element is the unit, in the same way that an affine space can be viewed as a vector space in which the 0 element has been \"forgotten\". A heap is essentially the same thing as a torsor, and the category of heaps is equivalent to the category of torsors, with morphisms given by transport of structure under group homomorphisms, but the theory of heaps emphasizes the intrinsic composition law, rather than global structures such as the geometry of bundles.\n\nFormally, a heap is an algebraic structure consisting of a non-empty set \"H\" with a ternary operation denoted formula_1 that satisfies\n\n\n\nA group can be regarded as a heap under the operation formula_4.

{"id": "13706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13706", "title": "Hero", "text": "Hero\n\nA hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are Medieval and modern heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.\n\nThe concept of the hero can be found in classical literature. It is the main or revered character in heroic epic poetry celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code. The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. Merriam Webster dictionary defines a hero as \"a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities.\" Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as Gilgamesh, Achilles and Iphigenia, to historical figures, such as Joan of Arc or Sophie Scholl, modern heroes like Alvin York, Audie Murphy and Chuck Yeager, and fictional superheroes, including Superman and Batman.\n\nThe word \"hero\" comes from the Greek ἥρως (\"hērōs\"), \"hero\" (literally \"protector\" or \"defender\"), particularly one such as Heracles with divine ancestry or later given divine honors. Before the decipherment of Linear B the original form of the word was assumed to be *, \"hērōw-\", but the Mycenaean compound \"ti-ri-se-ro-e\" demonstrates the absence of -w-.\n\nAccording to the \"American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", the Proto-Indo-European root is \"*ser\" meaning \"to protect\". According to Eric Partridge in \"Origins,\" the Greek word \"Hērōs\" \"is akin to\" the Latin \"seruāre,\" meaning \"to safeguard\". Partridge concludes, \"The basic sense of both Hera and hero would therefore be 'protector'.\" R. S. P. Beekes rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a Pre-Greek origin.\n\nA classical hero is considered to be a \"warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor\" and asserts their greatness by \"the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill\". Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like Achilles, evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances. While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner. During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature. The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from immortal gods to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.\n\nHector was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War, which is known primarily through Homer's \"The Iliad\". Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, \"killing 31,000 Greek fighters,\" offers Hyginus. Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in \"The Iliad,\" as he cannot be both the protector of Troy and a father to his child. Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when Athena appears disguised as his ally Deiphobus and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.Achilles was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of \"The Iliad.\" He was the child of Thetis and Peleus, making him a demi-god. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the Gods. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend Patroclus. Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in \"The Iliad\" brought about by constant de-humanization throughout the epic, having his \"menis\" (wrath) overpower his \"philos\" (love).\n\nHeroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means \"the glory of Hera\", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king Erechtheus, whom Poseidon killed for choosing Athena over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the Acropolis, they invoked him as \"Poseidon Erechtheus\".\n\nFate, or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action. The gods in Greek Mythology, when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the three Fates. The most prominent example of this is found in \"Oedipus Rex.\" After learning that his son, Oedipus, will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, Laius, takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.\n\nStories of heroism may serve as moral examples. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero. For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In classical antiquity, cults that venerated deified heroes such as Heracles, Perseus, and Achilles played an important role in Ancient Greek religion. These ancient Greek hero cults worshipped heroes from oral epic tradition, with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.\n\nThe concept of the \"Mythic Hero Archetype\" was first developed by Lord Raglan in his 1936 book, \"The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama\". It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world. Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.\n\nThe concept of a story archetype of the standard monomythical \"hero's quest\" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes such as Krishna, Buddha, Apollonius of Tyana, and Jesus. One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: \"The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin.\" In his 1968 book, \"The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology\", Campbell writes \"It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved Tammuz, Adonis, and Osiris cycles.\"\n\nVladimir Propp, in his analysis of the Russian fairy tale, concluded that a fairy tale had only eight \"dramatis personæ\", of which one was the hero, and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:\nPropp distinguished between \"seekers\" and \"victim-heroes\". A villain could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.\n\nNo history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of recipients of national medals for bravery, populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes. These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian Cross of Valour (C.V.) \"recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril\"; examples of recipients are Mary Dohey and David Gordon Cheverie.\n\nThe philosopher Hegel gave a central role to the \"hero\", personalized by Napoleon, as the incarnation of a particular culture's \"Volksgeist\", and thus of the general \"Zeitgeist\". Thomas Carlyle's 1841 \"On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History\" also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the biography of a few central individuals such as Oliver Cromwell or Frederick the Great. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.\n\nExplicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the philosophy of history school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, Karl Marx argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in \"class struggles\", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, Herbert Spencer wrote at the end of the 19th century: \"You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown...Before he can remake his society, his society must make him.\" Michel Foucault argued in his analysis of societal communication and debate that history was mainly the \"science of the sovereign\", until its inversion by the \"historical and political popular discourse\".\n\nModern examples of the typical hero are Minnie Vautrin, Norman Bethune, Alan Turing, Raoul Wallenberg, Chiune Sugihara, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Oswaldo Paya, Oscar Biscet, and Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe Annales School, led by Lucien Febvre, Marc Bloch and Fernand Braudel, would contest the exaggeration of the role of individual subjects in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to civilizations, in which geography, economics and demography play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.\n\nAmong noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and Great man in history one should mention Sydney Hook's book (1943) \"The Hero in History\". In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as Judith Fetterley in \"The Resisting Reader\" (1977) and literary theorist Nancy K. Miller, \"The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782\".\n\nIn the epoch of globalization an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.\n\nWithin the frameworks of developing counterfactual history, attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.\n\nIf the term \"heroine\" exists, \"hero\" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.\nActs of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. Women in the military were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.\nIf their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of femininity ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their masculine counterpart.\n\nIf they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time\nlapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and\nemphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.\n\nThe word \"hero\" or \"heroine\", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the protagonist or the love interest of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism. A classic example is Anna Karenina, the lead character in the novel of the same title by Leo Tolstoy. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, William Makepeace Thackeray gave \"Vanity Fair\" the subtitle \"A Novel without a Hero\", and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found. \"Vanity Fair\" is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world. The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.\n\nThe larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of fantasy (particularly in comic-books and epic fantasy) than more realist works. However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The superhero genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a super villain against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Wonder Woman.\n\nSocial psychology has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and Philip Zimbardo point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.\n\nAn evolutionary psychology explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a costly signal demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of altruism for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.\n\nRoma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.\n\nIn the Pulitzer Prize-winning book \"The Denial of Death\", Ernest Becker argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic survival mechanism. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the dilemma of mortality through heroism, by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's \"immortality project\" (or \"\"causa sui\" project\"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality. By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional \"hero-systems\", such as religion, are no longer convincing in the age of reason. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing \"illusions\" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. Terror Management Theory has generated evidence supporting this perspective.\n\n"}

Generalizing the maximum principle for harmonic functions which was already known to Gauss in 1839, Eberhard Hopf proved in 1927 that if a function satisfies a second order partial differential inequality of a certain kind in a domain of R and attains a maximum in the domain then the function is constant. The simple idea behind Hopf's proof, the comparison technique he introduced for this purpose, has led to an enormous range of important applications and generalizations.\n\nLet \"u\" = \"u\"(\"x\"), \"x\" = (\"x\", …, \"x\") be a \"C\" function which satisfies the differential inequality\n\nin an open domain (connected open subset of R) Ω, where the symmetric matrix \"a\" = \"a\"(\"x\") is locally uniformly positive definite in Ω and the coefficients \"a\", \"b\" are locally bounded.

If they are known to be continuous then it is sufficient to demand pointwise positive definiteness of \"a\" on the domain.\n\nIt is usually thought that the Hopf maximum principle applies only to linear differential operators \"L\". In particular, this is the point of view taken by Courant and Hilbert's \"Methoden der mathematischen Physik\". In the later sections of his original paper, however, Hopf considered a more general situation which permits certain nonlinear operators \"L\" and, in some cases, leads to uniqueness statements in the Dirichlet problem for the mean curvature operator and the Monge–Ampère equation.\n\n"}
{"id": "219861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219861", "title": "In-place algorithm", "text": "In-place algorithm\n\nIn computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.\n\nIn-place can have slightly different meanings. In its strictest form, the algorithm can only have a constant amount of extra space, counting everything including function calls and pointers. However, this form is very limited as simply having an index to a length n array requires O(log \"n\") bits. More broadly, in-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though nonconstant extra space for its operation. Usually, this space is O(log \"n\"), though sometimes anything in o(\"n\") is allowed. Note that space complexity also has varied choices in whether or not to count the index lengths as part of the space used. Often, the space complexity is given in terms of the number of indices or pointers needed, ignoring their length. In this article, we refer to total space complexity (DSPACE), counting pointer lengths. Therefore, the space requirements here have an extra log \"n\" factor compared to an analysis that ignores the length of indices and pointers. \n\nAn algorithm may or may not count the output as part of its space usage. Since in-place algorithms usually overwrite their input with output, no additional space is needed. When writing the output to write-only memory or a stream, it may be more appropriate to only consider the working space of the algorithm. In theory applications such as log-space reductions, it is more typical to always ignore output space (in these cases it is more essential that the output is \"write-only\").\n\nGiven an array codice_1 of \"n\" items, suppose we want an array that holds the same elements in reversed order and dispose of the original. One seemingly simple way to do this is to create a new array of equal size, fill it with copies from codice_1 in appropriate order and then delete codice_1.\n\nUnfortunately, this requires O(\"n\") extra space for having the arrays codice_1 and codice_5 available simultaneously. Also, allocation and deallocation are often slow operations. Since we no longer need codice_1, we can instead overwrite it with its own reversal using this in-place algorithm which will only need constant number (2) of integers for the auxiliary variables codice_7 and codice_8, no matter how large the array is.\n\nAs another example, many sorting algorithms rearrange arrays into sorted order in-place, including: bubble sort, comb sort, selection sort, insertion sort, heapsort, and Shell sort. These algorithms require only a few pointers, so their space complexity is .\n\nQuicksort operates in-place on the data to be sorted. However, quicksort requires stack space pointers to keep track of the subarrays in its divide and conquer strategy. Consequently, quicksort needs additional space. Although this non-constant space technically takes quicksort out of the in-place category, quicksort and other algorithms needing only additional pointers are usually considered in-place algorithms.\n\nMost selection algorithms are also in-place, although some considerably rearrange the input array in the process of finding the final, constant-sized result.\n\nSome text manipulation algorithms such as trim and reverse may be done in-place.\n\nIn computational complexity theory, the strict definition of in-place algorithms includes all algorithms with O(1) space complexity, the class DSPACE(1). This class is very limited; it equals the regular languages. In fact, it does not even include any of the examples listed above.\n\nWe usually consider algorithms in L, the class of problems requiring O(log \"n\") additional space, to be in-place. This class is more in line with the practical definition, as it allows numbers of size n as pointers or indices. This expanded definition still excludes quicksort, however, because of its recursive calls. \n\nIdentifying the in-place algorithms with L has some interesting implications; for example, it means that there is a (rather complex) in-place algorithm to determine whether a path exists between two nodes in an undirected graph, a problem that requires O(\"n\") extra space using typical algorithms such as depth-first search (a visited bit for each node). This in turn yields in-place algorithms for problems such as determining if a graph is bipartite or testing whether two graphs have the same number of connected components. See SL for more information.\n\nIn many cases, the space requirements for an algorithm can be drastically cut by using a randomized algorithm. For example, say we wish to know if two vertices in a graph of \"n\" vertices are in the same connected component of the graph. There is no known simple, deterministic, in-place algorithm to determine this, but if we simply start at one vertex and perform a random walk of about 20\"n\" steps, the chance that we will stumble across the other vertex provided that it is in the same component is very high. Similarly, there are simple randomized in-place algorithms for primality testing such as the Miller-Rabin primality test, and there are also simple in-place randomized factoring algorithms such as Pollard's rho algorithm. See RL and BPL for more discussion of this phenomenon.\n\nFunctional programming languages often discourage or don't support explicit in-place algorithms that overwrite data, since this is a type of side effect; instead, they only allow new data to be constructed. However, good functional language compilers will often recognize when an object very similar to an existing one is created and then the old one thrown away, and will optimize this into a simple mutation \"under-the-hood\".\n\nNote that it is possible in principle to carefully construct in-place algorithms that don't modify data (unless the data is no longer being used), but this is rarely done in practice. See purely functional data structures.\n\n"}
{"id": "58792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58792", "title": "Judicial discretion", "text": "Judicial discretion\n\nJudicial discretion is the power of the judiciary to make some legal decisions according to their discretion. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the ability of judges to exercise discretion is an aspect of judicial independence. Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions.\n\nHowever, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by legislation, by binding precedent, or by a constitution, the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the rule of law. In that case, the decision of the court may be \"ultra vires\", and may sometimes be characterized as judicial activism.\n\nIn 1824, US Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the following on this subject:\n\nJudicial power, as contradistinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.\n\nConcerns with regard to recidivism and other law and order issues have led to the introduction of mandatory sentencing. E.g. three-strikes laws and most sex offender registry laws in US are examples of laws carrying severe consequences, and which does not leave room for sentencing judges to consider the actual gravity of the offense, thus significantly limiting judicial discretion in sentencing. Introduction of mandatory minimum in criminal sentencing is often viewed as a shift of judicial power from judges to prosecutors, who are capable of affecting the length of potential sentence through their charging decision, e.g. filing charges on lesser included offense and dropping the charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences. Mandatory sentencing laws have been particularly popular among legislators in the United States. This has provoked formation of non-profit organizations such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums, Women Against Registry and RSOL to lobby for reinstatement of judicial discretion in criminal sentencing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27791233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27791233", "title": "Log-polar coordinates", "text": "Log-polar coordinates\n\nIn mathematics, log-polar coordinates (or logarithmic polar coordinates) is a coordinate system in two dimensions, where a point is identified by two numbers, one for the logarithm of the distance to a certain point, and one for an angle. Log-polar coordinates are closely connected to polar coordinates, which are usually used to describe domains in the plane with some sort of rotational symmetry. In areas like harmonic and complex analysis, the log-polar coordinates are more canonical than polar coordinates.\n\n\"Log-polar coordinates\" in the plane consist of a pair of real numbers (ρ,θ), where ρ is the logarithm of the distance between a given point and the origin and θ is the angle between a line of reference (the \"x\"-axis) and the line through the origin and the point. The angular coordinate is the same as for polar coordinates, while the radial coordinate is transformed according to the rule\n\nwhere formula_2 is the distance to the origin. The formulas for transformation from Cartesian coordinates to log-polar coordinates are given by\n\nand the formulas for transformation from log-polar to Cartesian coordinates are\n\nBy using complex numbers (\"x\", \"y\") = \"x\" + \"iy\", the latter transformation can be written as\n\ni.e. the complex exponential function. From this follows that basic equations in harmonic and complex analysis will have the same simple form as in Cartesian coordinates. This is not the case for polar coordinates.\n\nLaplace's equation in two dimensions is given by\n\nin Cartesian coordinates. Writing the same equation in polar coordinates gives the more complicated equation\n\nor equivalently\n\nHowever, from the relation formula_9 it follows that formula_10 so Laplace's equation in log-polar coordinates,\n\nhas the same simple expression as in Cartesian coordinates. This is true for all coordinate systems where the transformation to Cartesian coordinates is given by a conformal mapping. Thus, when considering Laplace's equation for a part of the plane with rotational symmetry, e.g. a circular disk, log-polar coordinates is the natural choice.\n\nA similar situation arises when considering analytical functions. An analytical function formula_12 written in Cartesian coordinates satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations:\n\nIf the function instead is expressed in polar form formula_14, the Cauchy–Riemann equations take the more complicated form\n\nJust as in the case with Laplace's equation, the simple form of Cartesian coordinates is recovered by changing polar into log-polar coordinates (let formula_16):\n\nThe Cauchy–Riemann equations can also be written in one single equation as\n\nBy expressing formula_19 and formula_20 in terms of formula_21 and formula_22 this equation can be written in the equivalent form\n\nWhen one wants to solve the Dirichlet problem in a domain with rotational symmetry, the usual thing to do is to use the method of separation of variables for partial differential equations for Laplace's equation in polar form. This means that you write formula_24. Laplace's equation is then separated into two ordinary differential equations\n\nwhere formula_26 is a constant. The first of these has constant coefficients and is easily solved. The second is a special case of Euler's equation\n\nwhere formula_28 are constants. This equation is usually solved by the ansatz formula_29, but through use of log-polar radius, it can be changed into an equation with constant coefficients:\n\nWhen considering Laplace's equation, formula_31 and formula_32 so the equation for formula_2 takes the simple form\n\nWhen solving the Dirichlet problem in Cartesian coordinates, these are exactly the equations for \nformula_35 and formula_36. Thus, once again the natural choice for a domain with rotational symmetry is not polar, but rather log-polar, coordinates.\n\nIn order to solve a PDE numerically in a domain, a discrete coordinate system must be introduced in this domain. If the domain has rotational symmetry and you want a grid consisting of rectangles, polar coordinates are a poor choice, since in the center of the circle it gives rise to triangles rather than rectangles. However, this can be remedied by introducing log-polar coordinates in the following way. Divide the plane into a grid of squares with side length 2formula_37/\"n\", where \"n\" is a positive integer. Use the complex exponential function to create a log-polar grid in the plane. The left half-plane is then mapped onto the unit disc, with the number of radii equal to \"n\". It can be even more advantageous to instead map the diagonals in these squares, which gives a discrete coordinate system in the unit disc consisting of spirals, see the figure to the right.\n\nThe latter coordinate system is for instance suitable for dealing with Dirichlet and Neumann problems. If the discrete coordinate system is interpreted as an undirected graph in the unit disc, it can be considered as a model for an electrical network. To every line segment in the graph is associated a conductance given by a function formula_38. The electrical network will then serve as a discrete model for the Dirichlet problem in the unit disc, where the Laplace equation takes the form of Kirchhoff's law. On the nodes on the boundary of the circle, an electrical potential (Dirichlet data) is defined, which induces an electric current (Neumann data) through the boundary nodes. The linear operator formula_39 from Dirichlet data to Neumann data is called a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, and depends on the topology and conductance of the network.\n\nIn the case with the continuous disc, it follows that if the conductance is homogeneous, let's say formula_40 everywhere, then the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator satisfies the following equation\n\nIn order to get a good discrete model of the Dirichlet problem, it would be useful to find a graph in the unit disc whose (discrete) Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator has the same property. Even though polar coordinates don't give us any answer, this is approximate/assymptoticaly, what the rotationally symmetric network given by log-polar coordinates provides us with.\n\nAlready at the end of the 1970s, applications for the discrete spiral coordinate system were given in image analysis. To represent an image in this coordinate system rather than in Cartesian coordinates, gives computational advantages when rotating or zooming in an image. Also, the photo receptors in the retina in the human eye are distributed in a way that has big similarities with the spiral coordinate system. It can also be found in the Mandelbrot fractal (see picture to the right).\n\nLog-polar coordinates can also be used to construct fast methods for the Radon transform and its inverse. \n\n"}

Shahu Maharaj, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ramaswami Naicker, B.R. Ambedkar, M.N. Roy, Goparaju Ramachandra Rao ‘Gora’ and Sahodaran Ayyappan moulded the rationalist mode of thinking in India in the 20th century. Among the first rationalist organisations in India were Rationalist Association of India which was set up in 1930, and Yukthivadi Sangham which was registered in 1935. The Atheist Centre launched by Mahatma Gandhi's follower Goparaju Ramachandra Rao \"Gora\" in Andhra Pradesh in 1940, and the Indian Rationalist Association (IRA) set up in Chennai with R.P. Paranjpye as founding president were among the other important organisations in the Indian rationalist movement. Maharashtra Rationalist Association was one of the first rationalist organisations in Maharashtra. \n\nIt was headed by noted personalities like Justice Raghavendra A. Jahagirdar, a retired judge of the Bombay High Court who passed several landmark judgments. Yahya A. Lokhandwala, who also served as the president of Indian Rationalist Association, and Dr. Rajeev Joshi were other prominent leaders of Maharashtra Rationalist Association. Lokhandwala wrote about rationalist activities in India in international publications like American Atheist Magazine. \n\nMaharashtra Rationalist Association was the fulcrum of organised rationalism in the state. It played a pivotal role in mobilising support for irreligion in India well into the 1980s. Activists of Maharashtra Rationalist Association and two other organisations demonstrated on Tuesday, 12 May 1981 against self-styled godman Sathya Sai Baba and against the participation of O.P. Mehra, the Governor of the secular state of Maharashtra, in a religious function at Dharmakshetra, Mumbai. They shouted slogans such as \"Sai Baba is a trickster!\" The activists were arrested and taken to police station. The next day, the Governor invited Lokhandwala to his official residence and expressed regret for the arrest and the misbehaviour of his staff. The event received wide publicity in the media and cemented Maharashtra Rationalist Association's position as a formidable force in the renaissance movement in Maharashtra. \n\nBombay Rationalist Association (BRA), which worked among the Malayali emigrants in Mumbai, merged into Maharashtra Rationalist Association. The Association was very active during the period before the rationalist movement split into several organisations like All India Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti and, very recently, \"We, the Brights.\" Maharashtra Rationalist Association became inactive over time for unspecified reasons. \n\nMaharashtra Rationalist Association is the predecessor of Mumbai Rationalist Association (MRA).\n\n"}

{"id": "548500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=548500", "title": "Mau movement", "text": "Mau movement\n\nThe Mau was a non-violent movement for Samoan independence from colonial rule during the first half of the 20th century. \"Mau\" means 'opinion,' 'unwavering,' 'to be decided,' or 'testimony' denoting 'firm strength' in Samoan. The motto for the Mau were the words Samoa mo Samoa (Samoa for the Samoans). Similarly in Hawaii'an \"Mau\" means to strive or persevere, and is often linked with Hawaii'an poetry relating to independence and sovereignty struggles.\n\nThe movement had its beginnings on the island of Savai'i with the \"Mau a Pule\" resistance in the early 1900s with widespread support throughout the country by the late 1920s. As the movement grew, leadership came under the country's chiefly elite, the customary \"matai\" leaders entrenched in Samoan tradition and fa'a Samoa. The Mau included women who supported the national organisation through leadership and organisation as well as taking part in marches. Supporters wore a Mau uniform of a navy blue lavalava with a white stripe which was later banned by the colonial administration.\n\nThe Mau movement culminated on 28 December 1929 in the streets of the capital Apia, when the New Zealand military police fired on a procession who were attempting to prevent the arrest of one of their members. The day became known as Black Saturday. Up to 11 Samoans were killed, including Mau leader and high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III with many others wounded. One New Zealand constable was clubbed to death by protesters.\nThe Mau movement's efforts would ultimately result in the political independence of Samoa in 1962 but the height of the movement's activity in the Western Islands occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nBroadly, the history of the Mau movement can be seen as beginning in the 19th century with European contact and the advent of Western powers, Britain, United States and Germany, vying for control of the Pacific nation. The country became German Samoa (1900–1914) followed by New Zealand colonial rule during which the Mau gathered national support. \n\nA key event occurred in 1908, in a dispute between the German colonial administration and the \"Malo o Samoa\", or Samoan Council of Chiefs, over the establishment of a copra business owned and controlled by native Samoans.\n\nThe dispute led to the eventual formation of a resistance movement called \"Mau a Pule\" on Savai'i by Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe, one of the Samoan leaders from Safotulafai who was deposed by the German Governor of Samoa, Wilhelm Solf. As well as deposing members of the \"Malo o Samoa\", Solf called in two German warships as a show of strength. Lauaki returned with his warriors from Savai'i for battle. The German governor convinced Mata'afa to set up a \"peace talk meeting\" with Lauaki but that Lauaki had to disperse his army before the meeting. Unbeknown to Mata'afa was the intent of the German governor to rid of Lauaki. Lauaki, a man of honor, returned with his warriors to Savai'i as they were reluctant to leave Upolu without him. After ensuring his warriors' arrival to their villages, Lauaki returned to Upolu. As it took Lauaki several days to disperse his army, the German governor set up his trap. Days later upon their return to Upolu, Lauaki and some of the Chiefs were betrayed at this \"peace talk\", held aboard the German ship. In 1909, Lauaki and the other senior leaders of the \"Mau a Pule\" were exiled to the German colonies in the Marianas (North West Pacific) where they were to stay until 1914, when New Zealand took over Samoa as part of its Empire duties at the outbreak of World War I. Many of those exiled died before returning to Samoa. Lauaki died en route back to Samoa in 1915.\n\nThe Samoan independence movement would not gain strength again until after New Zealand forces, unopposed by the German rulers, annexed Western Samoa in 1914, at the beginning of World War I. Military rule continued after the war ended, and in 1919, some 7,500 Samoans, around 22 per cent of the population, died during an influenza epidemic. It was already known that Samoans were susceptible to the smallest European diseases, as they had never encountered them before. When the ship \"SS Talune\" arrived in Apia with its crew and passengers obviously sick with influenza, they were allowed to dock by the New Zealanders.\n\nTwo days later the first deaths were reported. No attempt was made by the New Zealand administrators to quell or contain the spread, and after one week it had spread through the whole of Samoa. Whole families were killed, with such alarming speed that corpses lay around for weeks without being buried. They were either thrown in mass graves or left in houses which were torched. However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the current situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Logan who was in charge; Logan was British born and hated Americans. He destroyed the telegram and cut off any other contact to American Samoa. The Americans had a large medical team who could have saved many lives.\nThis catastrophic event was to lay a new foundation for discontent with an administration already perceived as incompetent and dishonest by many Samoans. The clumsy handling of Samoa's governance, the slow and deliberate erosion of traditional Samoan social structures by successive administrators, and a general failure to understand and respect Samoan culture also sowed the seeds for a revitalised resistance to colonial rule. Logan was replaced by Colonel Robert Tate.\n\nThe groundswell of support among Samoans for the Mau came from the leadership of Samoan \"matai\", the heads of families in Samoa's traditional socio-political structure. Family and chiefly title connections, a central part of Samoan culture, were used to harness support. The success of the Mau in gathering national support showed that \"fa'a Samoa\" was still strong despite colonialism.\n\nSamoans of mixed parentage, facing discrimination from both cultures but with the advantage of cross-cultural knowledge, also played a key role in the new movement.\n\nOlaf Frederick Nelson, one of the leaders of the new Mau movement, was a successful merchant of mixed Swedish and Samoan heritage. Nelson was the richest man in Samoa at the time and well-travelled. He was frustrated by the colonial administration's exclusion of native and part-Samoans from governance. Notably, he was one of many who had lost a child to the influenza epidemic of 1919 in addition to his mother, sister, only brother, and sister in-law. Although classified as a European, he considered himself Samoan \"by birth blood and sentiment.\"\n\nIn 1926, Nelson visited Wellington to lobby the New Zealand government on the issue of increased self-rule. During his visit, the Minister for External Affairs, William Nosworthy, promised to visit Samoa to investigate. When Nosworthy postponed his trip, Nelson organised two public meetings in Apia, which were attended by hundreds, and The Samoan League, or \"O le Mau\", was formed.\n\nThe Mau published the \"Samoa Guardian\" newspaper as a mouthpiece for the movement. To demonstrate the extent of popular support for the Mau, Nelson organised a sports meeting for movement members on the King's Birthday, in parallel with the official event, and held a well-attended ball at his home on the same night. Movement members had begun to engage in acts of noncooperation: neglecting the compulsory weekly search for the rhinoceros beetle, enemy of the coconut palm, thereby threatening the lucrative copra industry. When New Zealand administrators imposed a per-capita beetle quota, many Samoan villages resisted by breeding the insects in tightly-woven baskets rather than comply with the orders to scour the forests and collect them.\n\nIn 1927, alarmed at the growing strength of the Mau, George Richardson, the administrator of Samoa, changed the law to allow the deportation of Europeans or part-Europeans charged with fomenting unrest. This action was presumably taken on the assumption that the growing movement was merely a product of self-interested Europeans agitating the native Samoans.\n\nIn reality, however, the Mau was built upon the traditional forms of Samoan political organisation. In each village that joined the movement, a committee was formed, consisting of the chiefs and \"talking men\". These committees formed the basic element of an alternative system of governance, and the tendency of Samoans to unite under traditional leadership meant that by the mid- to late 1920s, around 85% of the Samoan population was involved in open resistance.\n\nFollowing another visit to New Zealand to petition the Government, Nelson was exiled from Samoa along with two other part-European Mau leaders. The petition, which led to the formation of a joint select committee to investigate the situation in Samoa, quoted an ancient Samoan proverb: \"We are moved by love, but never driven by intimidation.\"\n\nThe Mau remained true to this sentiment, and despite the exile of Nelson, continued to use civil disobedience to oppose the New Zealand administration. They boycotted imported products, refused to pay taxes and formed their own \"police force\", picketing stores in Apia to prevent the payment of customs to the authorities. Village committees established by the administration ceased to meet and government officials were ignored when they went on tour. Births and deaths went unregistered. Coconuts went unharvested, and the banana plantations were neglected.\n\nAs the select committee was forced to admit, \"a very substantial proportion of Samoans had joined the Mau, a number quite sufficient, if they determined to resist and thwart the activities of the Administration, to paralyse the functions of government.\"\n\nRichardson sent a warship and a 70-strong force of marines to quell the largely non-violent resistance. 400 Mau members were arrested, but others responded by giving themselves up in such numbers that there were insufficient jail cells to detain them all, and the prisoners came and went as they pleased. One group of prisoners found themselves in a three-sided \"cell\" which faced the ocean, and were able to swim away to tend to their gardens and visit their families.\n\nWith his attempt at repression turning to ridicule, Richardson offered pardons to all those arrested; however, arrestees demanded to be dealt with by the court, and then refused to enter pleas to demonstrate their rejection of the court's jurisdiction.\n\nThe new administrator, Stephen Allen, replaced the marines with a special force of New Zealand police, and began to target the leaders of the movement.\n\nTupua Tamasese Lealofi III, who had led the movement following the exile of Nelson, was arrested for non-payment of taxes and imprisoned for six months.\n\nOn 28 December 1929 — which would be known thereafter as \"Black Saturday\" — New Zealand military police fired upon a peaceful demonstration which had assembled to welcome home A.G. Smyth, a European movement leader returning to Samoa after a two-year exile. Reports of the massacre are sketchy because the official cover-up for the incident was so effective. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III had rushed to the front of the crowd and turned to face his people; he called for peace from them because some were throwing stones at the police. With his back to the police calling for peace he was shot in the back; another Samoan who rushed to help him was shot in both legs while cradling his head. Another who had attempted to shield his body from the bullets was shot. Two more rushing to help were killed before they could reach him. \n\nShooting stopped at around 6.30 am. Eight had died, three would later die, and about 50 were wounded. One policeman had also been clubbed to death.\n\nAmong the wounded were terrified women and children who had fled to a market place for cover from New Zealand police firing from the verandah of the station, one of them wielding a Lewis machine-gun.\n\nAs he lay dying, Tamesese III made this statement to his followers:\n\nMy blood has been spilt for Samoa. I am proud to give it. Do not dream of avenging it, as it was spilt in peace. If I die, peace must be maintained at any price.\n\nFollowing the massacre, male Mau members fled to the mountains, the traditional retreat of those defeated in war. The resistance continued by other means, with the emergence of a women's Mau to continue the councils, parades and symbolic protests that the men now could not. For the women's movement, even the game of cricket represented an act of defiance inviting official harassment.\n\nThe day after his funeral, his village was raided by New Zealand military police; they ransacked houses, including those of the Tamasese's mourning widow and children. Colonel Allen requested reinforcements from New Zealand after he claimed 2000 Mau had caused a riot. On 12 January 1930 the Royal New Zealand Navy flagship \"Dunedin\" brought marines to hunt down members of The Mau. The Mau, who were fully committed to Passive Resistance, easily slipped through the jungle; the marines were slow because they were carrying too much weaponry and didn't know the bush like The Mau. The Mau no longer trusted New Zealand police, and this fear only got worse after a 16-year-old un-armed Samoan was shot and killed while running away from a marine, whose excuse he thought the boy was going to throw a stone was accepted as an adequate defence and no charges were laid.\n\nA truce was declared on 12 March 1930, after another child was killed by New Zealand marines who were now suffering heat exhaustion and tropical infections. The male Mau members returned to their homes, on the condition that they retain their right to engage in non-cooperation. Meanwhile, Nelson and other exiled leaders continued to lobby the New Zealand Government and communicate their progress to the Mau. In 1931, news of the growing resistance to the British rule of India reached many Samoan villages.\n\nThe Mau movement had not gone unnoticed by the population of New Zealand, and the treatment of Samoans at the hands of the administration had become a contentious issue in some New Zealand electorates during the 1929 election. 1936 marked a turning point for Samoa, with the election of a Labour Government in New Zealand and the subsequent relaxation of repression by the Samoan administration. Under the new Government, there was slow movement towards greater involvement of Samoans in the administration of their own country.\n\nWhen Western Samoa gained its independence in 1962, Tupua Tamasese Meaole, son of the Mau movement leader, became its first co-head of state with Malietoa Tanumafili II.\n\nFiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II (1921–1975), the son of another high chief and Mau leader Mata'afa Faumuina Fiame Mulinu'u I, became the first Prime Minister of Samoa.\n\nIn July 1997, the Samoa Constitution was amended to change the country's name to Samoa, and officially the Independent State of Samoa.\n\nIn 2002, Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand made an unprecedented move and apologised to Samoa for New Zealand's treatment of Samoans during the colonial era. Clark made the apology in the capital Apia during the 40th anniversary of Samoa's independence. The apology covered the influenza epidemic of 1918, the shooting of unarmed Mau protesters by New Zealand police in 1929 and the banishing of matai (chiefs) from their homes.\n\nThe Mau had manifestations in both the Western and Eastern Samoan island groups.\nThe Mau movement emerged as an articulated of an indigenous response to the U.S. annexation of the eastern Samoan islands in 1899. It featured the signing of petitions in efforts to enact political transformation vis-a-vis American colonial government, and included effort to resist taxation of copra.\n\nThere was an American Samoa Mau that took place in Tutuila in American Samoa in the 1920s. It emerged as a result of fluctuating prices of copra and represented an open affront to the American Navy and its patterns of treatment of the indigenous Samoan people and failure to respect Samoan customs, conceptions of self-government and the Samoan way of life.\nThis movement received a lot of press in the United States, both favourable and unfavourable. The leader of the movement, Samuel Ripley of Leone, Tutuila, was in effect exiled from American Samoa, when he was barred by the US Navy authorities from disembarking from a ship returning to Pagopago from California, and he was never allowed to return to his homeland. He eventually became the mayor of Richmond, California. The United States sent a committee to American Samoa in 1930, including US citizens from Hawaii who had a prominent role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom and Queen Lili'uokalani. Their report, favourable to the US position, had a considerable influence on US policy, and the American Samoa Mau was totally suppressed by the US. Its influence however continued to be felt.\n\nA Samoan hip hop group that was founded in 1990 by Kosmo, MC Kha Tha Feelstyle Orator and DJ Rockit V. The Mau was named for the Mau movement. The motto of the group became the same as the motto of the Mau movement; Samoa Mo Samoa, or Samoa for Samoans. The Mau has now reformed as the group Rough Opinion. The group still carries the message of the Mau movement as their theme.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "620299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620299", "title": "Négritude", "text": "Négritude\n\nNégritude is a framework of critique and literary theory, developed mainly by francophone intellectuals, writers, and politicians of the African diaspora during the 1930s. Its initiators included Martinican poet Aimé Césaire, Léopold Sédar Senghor (the first President of Senegal), and Léon Damas of French Guiana. \"Négritude\" intellectuals disavowed colonialism, and argued for the importance of a Pan-African racial identity among people of African descent worldwide. The intellectuals employed Marxist political philosophy, in the black radical tradition. The writers generally used a realist literary style, and some say they were also influenced somewhat by the Surrealist stylistics. In 1932, the manifesto \"Murderous Humanitarianism\" was signed by prominent Surrealists, including the Martinicans Pierre Yoyotte and J. M. Monnerot.\n\n' is a constructed noun from the 1930s based upon the French word \"nègre\", which, as its English counterpart was derogatory and had a different meaning from \"black man\". The movement's use of the word négritude is a way of re-imagining the word as an emic form of empowerment. The term was first used in its present sense by Césaire, in the third issue of \"L'Étudiant noir\", a magazine which he had started in Paris with fellow students Léopold Senghor and Léon Damas, as well as Gilbert Gratiant, Leonard Sainville, Louis T. Achille, Aristide Maugée, and Paulette Nardal. \"L'Étudiant noir\" also includes Césaire's first published work, \"Conscience Raciale et Révolution Sociale\" with the heading \"Les Idées\" and the rubric \"Négreries\", which is notable for its disavowal of assimilation as a valid strategy for resistance and for its use of the word ' as a positive term. The problem with assimilation was that one assimilated into a culture that considered African culture to be barbaric and unworthy of being seen as \"civilized\". The assimilation into this culture would have been seen as an implicit acceptance of this view. \"Nègre\" previously had been used mainly in a pejorative sense. Césaire deliberately incorporated this derogatory word into the name of his philosophy.\n\nIn 1885, Haitian anthropologist Anténor Firmin published an early work \"De l'Égalité des Races Humaines\" (On the Equality of Human Races), which was published as a rebuttal to French writer Count Arthur de Gobineau's \"Essai sur l'inegalite des Races Humaines\" (\"An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\"). Firmin influenced Jean Price-Mars, the initiator of Haitian ethnology and developer of the concept of Indigenism, and 20th-century American anthropologist Melville Herskovits. Black intellectuals have historically been proud of Haiti due to its slave revolution commanded by Toussaint L'Ouverture during the 1790s. Césaire spoke, thus, of Haiti as being \"where négritude stood up for the first time\".\n\nOther diverse thinkers include Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, René Maran, and Arthur Rimbaud. \n\nThe Harlem Renaissance, a literary style developed in Harlem in Manhattan during the 1920s and 1930s, influenced the Negritude philosophy. The Harlem Renaissance's writers, including Langston Hughes and Richard Wright, addressed the themes of \"noireism\" and race relations.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, young black students and scholars, primarily from France's colonies and territories, assembled in Paris, where they were introduced to writers of the Harlem Renaissance by Paulette Nardal and her sister Jane. The Nardal sisters contributed to the Negritude discussions in their writings and also owned the Clamart Salon, a tea-shop venue of the French-Black intelligentsia where Negritude philosophy was often discussed. Paulette Nardal and the Haitian Dr. Leo Sajou initiated \"La revue du Monde Noir\" (1931–32), a literary journal published in English and French, which attempted to appeal to African and Caribbean intellectuals in Paris. This Harlem association was shared by the parallel development of \"negrismo\" in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean region.\n\nAlthough each of the initiators had his own ideas about the purpose and styles of la Négritude, the philosophy was characterized generally by opposition to colonialism, denunciation of Europe's alleged inhumanity, and rejection of Western domination and ideas. The movement also appears to have had some Heideggerian strands in the sense that its goal was to achieve blacks' \"being-in-the-world\", to emphasize that blacks did have a history and a worthy culture capable of standing alongside the cultures of other countries as equals. Also important was the acceptance of and pride in being black and a celebration of African history, traditions, and beliefs. Their literary style was realistic and they cherished Marxist ideas.\n\nMotivation for the Negritude movement was a result of Aimé Césaire’s, Leopold Senghor’s, and Leon Damas’s dissatisfaction, disgust, and personal conflict over the state of black French experience in France. All three shared a personal sense of revolt for the racism and colonial injustices that plagued their world and their French education. Senghor refused to believe that the purpose of his education was \"to build Christianity and civilization in his soul where there was only paganism and barbarism before\". Césaire's disgust came as embarrassment when he was accused by some of the people of the Caribbean as having nothing to do with the people of Africa—whom they saw as savages. They separated themselves from Africa and proclaimed themselves as civilized. He denounced the writers from the Caribbean as \"intellectually... corrupt and literarily nourished with white decadence\". Damas believed this because of the pride these writers would take when a white person could read their whole book and not be able to tell the author's complexion.\n\nCésaire was a poet, playwright, and politician from Martinique. He studied in Paris, where he discovered the black community and \"rediscovered Africa\". He saw la Négritude as the fact of being black, acceptance of this fact, and appreciation of the history and culture, and of black people. It is important to note that for Césaire, this emphasis on the acceptance of the fact of \"blackness\" was the means by which the \"decolonization of the mind\" could be achieved. According to him, western imperialism was responsible for the inferiority complex of blacks. He sought to recognize the collective colonial experience of Blacks—the slave trade and plantation system. Césaire's ideology was especially important during the early years of la Négritude.\n\nNeither Césaire—who after returning to Martinique after his studies was elected mayor of Fort de France, the capital, and a representative of Martinique in France's Parliament—nor Senghor in Senegal envisaged political independence from France. Négritude would, according to Senghor, enable Blacks in French lands to have a \"seat at the give and take [French] table as equals\". However the French eventually presented Senegal and its other African colonies with independence.\n\nPoet and the later first president of Sénégal, Senghor used la Négritude to work toward a universal valuation of African people. He advocated a modern incorporation of the expression and celebration of traditional African customs and ideas. This interpretation of la Négritude tended to be the most common, particularly during later years.\n\nDamas was a French Guianese poet and National Assembly member. He had a militant style of defending \"black qualities\" and rejected any kind of reconciliation with caucasians. Two particular anthologies were pivotal to the movement, which would serve as manifestos for the movement. One was published by Damas in 1946, Poètes d'expression française 1900–1945. Senghor would then go on to publish \"Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française\" in 1948. Damas’s introduction to the anthology and the anthology was meant to be a sort of manifesto for the movement, but Senghor's own anthology eventually took that role. Though it would be the “Preface” written by French philosopher and public intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre for the anthology which would propel Negritude into the broader intellectual conversation.\n\nAs a manifesto for the Negritude movement Damas’ introduction was more political and cultural in nature. A distinctive feature of Damas’s anthology and beliefs was that Damas felt that his message was one for the colonized in general, and included poets from Indochina and Madagascar. This is sharply in contrast to Senghor’s anthology which would be published two years later. In the introduction Damas proclaimed that now was the age where \"the colonized man becomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a novelist or a storyteller, an essayist or a poet.\" Damas explicitly outlines the themes of the anthology. He says, \"Poverty, illiteracy, exploitation of man by man, social and political racism suffered by the black or the yellow, forced labor, inequalities, lies, resignation, swindles, prejudices, complacencies, cowardice, failure, crimes committed in the name of liberty, of equality, of fraternity, that is the theme of this indigenous poetry in French.\" Damas’ introduction was indeed a calling and affirmation for a distinct cultural identification.\n\nIn 1948, Jean-Paul Sartre analyzed the \"négritude\" philosophy in an essay called \"Orphée Noir\" (\"Black Orpheus\") that served as the introduction to a volume of francophone poetry named \"Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache\", compiled by Léopold Senghor. In this essay, Sartre characterizes \"négritude\" as the opposite of colonial racism in a Hegelian dialectic and with it he helped to introduce Négritude issues to French intellectuals. In his opinion, \"négritude\" was an \"anti-racist racism\" (\"racisme antiraciste\"), a strategy with a final goal of racial unity.\n\nNégritude was criticized by some black writers during the 1960s as insufficiently militant. Keorapetse Kgositsile said that the term Négritude was based too much on blackness according to a caucasian aesthetic, and was unable to define a new kind of perception of African-ness that would free black people and black art from caucasian conceptualizations altogether.\n\nThe Nigerian dramatist, poet, and novelist Wole Soyinka opposed Négritude. He believed that by deliberately and outspokenly being proud of their ethnicity, black people were automatically on the defensive. According to some, he said: \"Un tigre ne proclame pas sa tigritude, il saute sur sa proie\" (French: A tiger doesn't proclaim its tigerness; it jumps on its prey). But in fact, Soyinka wrote in a 1960 essay for the \"Horn\", “the duiker will not paint ‘duiker’ on his beautiful back to proclaim his duikeritude; you’ll know him by his elegant leap.” \n\nAfter a long period of silence there has been a renaissance of Negritude developed by scholars such as Souleymane Bachir Diagne (Columbia), Donna Jones (Berkeley), and Cheikh Thiam (Ohio State) who all continue the work of Abiola Irele. Cheikh Thiam's book is the only book-length study of Negritude as philosophy. It develops Diagne's reading of Negritude as a philosophy of art, and Jones' presentation of Negritude as a lebensphilosophie.\n\nAmerican physician Benjamin Rush, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence and early abolitionist, used the term \"negritude\" to imagine a rhetorical \"disease\" which he said was a mild form of leprosy, the only cure of which was to become white. This early use of the term may not have been known by the Francophone blacks who developed the philosophy of Negritude during the 20th century.\n\nNovelist Norman Mailer used the term to describe boxer George Foreman's physical and psychological presence in his book \"The Fight\", a journalistic treatment of the legendary Ali vs. Foreman \"Rumble in the Jungle\" bout in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in October 1974.\n\n\n\nOriginal texts\n\nSecondary literature\n\n\n"}

Early references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek texts.\n\nThe idea of one person being able to consciously travel or interact within the dream of another person, known variously as \"dream telepathy\", \"telepathic lucid dreaming\" or \"telepathic dreaming\", has been explored in the realms of science and fantasy fiction; in recent works, such an interaction is often depicted as a computer-mediated psychotherapeutic action, as is the case in \"The Cell\", and \"Paprika\", as well as through the direct intervention of another sleeping person, as in \"Inception\", \"Dreamscape\" and \"Waking Life\". The concept is also included in the fantasy series \"The Wheel of Time\" as an ability \"dreamwalkers\" are able to use.\n\nA trope in such works of fiction explores the ramifications of whether the sleeping protagonist should enter the sleeping brain of another as opposed to allowing another individual to enter one's own brain; the entering of another individual's brain often results in unpleasant surprises, depending upon the mental state of the host or the preparedness of the guest. Roger Zelazny's 1966 sci-fi novella \"The Dream Master\", which applies computer-mediated dream telepathy in a psychotherapeutic setting, focuses on the protagonist's growing struggle to keep his balance as he enters the brain of a fellow psychotherapist who is blind and subconsciously, destructively hungers for the visual stimuli upon which dreams largely depend.\n\n"}
{"id": "22261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22261", "title": "Ontology", "text": "Ontology\n\nOntology is the philosophical study of being. More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular becoming, existence, reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.\n\nThe compound word \"ontology\" (\"study of being\") combines \"onto-\" (Gr. ὄν, \"on\", gen. ὄντος, \"ontos\", \"being; that which is\") and \"-logia\" (Gr. -λογία, \"logical discourse\"). See classical compounds for this type of word formation.\n\nWhile the etymology is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the New Latin form \"ontologia\", appeared in 1606 in the work \"Ogdoas Scholastica\" by Jacob Lorhard (\"Lorhardus\") and in 1613 in the \"Lexicon philosophicum\" by Rudolf Göckel (\"Goclenius\").\n\nThe first occurrence in English of \"ontology\" as recorded by the \"OED\" (\"Oxford English Dictionary\", online edition, 2008) came in a work by Gideon Harvey (1636/7–1702): \"Archelogia philosophica nova; or, New principles of Philosophy. Containing Philosophy in general, Metaphysicks or Ontology, Dynamilogy or a Discourse of Power, Religio Philosophi or Natural Theology, Physicks or Natural philosophy\", London, Thomson, 1663. The word was first used in its Latin form by philosophers based on the Latin roots, which themselves are based on the Greek.\n\nLeibniz is the only one of the great philosophers of the 17th century to have used the term \"ontology\".\n\nSome philosophers, notably in the traditions of the Platonic school, contend that all nouns (including abstract nouns) refer to existent entities. Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities, but that some provide a kind of shorthand for reference to a collection either of objects or of events. In this latter view, \"mind\", instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of \"mental events\" experienced by a \"person\"; \"society\" refers to a collection of \"persons\" with some shared characteristics, and \"geometry\" refers to a collection of specific kinds of intellectual activities. Between these poles of realism and nominalism stand a variety of other positions.\n\nPrincipal questions of ontology include:\n\nVarious philosophers have provided different answers to these questions. One common approach involves dividing the extant subjects and predicates into groups called categories. Such lists of categories differ widely from one another, and it is through the co-ordination of different categorical schemes that ontology relates to such fields as library science and artificial intelligence. Such an understanding of ontological categories, however, is merely taxonomic, classificatory. Aristotle's categories are the ways in which a being may be addressed simply as a being, such as:\n\nFurther examples of ontological questions include:\n\nEssential ontological dichotomies include:\n\n\nPhilosophers can classify ontologies in various ways, using criteria such as the degree of abstraction and field of application:\n\n\nOntology is an aspect of the Samkhya school of philosophy from the first millennium BCE. The concept of Guna which describes the three properties (sattva, rajas and tamas) present in differing proportions in all existing things, is a notable concept of this school.\n\nParmenides was among the first in the Greek tradition to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of existence. In his prologue or proem he describes two views of existence; initially that nothing comes from nothing, and therefore existence is eternal. Consequently, our opinions about truth must often be false and deceitful. Most of western philosophy — including the fundamental concepts of falsifiability — have emerged from this view. This posits that existence is what may be conceived of by thought, created, or possessed. Hence, there may be neither void nor vacuum; and true reality neither may come into being nor vanish from existence. Rather, the entirety of creation is eternal, uniform, and immutable, though not infinite (he characterized its shape as that of a perfect sphere). Parmenides thus posits that change, as perceived in everyday experience, is illusory. Everything that may be apprehended is but one part of a single entity. This idea somewhat anticipates the modern concept of an ultimate grand unification theory that finally describes all of existence in terms of one inter-related sub-atomic reality which applies to everything.\n\nThe opposite of eleatic monism is the pluralistic conception of Being. In the 5th century BC, Anaxagoras and Leucippus replaced the reality of Being (unique and unchanging) with that of Becoming and therefore by a more fundamental and elementary ontic plurality. This thesis originated in the Hellenic world, stated in two different ways by Anaxagoras and by Leucippus. The first theory dealt with \"seeds\" (which Aristotle referred to as \"homeomeries\") of the various substances. The second was the atomistic theory, which dealt with reality as based on the vacuum, the atoms and their intrinsic movement in it.\n\nThe materialist atomism proposed by Leucippus was indeterminist, but then developed by Democritus in a deterministic way. It was later (4th century BC) that the original atomism was taken again as indeterministic by Epicurus. He confirmed the reality as composed of an infinity of indivisible, unchangeable corpuscles or atoms (\"atomon\", lit. 'uncuttable'), but he gives weight to characterize atoms while for Leucippus they are characterized by a \"figure\", an \"order\" and a \"position\" in the cosmos. They are, besides, creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the \"vacuum\", producing the diverse flux of being. Their movement is influenced by the \"parenklisis\" (Lucretius names it clinamen) and that is determined by the chance. These ideas foreshadowed our understanding of traditional physics until the nature of atoms was discovered in the 20th century.\n\nPlato developed this distinction between true reality and illusion, in arguing that what is real are eternal and unchanging Forms or Ideas (a precursor to universals), of which things experienced in sensation are at best merely copies, and real only in so far as they copy ('partake of') such Forms. In general, Plato presumes that all nouns (e.g., 'Beauty') refer to real entities, whether sensible bodies or insensible Forms. Hence, in \"The Sophist\" Plato argues that Being is a Form in which all existent things participate and which they have in common (though it is unclear whether 'Being' is intended in the sense of existence, copula, or identity); and argues, against Parmenides, that Forms must exist not only of Being, but also of Negation and of non-Being (or Difference).\n\nIn his \"Categories\", Aristotle identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. For Aristotle there are four different ontological dimensions:\n\nAccording to Avicenna, and in an interpretation of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval metaphysics, being is either necessary, contingent \"qua\" possible, or impossible. Necessary being is that which cannot but be, since its non-being entails a contradiction. Contingent \"qua\" possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its being is borrowed unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and is impossible for it not to be. As for the impossible, it necessarily does not exist, and the affirmation of its being is a contradiction.\n\nThe concept of 'ontological formations' refers to formations of social relations understood as dominant ways of living. Temporal, spatial, corporeal, epistemological and performative relations are taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation. That is, a particular ontological formation is based on how ontological categories of time, space, embodiment, knowing and performing are lived—objectively and subjectively. Different ontological formations include the customary (including the tribal), the traditional, the modern and the postmodern. The concept was first introduced by Paul James' \"Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism\" together with a series of writers including Damian Grenfell and Manfred Steger.\n\nIn the engaged theory approach, ontological formations are seen as layered and intersecting rather than singular formations. They are 'formations of being'. This approach avoids the usual problems of a Great Divide being posited between the modern and the pre-modern. From a philosophical distinction concerning different formations of being, the concept then provides a way of translating into practical understandings concerning how humans might design cities and communities that live creatively across different ontological formations, for example cities that are not completely dominated by modern valences of spatial configuration. Here the work of Tony Fry is important.\n\nRené Descartes, with \"je pense donc je suis\" or \"cogito ergo sum\" or \"I think, therefore I am\", argued that \"the self\" is something that we can know exists with epistemological certainty. Descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead to a proof of the certainty of the existence of God, using the ontological argument that had been formulated first by Anselm of Canterbury.\n\nCertainty about the existence of \"the self\" and \"the other\", however, came under increasing criticism in the 20th century. Sociological theorists, most notably George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman, saw the Cartesian Other as a \"Generalized Other\", the imaginary audience that individuals use when thinking about the self. According to Mead, \"we do not assume there is a self to begin with. Self is not presupposed as a stuff out of which the world arises. Rather, the self arises in the world\".\nThe Cartesian Other was also used by Sigmund Freud, who saw the superego as an abstract regulatory force, and Émile Durkheim who viewed this as a psychologically manifested entity which represented God in society at large.\n\nSchools of subjectivism, objectivism and relativism existed at various times in the 20th century, and the postmodernists and body philosophers tried to reframe all these questions in terms of bodies taking some specific action in an environment. This relied to a great degree on insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action in natural and artificial settings—as studied by biology, ecology, and cognitive science.\n\nThe processes by which bodies related to environments became of great concern, and the idea of being itself became difficult to really define. What did people mean when they said \"A is B\", \"A must be B\", \"A was B\"...? Some linguists advocated dropping the verb \"to be\" from the English language, leaving \"E Prime\", supposedly less prone to bad abstractions. Others, mostly philosophers, tried to dig into the word and its usage. Martin Heidegger distinguished \"human being\" as \"existence\" from the being of things in the world. Heidegger proposes that our way of being human and the way the world is for us are cast historically through a fundamental ontological questioning. These fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication in an age: a horizon of unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background meanings, such as human beings understood unquestioningly as subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly as objects. Because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated in everyday interactions, the locus of our way of being in a historical epoch is the communicative event of language in use. For Heidegger, however, communication in the \"first\" place is not among human beings, but language itself shapes up in response to questioning (the inexhaustible meaning of) being. Even the focus of traditional ontology on the 'whatness' or \"quidditas\" of beings in their substantial, standing presence can be shifted to pose the question of the 'whoness' of human being itself.\n\nSome philosophers suggest that the question of \"What is?\" is (at least in part) an issue of \"usage\" rather than a question about facts. This perspective is conveyed by an analogy made by Donald Davidson: Suppose a person refers to a 'cup' as a 'chair' and makes some comments pertinent to a cup, but uses the word 'chair' consistently throughout instead of 'cup'. One might readily catch on that this person simply calls a 'cup' a 'chair' and the oddity is explained. Analogously, if we find people asserting 'there are' such-and-such, and we do not ourselves think that 'such-and-such' exist, we might conclude that these people are not nuts (Davidson calls this assumption 'charity'), they simply use 'there are' differently than we do. The question of \"What is?\" is at least partially a topic in the philosophy of language, and is not entirely about ontology itself. This viewpoint has been expressed by Eli Hirsch.\n\nHirsch interprets Hilary Putnam as asserting that different concepts of \"the existence of something\" can be correct. This position does not contradict the view that some things do exist, but points out that different 'languages' will have different rules about assigning this property. How to determine the 'fitness' of a 'language' to the world then becomes a subject for investigation.\n\nCommon to all Indo-European copula languages is the double use of the verb \"to be\" in both stating that entity X exists (\"X is.\") as well as stating that X has a property (\"X is P\"). It is sometimes argued that a third use is also distinct, stating that X is a member of a class (\"X is a C\"). In other language families these roles may have completely different verbs and are less likely to be confused with one another. For example they might say something like \"the car has redness\" rather than \"the car is red\". Hence any discussion of \"being\" in Indo-European language philosophy may need to make distinctions between these senses.\n\nIn human geography there are two types of ontology: small \"o\" which accounts for the practical orientation, describing functions of being a part of the group, thought to oversimplify and ignore key activities. The other \"o\", or big \"O\", systematically, logically, and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal traits. This concept relates closely to Plato's view that the human mind can only perceive a bigger world if they continue to live within the confines of their \"caves\". However, in spite of the differences, ontology relies on the symbolic agreements among members. That said, ontology is crucial for the axiomatic language frameworks.\n\nAccording to A.N. Whitehead, for ontology, it is useful to distinguish the terms 'reality' and 'actuality'. In this view, an 'actual entity' has a philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority, while a 'real entity' is one which may be actual, or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some actual entity or entities. For example, an occasion in the life of Socrates is an actual entity. But Socrates' being a man does not make 'man' an actual entity, because it refers indeterminately to many actual entities, such as several occasions in the life of Socrates, and also to several occasions in the lives of Alcibiades, and of others. But the notion of man is real; it derives its reality from its reference to those many actual occasions, each of which is an actual entity. An actual occasion is a concrete entity, while terms such as 'man' are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities.\n\nAccording to Whitehead, an actual entity must earn its philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority by satisfying several philosophical criteria, as follows.\n\nWhitehead proposed that his notion of an occasion of experience satisfies the criteria for its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity. From a purely logical point of view, each occasion of experience has in full measure the characters of both objective and subjective reality. Subjectivity and objectivity refer to different aspects of an occasion of experience, and in no way do they exclude each other.\n\nExamples of other philosophical proposals or candidates as actual entities, in this view, are Aristotle's 'substances', Leibniz' monads, and Descartes \" ′res verae' \", and the more modern 'states of affairs'. Aristotle's substances, such as Socrates, have behind them as more fundamental the 'primary substances', and in this sense do not satisfy Whitehead's criteria. Whitehead is not happy with Leibniz' monads as actual entities because they are \"windowless\" and do not cause each other. 'States of affairs' are often not closely defined, often without specific mention of extension in physical Minkowski space; they are therefore not necessarily processes of becoming, but may be as their name suggests, simply static states in some sense. States of affairs are contingent on particulars, and therefore have something behind them. One summary of the Whiteheadian actual entity is that it is a process of becoming. Another summary, referring to its causal linkage to other actual entities, is that it is \"all window\", in contrast with Leibniz' windowless monads.\n\nThis view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities to really exist, but not as fundamentally and primarily factual or causally efficacious; they have existence as abstractions, with reality only derived from their reference to actual entities. A Whiteheadian actual entity has a unique and completely definite place and time. Whiteheadian abstractions are not so tightly defined in time and place, and in the extreme, some are timeless and placeless, or 'eternal' entities. All abstractions have logical or conceptual rather than efficacious existence; their lack of definite time does not make them unreal if they refer to actual entities. Whitehead calls this 'the ontological principle'.\n\nThere is an established and long philosophical history of the concept of atoms as microscopic physical objects.They are far too small to be visible to the naked eye. It was as recent as the nineteenth century that precise estimates of the sizes of putative physical atoms began to become plausible. Almost direct empirical observation of atomic effects was due to the theoretical investigation of Brownian motion by Albert Einstein in the very early twentieth century. But even then, the real existence of atoms was debated by some. Such debate might be labeled 'microcosmic ontology'. Here the word 'microcosm' is used to indicate a physical world of small entities, such as for example atoms.\n\nSubatomic particles are usually considered to be much smaller than atoms. Their real or actual existence may be very difficult to demonstrate empirically. A distinction is sometimes drawn between actual and virtual subatomic particles. Reasonably, one may ask, in what sense, if any, do virtual particles exist as physical entities? For atomic and subatomic particles, difficult questions arise, such as do they possess a precise position, or a precise momentum? A question that continues to be controversial is 'to what kind of physical thing, if any, does the quantum mechanical wave function refer?'.\n\nThe first ontological argument in the Western Christian tradition was proposed by Anselm of Canterbury in his 1078 work \"Proslogion\". Anselm defined God as \"that than which nothing greater can be thought\", and argued that this being must exist in the mind, even in the mind of the person who denies the existence of God. He suggested that, if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality. If it only exists in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one which exists both in the mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality. Seventeenth century French philosopher René Descartes deployed a similar argument. Descartes published several variations of his argument, each of which centred on the idea that God's existence is immediately inferable from a \"clear and distinct\" idea of a supremely perfect being. In the early eighteenth century, Gottfried Leibniz augmented Descartes' ideas in an attempt to prove that a \"supremely perfect\" being is a coherent concept. A more recent ontological argument came from Kurt Gödel, who proposed a formal argument for God's existence. Norman Malcolm revived the ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second, stronger ontological argument in Anselm's work; Alvin Plantinga challenged this argument and proposed an alternative, based on modal logic. Attempts have also been made to validate Anselm's proof using an automated theorem prover. Other arguments have been categorised as ontological, including those made by Islamic philosophers Mulla Sadra and Allama Tabatabai.\n\nJaakko Hintikka puts the view that a useful explication of the notion of existence is in the words \"one can find\", implicitly in some world or universe of discourse.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1946, inspired by the American Frank Buchman, he was instrumental in the acquisition of the former Caux Palace Hotel, a dilapidated hotel above Montreux, Switzerland, by a group of about 100 Swiss, in order to create an international conference centre at the service of European reconciliation and reconstruction. He wrote a dozen of books of political and social philosophy.\n\nThe scion of an old Geneva family whose ancestor Jacques Mottu had moved to Geneva towards 1597, Philippe Mottu is the son of the pastor Henri Mottu, moderator of the « vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Genève », and of Marthe Mottu, née Reverdin.\nA graduate of the Political Science school of the Geneva University, he started his professional life in a bank. In 1933 he underwent a deep spiritual experience which led him to undertake theology studies in Lausanne. There, his Latin professor, Jules Rochat, put him in touch with the Oxford Group, soon to become Moral Rearmament (and currently Initiatives of Change). He was immediately won by the ideas and practice of the Oxford Group.\n\nIn 1935, Philippe Mottu meets for the first time Frank Buchman, the Oxford Group's founder who visits Geneva with a team in order to talk to League of Nations delegates. It is the beginning of a lifelong friendship, with its ups and downs, through which the two men will exchange abundant correspondence.\n\nIn 1938, as European nations re-armed for war, Buchman called for 'moral and spiritual re-armament' as the way to build a 'hate-free, fear-free, greed-free world'. Enthusiastic, Philippe Mottu became one of the main activists of Moral Reamament (MRA) in Switzerland. In this capacity he participated in numerous MRA actions at home and abroad, particularly the massive meeting of Palais Baulieu in Lausanne in 1937 (10’000 participants) or the international meeting of Interlaken in 1938.\n\nIn 1939 Philippe Mottu was called into active service and joined the \"Army and Home\" section at the Swiss Army's headquarters, probably at General Guisan's request as the general partly relied on MRA to build up Swiss morale and resistance spirit.\nWith Denis de Rougemont and Theophil Spoerri, he took an active part in the setting up of the Gotthard League, a civil society movement dedicated to countering \"defeatism and deceptive propaganda\" in the face of intense Nazi propaganda which Switzerland was subject to at the time. \"We wanted to proclaim that our country would remain faithful to his multi-secular democratic tradition\", he explained.\n\nHe then joined the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs in Bern.\n\nIn 1940, Philippe Mottu established contact with a German diplomat in Bern, Herbert Blankenhorn, and, through him, with Adam von Trott zu Solz, one of the leaders of German resistance to Nazism. Upon von Trott's invitation, Mottu travelled to Berlin in November 1942 where he meets with other members of the resistance. During a British bombardment, a top German Foreign Affairs official, Hans-Bernd von Haften, asked him: \"As Christians, are we allowed to kill Hitler?\"\n\nSupported by the Swiss foreign minister, Marcel Pilet-Golaz, Philippe Mottu continued his contacts with von Trott and offered to act as a liaison person between the allied powers and the German Resistance by travelling himself to the United States, even though it was difficult to travel outside Switzerland. In April 1944, von Trott visited Switzerland where he was promised assistance to reach Lisbon, while Allen Dulles, chief of the OSS in Switzerland, promised his assistance for a transatlantic trip. A few days after the joint US-British Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, Mottu was in Stuttgart with von Trott and his group of friends : their coup was imminent. Mottu left for Washington having memorised all the names of the new German government.\n\nTo his despair, President Roosevelt and his advisors didn’t believe in the German resistance. Additionally on 20 July 1944, Operation Walkyrie failed. His worst fears became reality when, in the course of the following weeks and months, he got confirmation of the arrest and execution of all the main conspirators : von Trott, von Haften and hundreds of others...\n\nPhilippe Mottu had been deeply affected by his experience during WWII. In 1943 already, a recurring thought had come to him: \"If Switzerland escapes the ravages of this war, its mission will be to create a venue where French and Germans will be able to reconcile and build peace. Caux is the place.\"\n\nWith the financial support of around 100 Swiss families, Philippe Mottu and one of his friends Robert Hahnloser bought the derelict Caux Palace Hotel in 1946. It was repaired and refurbished thanks to the efforts of the Swiss and international teams, and, between 1946 and 1950, it welcomed thousands of French and German participants, among whom Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman, who will later rely on their exceptional mutual trust to launch the first steps of the European construction. The Caux summer conferences dedicated to peace and reconciliation are still taking place today.\n\nPhilippe Mottu contributed to the governance of the Caux conference centre from 1946 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1973 as a member of the Caux Foundation council. He was the Foundation's first president, from 1946 to 1958. Later on, he increasingly turned to the writing of numerous political philosophy books.\n\nOn , Philippe Mottu married Hélène de Trey. They will have four children, and, on the date of Philippe Mottu's death, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.\n\nHis younger brother Daniel Mottu will be the Caux Foundation's president from 1977 to 1987.\n\nPhilippe Mottu wrote several books on international, political and social issues. Building on a vast culture and on a rigorous analysis of his time's trends, he for instance exposed the rise of intolerance and extremism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam; he was searching in which way humanity would adapt to the momentous transformations of the 20th century, and develop a harmonious society in the future, expressing the hope is that humanity will find spiritual resources allowing it to envisage its future with « a measure of serenity\".\n\nList of Philippe Mottu's publications:\n\nAs a thinker and as an activist, Philippe Mottu played a role in Swiss and European history, contributing to reinforce the spirit of resistance to fascism in Switzerland through the Gotthard League, to support German resistance to Hitler and on the European scene in triggering the setting up of the Caux conference Centre.\n\nPioneer of Moral Rearmament in Switzerland, he left to the next generations the Caux conference centre, of which he was the inspirator and one of the most instrumental administrators. He was also a daring entrepreneur who signed the purchase contract for Caux in 1946, together with Robert Hahnloser, risking his name without knowing whether the necessary funds would be found in order to meet the down payments deadline.\n\n"}

{"id": "5728387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5728387", "title": "Secondary notation", "text": "Secondary notation\n\nSecondary notation is the set of visual cues used to improve the readability of a formal notation. Examples of secondary notation include the syntax highlighting of computer source code, sizes and color codes for easy recognition of consumer symbols such as bank notes or coins, or the regular typographic conventions often found in technical books to highlight sections with the same type of content.\n\nSecondary notation provides redundant (more than necessary) information; if the visual cues are the only way that some information is provided, such as in traffic lights, or a chart's key, it is not secondary. Secondary notation is often not a part of the formal notation itself. Rather, it is a method of organizing the formal notation to allow it to be more easily understood. Thus, secondary notation does not change the actual meaning of the formal notation, rather it allows for the meaning to be readily understood. In text such as programming languages, this can be done using cues such as indentation and coloring. In formal graphical notations, this can be done through the use of symmetry or proximity to indicate relatedness.\n\nSecondary notation annotates formal notation in a number of contexts which can be broken down to two main domains: text and graphics.\n\nThere are a number of common instances of secondary notation that are seen in text. Secondary notation is common in typography and in code editors appearing as boldness, italics, and spacing/indentation.\n\nSecondary notation in the form of coloring and indentation is commonly implemented in integrated development environments to make source code more readable and make the formal notation more understandable. The following C source code does not use secondary notation to ease the interpretation of the formal notation:\n\ncodice_1\n\nThe following is the same code, but with indentation and syntax highlighting. As a result, the formal notation of C is easier to read:\n\nA number of examples of secondary notation that commonly appear in English writing include\n\n\nSecondary notation is commonly used in graphical contexts to better convey information beyond what the formal notation of the graphic makes explicit.\n\nA graphical representation that has been well studied and can be heavily impacted by secondary notation is a flowchart and especially drakon-charts. Research has shown that there are a number of layout factors unincorporated into the formal notation that impact a flowchart's ease of understanding:\n\nThe examples on the right show how these techniques can drastically affect the ease of understanding when looking at a process model. The model depicts a simplified process for ordering products from a website. Both diagrams contain exactly the same blocks with the same interconnections. However, the one that uses better secondary notation can be readily understood whereas the other model requires careful analysis to understand its contents.\n\nWhile inadequate use of secondary notation can significantly increase the amount of effort necessary to understand a model, misuse of secondary notation can also be a detriment. Use of symmetry can make a graphic more visually appealing, but can also convey misconceptions if used incorrectly. For instance, placing unrelated items close together may cause a reader to perceive them as being related. Additionally, arbitrary use of coloring may distract a reader as they wonder about the meanings of the various colors.\n\nThe ability of individuals to understand and use secondary notation has been shown to vary based on experience within the relevant field. Experts in a field are generally more able to utilize the clues provided by secondary notation. Specifically, while reading diagrams, experts have been shown to have more skill at reading the larger structure of the diagram and using it to guide their examination of the details provided by the formal notation. This compares to novices who often focusing on the details of the formal notation and ignoring the hints provided by the secondary notation.\n\nThere are also differences based on level of experience/expertise when creating documents that utilize secondary notation. Experts tend to be more consistent in their use of conventions while novices tend to vary between conventions, sometimes adhering on a surface level, but failing to convey the desired information. In the case of circuit diagrams, this is illustrated by common novice mistakes such as creating visual symmetry where there is no logical symmetry and frequent transitions between differing secondary notation conventions.\n\nIn some cases, secondary notation is part of the formal notation. Such formal notations attempt to improve readability by enforcing the presence of visual cues. The trade-off is that, what in many other cases is only secondary notation (like, for example, indentation in free-form languages), is now part of the formal notation, and thus is not optional.\n\nFor example, the Python programming language requires source code to follow strict indentation rules. This is intended to improve readability of the code, by ensuring that statements that are at the same level of nesting within a block are aligned to the same column. Other types of secondary notation, however, are not part of the formal notation. For example, when wrapping long lines, every line that is a continuation of a previous line can be indented arbitrarily.\nMarkdown also uses indentation as part of the formal syntax of the language. Indentation is required in Markdown when creating certain source code representations of block quotations as well as when creating sections of source code to be rendered as the code itself.\n\n"}

A Setoid may also be called E-set, Bishop set, or extensional set.\n\nSetoids are studied especially in proof theory and in type-theoretic foundations of mathematics. Often in mathematics, when one defines an equivalence relation on a set, one immediately forms the quotient set (turning equivalence into equality). In contrast, setoids may be used when a difference between identity and equivalence must be maintained, often with an interpretation of intensional equality (the equality on the original set) and extensional equality (the equivalence relation, or the equality on the quotient set).\n\nIn proof theory, particularly the proof theory of constructive mathematics based on the Curry–Howard correspondence, one often identifies a mathematical proposition with its set of proofs (if any). A given proposition may have many proofs, of course; according to the principle of proof irrelevance, normally only the truth of the proposition matters, not which proof was used. However, the Curry–Howard correspondence can turn proofs into algorithms, and differences between algorithms are often important. So proof theorists may prefer to identify a proposition with a \"setoid\" of proofs, considering proofs equivalent if they can be converted into one another through beta conversion or the like.\n\nIn type-theoretic foundations of mathematics, setoids may be used in a type theory that lacks quotient types to model general mathematical sets. For example, in Per Martin-Löf's intuitionistic type theory, there is no type of real numbers, only a type of regular Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. To do real analysis in Martin-Löf's framework, therefore, one must work with a \"setoid\" of real numbers, the type of regular Cauchy sequences equipped with the usual notion of equivalence. Predicates and functions of real numbers need to be defined for regular Cauchy sequences and proven to be compatible with the equivalence relation. Typically (although it depends on the type theory used), the axiom of choice will hold for functions between types (intensional functions), but not for functions between setoids (extensional functions). The term \"set\" is variously used either as a synonym of \"type\" or as a synonym of \"setoid\".\n\nIn constructive mathematics, one often takes a setoid with an apartness relation instead of an equivalence relation, called a constructive setoid. One sometimes also considers a partial setoid using a partial equivalence relation or partial apartness. (see e.g. Barthe \"et al.\", section 1)\n\n\n\n"}

It is marked by the concept of personality and the actions of the individuals. This sphere constitutes what Isaiah Berlin would call negative freedom, which is to say, freedom ascertained through the denial of outside impetus.\n\nThe \"second sphere\" constitutes Kantian morality, and is therefore called the sphere of morality (\"Moralität\"). This sphere constitutes what Isaiah Berlin would call positive freedom, which is to say, moral autonomy. However, Hegel criticizes the deployment of Kantian morality in society for being insufficient. He explains this deficiency through philosophical critique of pathologies such as loneliness, depression and agony.\n\nThe \"third sphere\", the sphere of ethical life (\"Sittlichkeit\"), is marked by family, civil society and the State.\n\nTo properly understand the movement from the two first spheres to the last, one must understand that \"Sittlichkeit\"'s normativity transcends the individual—while \"Moralität\" may be rational and reflective, it is also individualistic. The third sphere is an attempt at describing a limited conception of the person through an appeal to the greater institutional context of the community and an attempt at bridging individual subjective feelings and the concept of general rights. \n\nThe term \"Sittlichkeit\" had already been used by Hegel before—in his \"Phenomenology of Spirit\"—to refer to \"ethical behavior grounded in custom and tradition and developed through habit and imitation in accordance with the objective laws of the community.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "984629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=984629", "title": "Social complexity", "text": "Social complexity\n\nIn sociology, social complexity is a conceptual framework used in the analysis of society. Contemporary definitions of complexity in the sciences are found in relation to systems theory, in which a phenomenon under study has many parts and many possible arrangements of the relationships between those parts. At the same time, what is complex and what is simple is relative and may change with time.\n\nCurrent usage of the term \"complexity\" in the field of sociology typically refers specifically to theories of society as a complex adaptive system. However, social complexity and its emergent properties are central recurring themes throughout the historical development of social thought and the study of social change. The early founders of sociological theory, such as Ferdinand Tönnies, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto, and Georg Simmel, all examined the exponential growth and increasing interrelatedness of social encounters and exchanges. This emphasis on interconnectivity in social relationships and the emergence of new properties within society is found in theoretical thinking in multiple areas of sociology. As a theoretical tool, social complexity theory serves as a basis for the connection of micro- and macro-level social phenomena, providing a meso-level or middle-range theoretical platform for hypothesis formation. Methodologically, the concept of social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local (micro) and global (macro) phenomena in sociological research.\n\nThe American sociologist Talcott Parsons carried on the work of the early founders mentioned above in his early (1937) work on action theory. By 1951, Parsons places these earlier ideas firmly into the realm of formal systems theory in \"The Social System\". For the next several decades, this synergy between general systems thinking and the further development of social system theories is carried forward by Parson's student, Robert K. Merton, and a long line of others, in discussions of theories of the middle-range and social structure and agency. During part of this same period, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, discussion ensues in any number of other research areas about the properties of systems in which strong correlation of sub-parts leads to observed behaviors variously described as autopoetic, self-organizing, dynamical, turbulent, and chaotic. All of these are forms of system behavior arising from mathematical complexity. By the early 1990s, the work of social theorists such as Niklas Luhmann began reflecting these themes of complex behavior.\n\nOne of the earliest usages of the term \"complexity\", in the social and behavioral sciences, to refer specifically to a complex system is found in the study of modern organizations and management studies. However, particularly in management studies, the term often has been used in a metaphorical rather than in a qualitative or quantiative theoretical manner. By the mid-1990s, the \"complexity turn\" in social sciences begins as some of the same tools generally used in complexity science are incorporated into the social sciences. By 1998, the international, electronic periodical, \"Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation\", had been created. In the last several years, many publications have presented overviews of complexity theory within the field of sociology. Within this body of work, connections also are drawn to yet other theoretical traditions, including constructivist epistemology and the philosophical positions of phenomenology, postmodernism and critical realism.\n\nMethodologically, social complexity is theory-neutral, meaning that it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts and there are many possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.\n\nAt the most localized level of analysis, ethnographic, participant- or non-participant observation, content analysis and other qualitative research methods may be appropriate. More recently, highly sophisticated quantitative research methodologies are being developed and used in sociology at both local and global levels of analysis. Such methods include (but are not limited to) bifurcation diagrams, network analysis, non-linear modeling, and computational models including cellular automata programming, sociocybernetics and other methods of social simulation.\n\nComplex social network analysis is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional social network analysis, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network analysis are coming out of the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.\n\nNew methods of global network analysis are emerging from the work of John Urry and the sociological study of globalization, linked to the work of Manuel Castells and the later work of Immanuel Wallerstein. Since the late 1990s, Wallerstein increasingly makes use of complexity theory, particularly the work of Ilya Prigogine. Dynamic social network analysis is linked to a variety of methodological traditions, above and beyond systems thinking, including graph theory, traditional social network analysis in sociology, and mathematical sociology. It also links to mathematical chaos and complex dynamics through the work of Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, as well as fractal geometry through Albert-László Barabási and his work on scale-free networks.\n\nThe development of computational sociology involves such scholars as Nigel Gilbert, Klaus G. Troitzsch, Joshua M. Epstein, and others. The foci of methods in this field include social simulation and data-mining, both of which are sub-areas of computational sociology. Social simulation uses computers to create an artificial laboratory for the study of complex social systems; data-mining uses machine intelligence to search for non-trivial patterns of relations in large, complex, real-world databases. The emerging methods of socionics are a variant of computational sociology.\n\nComputational sociology is influenced by a number of micro-sociological areas as well as the macro-level traditions of systems science and systems thinking. The micro-level influences of symbolic interaction, exchange, and rational choice, along with the micro-level focus of computational political scientists, such as Robert Axelrod, helped to develop computational sociology's bottom-up, agent-based approach to modeling complex systems. This is what Joshua M. Epstein calls generative science. Other important areas of influence include statistics, mathematical modeling and computer simulation.\n\nSociocybernetics integrates sociology with second-order cybernetics and the work of Niklas Luhmann, along with the latest advances in complexity science. In terms of scholarly work, the focus of sociocybernetics has been primarily conceptual and only slightly methodological or empirical. Sociocybernetics is directly tied to systems thought inside and outside of sociology, specifically in the area of second-order cybernetics.\n\nAs a middle-range theoretical platform, social complexity can be applied to any research in which social interaction or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be measured and expressed as continuous or discrete data points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data. Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology. From childhood friendships and teen pregnancy to criminology and counter-terrorism, theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all areas of sociological research.\n\nIn the area of communications research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications. Scientometrics and bibliometrics are areas of research in which discrete data are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, the diversity of areas of application has grown as more sophisticated methods have developed. Social complexity theory is applied in studies of social cooperation and public goods; altruism; voting behavior; education; global civil unrest; collective action and social movements; social inequality; workforce and unemployment; economic geography and economic sociology; policy analysis; health care systems; and innovation and social change, to name a few. A current international scientific research project, the Seshat: Global History Databank, was explicitly designed to analyze changes in social complexity from the Neolithic Revolution until the Industrial Revolution.\n\n"}

A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as genetic makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be socially constructed.\n\nThe socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an ideology within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to stimuli are predetermined to adhere to the social rules imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which \"have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest\" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has \"significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda\" (Colaguori 35).\n\nBy creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a hegemonic control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.\n\nSocial determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. \"We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what \"is\" said, and how it is \"selectively presented\", is a far more powerful form of information control.\" (Colaguori 35).\n\nSocial determinism was first studied by Emile Durkheim (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.\n\nSocial determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to biological determinism. Within the media studies discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.\nTechnological determinism is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.\n\nThe notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.\n\nIn her book \"Technoculture\" Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. \n\nAccording to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.\n\nThus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. \n\nScientific studies have shown that social behavior is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.\n\nSocial pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the ontogeny of social interaction. Also informally referred to as, \"wired to be social.\" The theory questions whether there is a propensity to socially oriented action already present \"before\" birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique genetic wiring to be social.\n\nCircumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.\n\nPrincipal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.\n\nThe social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, \"The central advance of this study is the demonstration that 'social actions' are already performed in the second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.\".\n\n\nColaguori, Claudio.

The term has since been adopted as the name of numerous groups, schools, and businesses.\n\nA group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners from the Bay Area, founded in late 1939 through the merging of two groups of architects, one from San Francisco and the other from the University of California, Berkeley, called themselves Telesis. Philosophically, the group also evolved from several larger international architectural movements, which included CIAM (Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne) and MARS (Modern Architectural Research Group).\n\nTheir stated aim was to research the development and implications of what architectural critic Lewis Mumford called the Second Bay Area Regional Style. As set forth in their founding statement, the group believed that \"People and the Land make up the environment which has four distinct parts--a place to Live, Work, Play, and the Services which integrate these and make them operate. These components must be integrated in the community and urban region through rational planning, and through the use of modern building technology.\"—from \"The Things Telesis Has Found Important\"\n\nNoted Telesis members included William Wurster, Catherine Bauer Wurster, Vernon DeMars, Thomas Church, Garrett Eckbo, Grace McCann Morley, Geraldine Knight Scott, Joseph Allen Stein, Jack Hillmer, Francis Violich, and T. J. Kent, Jr. In addition to internal research and working groups that investigated such topics as speculative housing, industrial design, and the relationship of the physical environment of the San Francisco Bay Area to indigenous architectural styles, the group also organized several influential exhibitions on contemporary architecture and planning with the support of the San Francisco Museum of Art. Professional and personal papers from many of Telesis's members are collected in the Environmental Design Archives at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe mechanics of society fall under two general groups: social statics and social dynamics. Social dynamics is further divided into social genesis and social telesis. Social telesis may be further divided into individual telesis and collective telesis.\n\n\nTelesis (Greek: Telos, end, + -osis, condition), defined as \"the intelligent direction of effort toward the achievement of an end.\", has also been a term used in the context of epistemology and ontology to refer to \"infocognitive potential\", a concept originating from Christopher Langan and his theory of everything, the CTMU. In his 2002 paper on the CTMU, Langan defines telesis in the following passage:\n\n\n"}

Transcendental arguments may have additional standards of justification that are more demanding than those of traditional deductive arguments.\n\nTypically, a transcendental argument starts from some accepted aspect of experience, and then deduces what must be true for that type of experience to be possible. Transcendental arguments are often used as arguments against skepticism, usually about the reality of the external world or other minds.\n\nSo-called progressive transcendental arguments begin with an apparently indubitable and universally accepted statement about people's experiences of the world, and use this to make substantive knowledge-claims about the world, e.g., that it \"is\" causally and spatiotemporally related. They start with what is left at the \"end\" of the skeptics process of doubting.\n\nRegressive transcendental arguments, on the other hand, \"begin at the same point\" as the skeptic, e.g., the fact that we have experience as of a causal and spatiotemporal world, and show that certain notions are implicit in our conceptions of such experience. Regressive transcendental arguments are more conservative in that they do not purport to make substantive ontological claims about the world.\n\nAn example is used by Kant in his refutation of idealism. Idealists believe that the experience of objects independent of our mind is not legitimate. Briefly, Kant shows that\n\n\nHe has not established that outer objects exist, but only that the concept of them is legitimate, contrary to idealism.\n\nNot all use of transcendental arguments are intended to counter skepticism, however. The Dutch philosopher, Herman Dooyeweerd, used transcendental critique to establish the conditions that make a theoretical attitude of thought (not just the process of thinking, as in Kant) possible. In particular he showed that theoretical thought cannot be neutral, rather, must be based on presuppositions that are \"religious\" in nature (in the sense of pre-theoretical commitment).\n\nIt was Immanuel Kant who gave transcendental arguments their name and notoriety. It is controversial, though, whether his own transcendental arguments should be classified as progressive or regressive.\n\nIn the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781) Kant developed one of philosophy's most famous transcendental arguments in 'The Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding'. In the 'Transcendental Aesthetic', Kant used transcendental arguments to show that sensory experiences would not be possible apart from our contributing to them their spatial and temporal form.\n\nAs stated above, one of the main uses of transcendental arguments is to use one thing we can know, the nature of our experiences, to counter skeptics' arguments that we cannot \"know\" something or other about the nature of the world. One need not be a skeptic about those matters, however, to find transcendental arguments unpersuasive. There are a number of ways that one might deny that a given transcendental argument gives us knowledge of the world. The following responses may suit some versions and not others.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Derived from the civil rights movement, student movement and anti-war movements, the Women's Liberation Movement took rhetoric from the civil rights idea of liberating victims of discrimination from oppression. They were not interested in reforming existing social structures, but instead were focused on changing the perceptions of women's place in society and the family and women's autonomy. Rejecting hierarchical structure, most groups which formed operated as collectives where all women could participate equally. Typically, groups associated with the Women's Liberation Movement held consciousness-raising meetings where women could voice their concerns and experiences, learning to politicize their issues. To members of the WLM rejecting sexism was the most important objective in eliminating women's status as second-class citizens.\n\nIn North America, the movement began in the United States and Canada almost simultaneously with the first articles articulating their aims appearing around 1965. By 1967, organizations had formed in major US and Canadian cities spreading within a year throughout both countries. In Mexico, sparked by the movement in the north, groups began to form in 1971. Characterized as man-haters and radicals, the movement in North America gave way to more liberal reformers by the mid-1970s in the United States and Canada and by the early 1980s in Mexico.\n\nThe Women's Liberation Movement in Canada derived from the anti-war movement, Native Rights Movement and the New Left student movement of the 1960s. An increase in university enrollment, sparked by the post-World War II baby boom, created a student body which believed that they could be catalysts for social change. Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, ethnic empowerment, and peace, as well as gay and women's liberation. The Canadian magazine, \"Chatelaine\" serialized Betty Friedan's \"The Feminine Mystique\" and published articles on birth control, modifications needed for the divorce laws, and other women's issues, making them public concerns. Institutionalized feminists, (liberal feminism) focused efforts on forming a royal commission to evaluate women’s status and address them through reforms, but grass-roots feminists desired more radical change.\n\nAs early as 1967, women in Toronto had formed a Women's Liberation Group and in July 1968, a group of women students at Simon Fraser University (SFU) organized the Feminine Action League (FAL). Faculty, like Margaret Benston supported Women's Lib encouraging studies to gain an understanding of women's societal roles and the perception of women's place both by themselves and by men. In that year, the U.S. organization SNCC barred whites from participating in leadership positions, influencing the founders of FAL to ban men in their organization. Though often depicted in media as a sign of \"man-hating\", separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women’s inequality as child-rearers, citizens, sexual objects, wives, workers, etc. were commonly experienced by women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status. Politicizing personal issues was done in consciousness-raising sessions aimed at eliminating the need to rally support for abstract causes, because the issues were those impacting women's daily lives. Soon after their forming, the group changed their name to the SFU Women's Caucus and initially focused on contraception and pregnancy prevention for students. In July 1969, the group moved off-campus, to downtown Vancouver, opening offices as the Vancouver Women's Caucus (VWC). They began publishing a newspaper, \"Pedestal\", focused on women's liberation and protesting sexist hierarchy and male-domination in the student movement. Women's Caucuses also formed at the University of Alberta and the University of Regina, as offshoots of the Students for a Democratic Union (SDU) and at the University of Toronto aligned with the Student Union for Peace Action (SUPA). As in the U.S. a network of women's centers, which included spaces like the Ste-Famille Women's Centre in Montreal and the Prince George Women's Centre in northern British Columbia developed to facilitate meetings of women and provide them with services.\n\nWLM groups sprang up throughout Canada, though in Quebec there was a struggle over whether women's liberation or Québécois liberation should be the focus for women radicals. Advocating public self-expression, such as participating in protests and sit-ins, organizations affiliated with the movement tended to operate on a consensus-based structure and participated in consciousness-raising, like their U.S. counterparts. However, Canadian Women's Lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from U.S. liberation theory. For example, Frances Wasserlein, a prominent LGBT and feminist activist who chronicled the history of the Abortion Caravan, argued that to be involved in the WLM in Vancouver equated to being a socialist. Some of the first actions of the VWC were to protest discriminatory hiring and wage practices of the Civil Service Commission against women. Other direct actions included the occupation of a building on the University of Toronto campus by the Toronto Women Liberation Movement. Having tried to negotiate with the university to establish day care centers and failing in their efforts, they took over a university-owned house, cleared out the squatters, and renovated it for their children.\n\nIn response to the passage of a reform to the civil code on abortions in 1969, the VWC began a series of protests focused on abortion. Marge Hollibaugh and other liberationists organized the Western Regional Conference on Women's Liberation, which was held during the Thanksgiving weekend at the University of British Columbia campus to spread the word about the upcoming caravan. Betsy Wood organized a guerrilla theatre performance on Valentine's Day 1970 at the Vancouver Courthouse to illustrate the inequalities which could emerge from allowing Therapeutic Abortion Committees to make decisions for women and the consequences of denying procedures which could be suicide or back-alley abortions. It was also Wood's idea to organize the caravan, which she had proposed at the October conference. Members of the VWC left Vancouver on 27 April performing guerrilla theatre along the way. They reached Ottawa on 9 May and assembled with other WLM groups from throughout Canada at Parliament Hill. Over the next three days, they managed to stage a protest at the home of the Prime Minister and disrupt the House of Commons, shutting it down for the first time in history.\n\nIn Quebec, 1969 was also pivotal, with the establishment of the Women's Liberation Front (). Their slogan was \"Pas de libération des femmes sans libération du Québec! Pas de libération du Québec sans libération des femmes!\" (No liberation of women without liberation of Quebec! No liberation of Quebec without women's liberation!) and they supported changes to gain socio-economic and political equality, but also pressed for Quebec's autonomy and a recognition of the unpaid labor of women working in the home and in family businesses. One of their first demonstrations was against the prohibition of public protests put forth by the administration of Montreal's mayor, Jean Drapeau. In 1970, Nicole Thérien and set forth a manifesto proclaiming that in a society defined by exploiters and the exploited, woman and Québécois citizens were slaves of the exploited. That same year the FLF founded a newspaper called \"Québécoise deboytte!\" (Quebec women standing up!) in protest to mainstream media's curtailment of women's voices.\n\nIn November 1970 the first national conference of the WLM was held in Saskatoon. Marlene Dixon, a sociology professor teaching at McGill University debunked the idea of an autonomous women's movement, encouraging women to join extant movements fighting racism and classism. The radical movement in Canada was shaped by these opposing views of whether women could gain equality within the existing socio-economic/political system or whether capitalism had to be overturned to create human equality. In 1973, Rosemary Brown, the first Black Canadian woman elected to a provincial legislature in the country, spoke at the national congress of the Canadian Negro Women's Association. She embraced the ideas of the WLM and rejected the idea that black women were needed in the struggle for black men to achieve equality. Rather than being an anti-male position, she believed that black men were not weak and in need of women propping them up. She saw the movement as one which validated the human import of males and females.\n\nIn 1971, Lisa Balcer, called as a witness for the trial of Paul Rose in the kidnappings perpetrated by the Quebec Liberation Front the previous year, refused to testify because women were not allowed to serve as jurors. She was declared to be in contempt of court. Seven women from the courtroom who were members of the FLF stood and protested legal discrimination of women. All seven were arrested and served from one to two months in jail, but their action brought attention to the problems of inequality. A few months after their protest, women gained the right to serve as jurors in Quebec.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Marxist and liberationists' alliance fractured in part because of media characterization of radicals in the grass-roots movement as \"crazy\", but in part because the radical grass-roots groups had difficulty mobilizing women under abstract theories. Bonnie Kreps, who wrote \"Radical Feminism 1\" which was published in 1973 in the anthology \"Radical Feminism: The Book\" portrayed Canadian feminists as falling into three categories: socialist feminists, who were opposed to capitalism; liberal feminists, who were concerned with equal rights and equal pay; and radical feminists who focused on \"the oppression of women as women\" or sexism. Activists who had been involved in the WLM turned their efforts toward violence against women, when the liberal feminists gained the dominant position and public perception that legal change to the existing systems were the legitimate concerns of the women's movement. In 2007, Marjolaine Péloquin, published a history of the movement in Quebec, \"En prison pour la cause des femmes: la conquête du banc des jurés\" (In prison for the cause of women: the conquest of the jury box), critically analyzing the short-lived but significant impact of the FLF.\n\nJust as the Women's Suffrage movement grew out of the Abolition Movement, the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights. Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of second-wave feminism. Rather than simply desiring legal equality, members believed that the moral and social climate in the United States needed to change. Though most groups operated independently—there was no national umbrella organization—there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate, participants in the movement believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society. One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced. They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions. Among the issues were the objectification of women, reproductive rights, opportunities for women in the workplace, redefining familial roles. A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism.\n\nThe publication of \"The Feminine Mystique\" by Friedan pointed to the dissatisfaction of many women in American society and was seen as a catalyst for the movement, though after she co-founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966, Friedan was seen by radicals as too mainstream. NOW's stated purpose was to work within established social and legal systems to gain equality, which clashed with radical feminists who believed that traditional power-structures had failed women and needed to be reformed. In 1964, an anonymous paper (later revealed to have been written by Elaine Delott Baker, Casey Hayden, Mary King, and Emmie Schrader), \"The Position of Women in SNCC\" (the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) was presented by Ruby Doris Smith-Robinson at the Waveland conference. The paper discussed the analogous relationship between sex and race discrimination within the context of the work environment and was seen as a critically important document for evaluating gender and women's issues. Stokely Carmichael's response to the paper, \"The only position for women in SNCC is prone\", has been taken by some to have been condescending, but Carol Giardina argued in her work \"Freedom for Women: Forging the Women's Liberation Movement\" that the statement was made jokingly and that focus on the controversy about Carmichael's remark deflects the positive reinforcement and leadership opportunities that many women found within the SNCC.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1966 meetings, at which papers and conversations about women's place in society were discussed, became more prevalent. An article published in \"Random\", a Canadian journal, advocated that women should participate in self-examination without male scrutiny or advice to embark on their own path of self-discovery. In the summer of 1967 at the Students for a Democratic Society’s national conference, a manifesto drafted by the Women’s Liberation Workshop defined the relationship of women to men as one that a colonial power had toward its colonies. The document demanded that men take responsibility for their male chauvinism and that women demand full participation in all activities of the organization. Following the meeting, women's groups such as the Bread and Roses in Boston and Women's Liberation Group of Berkeley were founded. In Chicago, at a women's workshop held over Labor Day weekend that same year during the National Conference of New Politics (NCNP), Jo Freeman and Shulamith Firestone presented demands from the woman's caucus to the plenary session. The moderator advised that the points of their resolution were insignificant and did not merit discussion on the floor. Over their protests and refusing to discuss the demands further, NCNP Director William F. Pepper moved the topic toward a discussion of Native Americans, but agreed to tack on their concerns to the end of the agenda. Dismissively, Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, \"Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation\", or possibly, \"Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems.\"\n\nSoon after the meeting Freeman, Heather Booth, and Naomi Weisstein founded the Women's Radical Action Project (WRAP), as a vehicle for consciousness-raising. At these meetings, women met regularly to discuss personal dilemmas and to analyze how politics shaped and impacted women's lives. Consciousness-raising discussions were wide-ranging from intimate relationships to social justice issues, with participants stressing the importance of not only having choices but being free to make them. Their discussions recognized that legislation could not change many of the issues which confronted women, but that education and redefining societal roles would be required to change attitudes and mores. Within six months, the \"voice of women's liberation\" began publication by Freeman as the first radical newspaper of the movement. Firestone left the Chicago conference and returned to New York to found the New York Radical Women (NYRW) with Pamela Allen, among others. It was the \"first women's liberation group in New York City\", and followed a radical feminist ideology that declared that \"the personal is political\" and \"sisterhood is powerful\"—formulations that arose from these consciousness-raising sessions.\n\nWithin the year, women's liberation groups sprang up all over America. In 1968, the first American national gathering of women's liberation activists was held in Lake Villa, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. That same year, at the University of Washington, a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) organizer reflected on a meeting about white college men working with poor white men, and \"noted that sometimes after analyzing societal ills, the men shared leisure time by 'balling a chick together.' He pointed out that such activities did much to enhance the political consciousness of poor white youth. A woman in the audience asked, 'And what did it do for the consciousness of the chick?'\" After the meeting, a handful of women formed Seattle's first women's liberation group. In June 1968, \"Notes from the First Year\", containing essays, speeches and transcripts of consciousness-raising sessions was distributed by the NYRW. The mimeographed booklet, which covered topics on sex, including abortion and orgasm, became the \"most circulated source material on the New York women's liberation movement\".\n\nLiberationists gained nationwide attention when they protested the Miss America Beauty Pageant on 7 September 1968. Though cameramen were prohibited from showing the protesters on television, newspapers headlined the story the following day. Because the pageant promoted beauty as the ideal for measuring women's worth, NYRW activists targeted the iconic event. Gathering items they considered to be objects of female oppression, such as bras, curlers, typing textbooks and copies of \"Ladies' Home Journal\", among other items, the activists intended to set fire to the trash cans containing them. They were prohibited from doing so, but the myth of \"bra-burning\", led to liberationists being called \"bra-burners\". By 1969, NYRW had split into two factions—politicos and feminists, dividing over whether the oppressor of women was the political and economic system or whether it was patriarchy. Politicos, who were tired of being labeled as man-haters and who believed the capitalist system was the root of the problem, formed the Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H), which focused on achieving equality through leftist politics. Feminists, who remained committed to fighting sexism, formed the Redstockings.\n\nThe split did not slow activity down. W.I.T.C.H. protested the 1969 Miss American Pageant and the Redstockings demonstrated at a hearing of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee considering a reform of abortion law. Angered that of the 15 experts called, 14 were men, the group held their own \"public hearings\" at the Washington Square Methodist Episcopal Church, allowing only women to \"testify\". By 1969, Women's Liberation was being featured in national magazines, like \"Life\", \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\". Vernita Gray, along with Michelle Brody, E. Kitch Child, Margaret E. Sloan and other women formed a group called the Women's Caucus of the Chicago Gay Liberation in 1969. Within a year, the multi-racial group, renamed the Chicago Lesbian Liberation (CLL), had established regular consciousness-raising events, known as \"Monday Night Meetings\". That same year, at a NOW meeting, Friedan, who feared feminists being associated with lesbians, referred to lesbian activists within the movement as the \"lavender menace\". Subsequently, Susan Brownmiller wrote an article for \"The New York Times Magazine\" describing the perceived threat to the movement. Lesbian activists responded by embracing the term, staging a protest at the Second Congress to Unite Women held in 1970, in which they revealed lavender t-shirts emblazoned with the term. Groups such as Columbia Women's Liberation, Daughters of Bilitis (which was a member of NOW) and RadicaLesbian pushed the drive for women to gain autonomy.\n\n1969 was a pivotal year, in that it marked the beginning of mainstream incorporation of the liberationsists' focus on sexism. Gloria Steinem, a member of NOW, wrote an article for \"New York\" magazine, \"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\", which was recognized with the Penney-Missouri Journalism Award as one of the first treatments of the women's movement. The \"Female Liberation Newsletter\", was founded that same year by Julie Morse and Rosina Richter in Minnesota, with the intent of centralizing publications on the varying views of the movement in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metro area. By 1970, they had formed the Amazon Bookstore Cooperative, hoping to provide a physical space for women-centered dialogue. Influential texts written by liberationists and published in 1970 included \"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\" by Anne Koedt, \"The Political Economy of Women's Liberation\" by Margaret Benston, \"The Politics of Housework\" by Pat Mainardi, \"Sexual Politics\" by Kate Millett, and \"Sisterhood Is Powerful, An Anthology of Writings from the Women's Liberation Movement\" edited by Robin Morgan By early 1970, \"Women's Lib\" was featured as a cover story in \"Saturday Review\" written by Lucy Komisar, vice president of NOW. \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"Mademoiselle\" devoted sections to the subject, some of which were written by feminists. Brownmiller, a member of New York Radical Feminists, wrote one of the articles in the February \"Mademoiselle\" issue and followed it up with an article in March, published in the \"New York Times Magazine\". Network news followed print media in a rush to cover the \"story of the year\".\n\nCBS was the first major network to cover women's liberation when it aired coverage on 15 January 1970 of the D.C. Women's Liberation group's disruption of Senate hearings on birth control as a small item in their broadcast. Within a week, the women's protests became leading stories on both CBS and ABC. Early stories focused on behavior, rather than motivations, but NBC broke with the tradition when it aired a story on 23 January evaluating the underlying causes of concern were that the side-effects of the pill had not disclosed safety hazards. In March, CBS televised a series, with all-male correspondents, focused on radicals in the feminist movement, highlighting liberationists' tactics, rather than their underlying issues and portraying sexism as an unsubstantiated claim, which should be treated with skepticism. It was followed by a 6-part series broadcast by NBC anchored by four women, who presented an analysis of the issues with sexual discrimination portrayed as a reality in women's lives. These various treatments, served to undermine the radical message, as on the one hand they were portrayed as extremists and on the other, their sexual politics were assimilated into the mainstream liberal feminist view to present a unified vision for women's equality. In May Marlene Sanders, a member of NOW and one of the two women journalists working for ABC at the time, produced a documentary on the WLM for ABC. The timing of her report was calculated, to curtail the view of advocacy, as it had been approved in 1969, but it did not air until other media outlets had covered the topic, paving the way for an objective presentation. Sander's production attempted to add legitimacy to women’s claims and shed a homogenized evaluation of the movement, \"edging lesbians, women of color and the movement's most radical\" elements out of the portrait. By redefining the movement, Sanders attempted to legitimize the need for social justice and present the demands of women as socially acceptable goals.\n\nThe media coverage brought forth one of the problems of the WLM's loose organizational structure. Though thousands of organizations had formed in the 1960s and 1970s and there were chapters from coast to coast and throughout the Heartland, finding an organization to join was difficult for many. Unable to locate organizations in the phonebook, many felt that the movement was invisible, while still others embraced the ideals without actually joining formal institutions. There were few public spaces where unattended women could gather freely and urban settings with racially segregated spaces were ingrained in the culture. The problem of finding spaces to meet was compounded by the practice of denying women credit without men's consent, thus renting a visible meeting place for women to come together was complicated, forcing women to gather in unconventional settings. For example, the Chicago Lesbian Liberation solved their meeting problems by gathering on a \"slow night\" at a local bar known as King's Ransom, which welcomed their multi-racial composition. The proprietor was happy for the business and ladies night became a regular feature of the establishment. Women's centers began to be created all over the country as a place for women to meet outside the home. Most of them were run as collectives and spaces for consciousness-raising groups to meet in a non-competitive environment, where women could discuss the intersection of their personal lives, as well as politics and the economy. By 1972, the New York Radical Feminist had prepared a set of instructions for developing consciousness-raising groups. The analysis that went on in these sessions was not therapeutic, but instead an evaluation of how one's personal experience had been shaped by cultural norms. \"Meetings were designed to turn the personal into the political\", by making women aware that the personal experiences were not unique and had social constructs.\n\nIt soon became apparent that small groups and loose cooperative organization was effective for building awareness, but to turn awareness into action more efficient structures were required. For example, the Crenshaw Women's Center in Los Angeles initially opened in 1970 with participants bringing their own pillows as seats. Eventually they collected second-hand furniture and developed a playground, assuming that their evening functions would be attended by women with children. Nine groups—“Haymarket Liberation, the New Adult Community of Women, NOW, Socialist Women’s Organizing Project, the Union of Women’s International Liberation, the Venice-Santa Monica Women’s Liberation, Women’s Liberation Front—UCLA, Women’s Liberation One and Working Women's Group”—came together to offer services to some 1500 women. They offered abortion and contraceptive counseling; personal and vocational consultations; ran a suicide hotline; published a monthly newsletter, \"The Women’s Center News\"; maintained a library of feminist writings; provided lectures on legal rights; and taught courses on self-defense. Following their ideal that new structures were needed to build women-only spaces, the center was open to all women and their children. Within a year, NOW withdrew from the collective and established an almost identical center which was open only to their members and invited guests, which included men.\n\nBy 1973, with the oil crisis and in reaction to 1960s radicalism, the US environment became more politically conservative. Combined with economic stagflation, radicalism lost favor. The fragile solidarity which had existed between various WLM groups began to fracture as the movement had developed no mechanism for political action other than direct confrontation. Though leftist, they did not adhere to any specific political alignment. The drive to create women-only spaces eliminated the need to confront sexism, as it allowed women to simply evade patriarchal organizations. Thus, rather than rendering gender irrelevant, for which liberationists argued, the cultural feminists, who evolved from them, created a counter-cultural movement to celebrate female difference. For example, \"Ms.\" began publication in 1972 co-opting the radicals' ideas of women's oppression and personal introspection, but blamed systemic causes for the issues, rather than men, and promoted self-improvement as a means to change women's lives, rather than politicization. Other groups embracing the idea of a utopian society composed solely of women were inspired by Jill Johnston's 1973 publication of \"Lesbian Nation\". Johnston promoted the idea of a complete break from men and patriarchal institutions arguing for women's separatism. Believing that lesbianism was a political stance, she argued that regardless of who they slept with, whether they knew it or not, \"all women were lesbians\".\n\nIn 1974, the Combahee River Collective was founded in Boston by twins Barbara and Beverly Smith, and former Black Panther activist Demita Frazier. Formed as a consciousness-raising group for lesbian feminists, it soon attracted members including Akasha Gloria Hull and Audre Lorde and began hosting retreats across the Northeastern United States. At the retreats intersectionality and overlapping identities were explored. The group continued meeting through 1980. By 1975, the Women's Liberation Movement had become simply the women's movement with liberals, who were pursuing reformist cultural feminism prevailing as the dominant group. Radical groups became marginalized and those that did not support the reformist climate splintered. However, in the short history of the WLM the movement exploded into a world-wide awareness of sexism and pushed the liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims.\n\nThe first group affiliated with the ideas of the Women's Liberation Movement in Mexico was the \"Mujeres en Acción Solidaria\" (Women Acting in Solidarity, MAS) formed informally in Mexico City in 1970. The student movement and women's movement in the United States called into question not just needed educational reforms and social imbalances, but led to the realization that the political system and the structures of power were authoritarian and coercive and needed restructuring. Initially members of MAS met informally to question the roles of women in Mexican society. In April 1971, Magdalena Zapián attempted to get a permit for a protest to be held at the Monument to the Mother, but was denied permission. Deciding to go ahead with the demonstration, MAS' first public action was to hold a protest on Mother's Day 1971 to question why motherhood was required for all women.\n\nAt regular consciousness-raising sessions, the women met to discuss collective solutions to politicize their personal issues. That same year, Susan Sontag gave a presentation on feminism at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and so many women began wanting to participate that the group split into a north and south group. Their ideas spread in 1972 after publication of an article \"La situación de la mujer en México\" (The Situation of Women in Mexico) was published in the magazine \"Punto Crítico\" and members began organizing events at universities in Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Jalapa, Morelia, San Luis Potosí, and Zacatecas, to discuss topics like child care centers, employment inequality, and reproductive rights. By 1973, the group was known throughout Mexico and hosted conferences at UNAM on abortion, sexuality, feminism and politics, as well as other topics. They also established a day care center, where meetings could be held, but increasingly the diverse points of view fractured MAS.\n\nIn February 1974 a group of former MAS members split off and formed the \"Movimiento de Liberación de la Mujer\" (MLM). The more radical members of the MAS did not join MLM, which incorporated class struggles with the struggle against sexism. To expand their membership, they wanted to embrace a wider definition of women's issues, but in effect, it had the opposite effect, as small interest groups formed in the new organization focusing on specific goals. The small interest groups worked collectively on issues like abortion and a plan to host a counter-conference during the World Conference on Women hosted by Mexico in 1975. The planning of the conference again the official UN conference created discord, and yet another split occurred, when a group of women split off to form the \"Colectivo La Revuelta\" (Collective Revolt) with the purpose of establishing a magazine to disseminate their ideas on the movement. The remaining members of the MLM continued to change and evolve, with groups splitting off such as the \"Movimiento Feminista Mexicano (Movement of Mexican Feminists, MFM)\", which in 1976 became the main members of the \"Coalición de Mujeres Feministas (Coalition of Feminist Women, CMF)\" The CMF focused mainly on voluntary maternity and violence against women and began to establish women's shelters. The \"Lucha Feminista\" (Feminist Struggle), which formed in 1978, reformed into the \"Frente Nacional por los Derechos y la Liberación de las Mujeres\" (National Front for the\nRights and the Liberation of Women, FNALIDM) in 1980, but it would dissolve a year after formation. That same year, the remaining MLM members formed the \"Colectivo de Acción Solidaria con Empleadas Domésticas\" (Collective of Solidarity Action with Domestic Employees,\nCASED), to support women working as housekeepers.\n\nThe \"Colectivo\" began publishing in 1977, a journal titled with the same name as their group to discuss the topics ranging from abortion to domestic obligation and including rape, sexuality, and prostitution. They were the most radical group which formed in Mexico, supporting separation from hierarchical structures, such as political parties and unions, and even other feminist groups. After publishing nine issues of \"Colectivo La Revuelta\" they started a newspaper with the name \"UnomásLlno\" (One plus one) in 1980, disseminating ideas about women's autonomy and living collectively with other women. In 1983, the group dissolved after their publication of \"Revuelta, reflexiones, testimonios y reportajes de Mujeres en México, 1975–1983\" (Revolt, reflections, testimonies\nand stories of women in Mexico, 1975–1983), which gave the history of the group and summary of their objectives.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the dominant feminists in Mexico had become the \"Movimiento Nacional de Mujeres\" (National Movement of Women, MNM), which had been founded in 1973 following the model of the United States' organization National Organization for Women. Like its US counterpart, the MNM were mainly middle-class women who were interested in reforming existing civil codes as a means to attain women's equality.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3885057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3885057", "title": "Writing process", "text": "Writing process\n\nThe writing process is the series of actions required to produce a coherent written text. It is a key term in the teaching of writing.\n\nIn 1972, Donald M. Murray published a brief manifesto titled \"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product\", a phrase which became a rallying cry for many writing teachers. Ten years later, in 1982, Maxine Hairston argued that the teaching of writing had undergone a \"paradigm shift\" in moving from a focus on written products to writing processes.\n\nFor many years, it was assumed that the writing process generally operated in some variation of three to five \"stages\"; the configuration below is typical:\n\n\nWhat is now called \"post-process\" research demonstrates that it is seldom accurate to describe these \"stages\" as fixed steps in a straightforward process. Rather, they are more accurately conceptualized as overlapping parts of a complex whole or parts of a recursive process that are repeated multiple times throughout the writing process. Thus writers routinely discover that, for instance, editorial changes trigger brainstorming and a change of purpose; that drafting is temporarily interrupted to correct a misspelling; or that the boundary between prewriting and drafting is less than obvious.\n\nFlower and Hayes extend Bitzer's rhetorical situation to become a series of rhetorical problems, i.e., when a writer must represent the situation as a problem to be solved, such as the invocation of a particular audience to an oversimplified approach such as finding a theme and completing the writing in two pages by Monday's class.\n\nIn \"The Cognition of Discovery\" Flower and Hayes set out to discover the differences between good and bad writers. They came to three results from their study, which suggests that good writers envelop the three following characteristics when solving their rhetorical problems:\n\n\nFlower and Hayes suggest that composition instructors need to consider showing students how \"to explore and define their own problems, even within the constraints of an assignment\". They believe that \"Writers discover what they want to do by insistently, energetically exploring the entire problem before them and building for themselves a unique image of the problem they want to solve.\"\n\nPatricia Bizzell argues that even though educators may have an understanding of \"how\" the writing process occurs, educators shouldn't assume that this knowledge can answer the question \"about 'why' the writer makes certain choices in certain situations\", since writing is always situated within a discourse community (484). She discusses how the Flower and Hayes model relies on what is called the process of \"translating ideas into visible language\" (486). This process occurs when students \"treat written English as a set of containers into which we pour meaning\" (486). Bizzell contends that this process \"remains the emptiest box\" in the cognitive process model, since it de-contextualizes the original context of the written text, negating the original. She argues that \"Writing does not so much contribute to thinking as provide an occasion for thinking...\"\n\n\"The aim of collaborative learning helps students to find more control in their learning situation. \n\nEven grammar has a social turn in writing: \"It may be that to fully account for the contempt that some errors of usage arouse, we will have to understand better than we do the relationship between language, order, and those deep psychic forces that perceived linguistic violations seem to arouse in otherwise amiable people\". \nSo one can't simply say a thing is right or wrong. There is a difference of degrees attributed by social forces.\n\nAccording to the expressivist theory, the process of writing is centered on the writer's transformation. This involves the writer changing in the sense that voice and identity are established and the writer has a sense of his or her self. This theory became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Richard Fulkerson's article \"Four Philosophies of Composition\", the focus of expressivism is for writers to have \"... an interesting, credible, honest, and personal voice\". Moreover, proponents of the expressivist process view this theory as a way for students to become fulfilled and healthy both emotionally and mentally. Those who teach this process often focus on journaling and other classroom activities to focus on student self-discovery and at times, low-stakes writing. Prominent figures in the field include John Dixon, Ken Macrorie, Lou Kelly, Donald C. Stewart and Peter Elbow.\n\nAn historical response to process is concerned primarily with the manner in which writing has been shaped and governed by historical and social forces. These forces are dynamic and contextual, and therefore render any static iteration of process unlikely.\n\nNotable scholars that have conducted this type of inquiry include media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong, Gregory Ulmer, and Cynthia Selfe. Much of McLuhan's work, for example, centered around the impact of written language on oral cultures, degrees to which various media are accessible and interactive, and the ways in which electronic media determine communication patterns. His evaluation of technology as a shaper of human societies and psyches indicates a strong connection between historical forces and literacy practices.\n\nAs appealing as document sharing may be for students with autism in particular, being able to contextualize one's life story in the context of their disability may prove the most powerful expression of the writing process overall. Rose illustrates that creating narrative identity in a conventional sense is quite difficult for autistic students because of their challenges with interpersonal communication. The narratives of autistic students can sometimes be troubling to neurotypical peers with whom they share their work, as Rose notes in quoting autistic autobiographer Dawn Price-Hughes, \"Sometimes reaching out and communicating isn’t easy–it can bring sadness and regret. Some of my family and friends, after reading the manuscript for this book, were deeply saddened to learn how I experienced my world.\"\n\nRose points to the well-known work of Temple Grandin and Donna Williams as examples of autistic autobiographies and analogizes toward the usefulness of women's autobiographies championed by Susan Stanford Friedman to show women's inter-connectivity, suggesting the same can be learned through autistic autobiographies. She writes that such works can minimize the \"pathologisation of difference\" which can easily occur between autistic students and neuroytpical peers can be broken down by such autobiographies. As Rose directly says, \"I argue here that awareness of the relationality of autistic life writing, and the recognition of its corollary status as testimonio and attention to the material relations of the production of these texts is particularly useful in assessing their social significance.\"\n\nFrom a rhetorical perspective the use for students with disabilities (not just autistic students) seems to be promising. It would appear to foster a sense of a community among students with disabilities and helping these voices be brought in from the margins similarly to the way Mike Rose refers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their needs in \"Lives on the Boundary\".\n\nEditing operates on several levels. The lowest level, often called line editing, is the stage in the writing process where the writer makes changes in the text to correct errors—such as spelling, subject/verb agreement, verb tense consistency, point of view consistency, mechanical errors, word choice, and word usage (there, their or they're)—and fine-tune his or her style. Having revised the draft for content, the writer's task is now to make changes that will improve the communication with the reader. Depending on the genre, the writer may choose to adhere to the conventions of Standard English. These conventions are still being developed and the rulings on controversial issues may vary depending on the source. For example, Strunk and White's \"Elements of Style\", first published in 1918, is considered by some to be an authority on stylistic conventions, but has been derided by linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum as \"stupid\". A more recent handbook for students is Diana Hacker's \"A Writer's Reference\". An electronic resource is the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL), where writers may search a specific issue to find an explanation of grammatical and mechanical conventions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "331452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331452", "title": "Yellow Peril", "text": "Yellow Peril\n\nThe Yellow Peril (also Yellow Terror and Yellow Spectre) is a racist color-metaphor that is integral to the xenophobic theory of colonialism: that the peoples of East Asia are a danger to the Western world. As a psycho-cultural perception of menace from the East, fear of the Yellow Peril was more racial than national, a fear derived, not from concern with a specific source of danger, from any one country or people, but from a vaguely ominous, existential fear of the vast, faceless, nameless horde of yellow people opposite the Western world. As a form of xenophobia, the Yellow Terror is the fear of the rising tide of colored people from the Orient.\n\nThe racist ideology of the Yellow Peril is a \"core imagery of apes, lesser men, primitives, children, madmen, and beings who possessed special powers\", which are cultural representations of colored people that originated in the Græco–Persian Wars (499–449 BC), between Ancient Greece and the Persian Empire; centuries later, Western imperialist expansion included East Asians to the Yellow Peril.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Russian sociologist Jacques Novikow coined the phrase in his essay \"Le Péril Jaune\" (\"The Yellow Peril\", 1897); later, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany used Yellow Peril racism to encourage the European empires to invade, conquer, and colonize China. To that end, the Kaiser misrepresented the Asian victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) as a racialist threat to the white citizens of Western Europe, and misrepresented China and Japan in alliance to conquer and subjugate the Western world.\n\nThe sinologist Wing-Fai Leung explained the fantastic origins of the phrase and racialist ideology: \"The phrase yellow peril (sometimes yellow terror or yellow spectre) ... blends Western anxieties about sex, racist fears of the alien other, and the Spenglerian belief that the West will become outnumbered and enslaved by the East.\"\n\nThe academic Gina Marchetti identified the psycho-cultural fear of Asians as \"rooted in medieval fears of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian invasions of Europe, the Yellow Peril combines racist terror of alien cultures, sexual anxieties, and the belief that the West will be overpowered and enveloped, by the irresistible, dark, occult forces of the East\"; hence, in light of Japanese imperial militarism, the West included Japanese people to Yellow Peril racism.\n\nThe racist and cultural stereotypes of the Yellow Peril originated in the late 19th century, when Chinese workers (people of different skin-color, physiognomy, language and culture) legally immigrated to Australia, Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand, where they inadvertently provoked a racist backlash against themselves, for agreeing to work for lower wages, than the local white populations. In 1870, the French Orientalist and historian Ernest Renan had warned Europeans of Eastern danger to the West, yet Renan had meant the Russian Empire (1721–1917), a nation whom the West perceived as more Asiatic than European.\n\nSince 1870, in the practise of colonial imperialism, the stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology gave concrete form to the anti-Asian racism that was cultural-currency in the Western worldview of Europe and North America. In central Europe, the Orientalist and diplomat Max von Brandt advised Kaiser Wilhelm II that Imperial Germany had colonial interests to pursue in China. Hence, the Kaiser used the phrase \"die Gelbe Gefahr\" (The Yellow Peril) to specifically encourage Imperial German interests and justify European colonialism in China.\n\nIn 1895, Germany, France, and Russia staged the Triple Intervention to the Treaty of Shimonoseki (17 April 1895), which concluded the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), in order to compel Imperial Japan to surrender their Chinese colonies to the Europeans; that geopolitical gambit became an underlying \"casus belli\" of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). The Kaiser justified the Triple Intervention to the Japanese empire with racialist calls-to-arms against non-existent geopolitical dangers of the \"yellow race\" against the \"white race\" of Western Europe.\n\nTo justify European cultural hegemony, the Kaiser used the allegorical lithograph \"Peoples of Europe, Guard Your Most Sacred Possessions\" (1895), by Hermann Knackfuss, to communicate his geopolitics to other European monarchs. The lithograph depicts Germany as the leader of Europe, – collectively personified as \"prehistoric warrior-goddesses being led by the Archangel Michael against the 'yellow peril' from the East\" represented by \"dark cloud of smoke [upon] which rests an eerily calm Buddha, wreathed in flame\" (described by British historian James Palmer). Politically, the Knackfuss lithograph allowed Kaiser Wilhelm II to believe he prophesied the imminent race war that would decide global hegemony in the 20th century.\n\nIn the late 19th century, with the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) China recovered the eastern portion of the Ili River basin (Zhetysu), which Russia had occupied for a decade, since the Dungan Revolt (1862–77). In that time, the mass communications media of the West misrepresented China as an ascendant military power, and applied Yellow Peril ideology to evoke racist fears that China would conquer Western colonies, such as Australia.\n\nIn 1870s California, despite the Burlingame Treaty (1868) that allowed legal migration of unskilled labourers from China, the native working-class white people demanded that the U.S government cease the immigration of \"filthy yellow hordes\" of Chinese people who took jobs from native-born white-Americans, especially during an economic depression. In that vein, Horace Greeley, editor of the \"New-York Tribune\" newspaper, wrote a xenophobic and racist editorial opinion supporting the popularly demanded exclusion:\n\nIn Los Angeles, Yellow Peril racism provoked the Chinese Massacre of 1871, wherein 500 white men lynched 20 Chinese men in the Chinatown ghetto. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the leader of the Workingmen's Party of California, the Irish-born Denis Kearney was an extraordinary demagogue who successfully applied Yellow Peril ideology to his politics against the press, capitalists, politicians, and Chinese workers, and concluded his speeches with the epilogue: \"and whatever happens, the Chinese must go!\" Hence, by 1882, the political pressure of white xenophobia (nativist and populist) compelled the U.S. government to legislate the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), which remained the effective immigration-law until 1943.\n\nIn 1900, the anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion (August 1899 – September 1901) reinforced the racist stereotypes of Asian people as a Yellow Peril to white people. The Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists (the Boxers) was a xenophobic martial-arts organization who blamed the problems of China on the presence of Western colonies in China proper. The Boxers sought to save China by killing every Western colonist and Chinese Christian – Westernized Chinese people. In early summer of 1900, Prince Zaiyi allowed the Boxers into Beijing, to kill Western colonists and Chinese Christians, in siege to the foreign legations. Afterwards, Ronglu, Qing Commander-in-Chief, and Yikuang, Prince Qing, resisted and expelled the Boxers from Beijing after days of fighting.\n\nMost of the victims of the Boxer Rebellion were Chinese Christians, but the massacres of Chinese people were of no interest to the West, who demanded Asian blood to avenge the Western colonists killed by rebellious Chinese natives. In response, Great Britain, the U.S., Imperial Japan, France, Imperial Russia, Imperial Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy formed the Eight-Nation Alliance, and despatched an international military expeditionary force to end the Siege of the International Legations in Beijing.\n\nIn the Russian press, Yellow Peril ideology misrepresented anti-colonial revolt (the Boxer Rebellion) in racialist and religious terms: A cultural war between White Holy Russia and Yellow Pagan China. The press further supported the Yellow Peril apocalypse with quotations from the Sinophobic poems of the philosopher Vladimir Solovyov. Likewise in the press, the aristocracy demanded action against the Asian threat; Prince Sergei Nikolaevich Trubetskoy urged Imperial Russia and other European monarchies to jointly partition China, and end the Yellow Peril to Christendom. Hence, on 3 July 1900, in response to the Boxer Rebellion, Russia expelled the Chinese community (5,000 people) from Blagoveshchensk; then, during the 4–8 July period, the Tsarist police, Cossack cavalry, and local vigilantes killed the expelled Chinese at the Amur River.\n\nIn the West, news of Boxer atrocities against Western colonists stirred anti-Asian racism in Europe and North America, where that anti-colonial revolt was mis-perceived as a race war, between the yellow race and the white race. Historically, Yellow Peril ideology recycles Boxer-Rebellion atrocities as false-proof that \"Boxerism\" (innate, murderous hatred of Westerners) is a Chinese cultural trait. In that vein, the article \"A Righteous Fist\" (\"The Economist\", 1905) warned the Western reader that: The history of the Boxer movement contains abundant warnings, as to the necessity of an attitude of constant vigilance, on the part of the European Powers, when there are any symptoms that a wave of nationalism is about to sweep over the Celestial Empire.\n\nHence, 61 years later, in 1967, during the Cultural Revolution, when the Red Guard attacked the British Embassy and beat diplomats, to the home country, the embassy staff explained the political violence as an outbreak of \"Boxerism\", which is an innate, cultural characteristic of the Chinese people.\n\nOn 27 July 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II gave the racist \"Hunnenrede\" (Hun speech) exhorting his soldiers to barbarism; that Imperial German soldiers depart Europe for China and suppress the Boxer Rebellion, by acting like \"Huns\" and committing atrocities against the Chinese (Boxer and civilian):\n\nFearful of harm to the public image of Imperial Germany, the \"Auswärtiges Amt\" (Foreign Office) published a redacted version of the Hun Speech, expurgated of the exhortation to racist barbarism. Annoyed by Foreign-Office censorship, the Kaiser published the unexpurgated Hun Speech, which \"evoked images of a Crusade and considered the current crisis [the Boxer Rebellion] to amount to a war between Occident and Orient.\" Yet that \"elaborate accompanying music, and the new ideology of the Yellow Peril stood in no relation to the actual possibilities and results\" of geopolitical policy based upon racist misperception.\n\nThe Kaiser ordered the expedition-commander, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee, to behave barbarously, because the Chinese were, \"by nature, cowardly, like a dog, but also deceitful.\" In that time, the Kaiser's best friend, Prince Philip von Euenburg wrote to another friend that the Kaiser wanted to raze Beijing, and kill the populace to avenge the murder of Baron Clemens von Ketteler, Imperial Germany's minister to China. Only the Eight-Nation Alliance's refusal of barbarism to resolve the siege of the legations, saved the Chinese populace of Beijing from the massacre recommended by Imperial Germany. In August 1900, an international military-force of Russian, Japanese, British, French, and American soldiers captured Beijing, before the German force arrived to the city.\n\nThe Eight-Nation Alliance sacked Beijing in vengeance for the Boxer Rebellion; the magnitude of the rape, pillaging, and burning indicated \"a sense that the Chinese were less than human\" to the Western militaries. About the sacking of the city, an Australian colonist said: \"The future of the Chinese is a fearful problem. Look at the frightful sights one sees in the streets of Peking. . . . See the filthy, tattered rags they wrap around them. Smell them as they pass. Hear of their nameless immorality. Witness their shameless indecency, and picture them among your own people – Ugh! It makes you shudder!\"\n\nBritish admiral Roger Keyes recalled that: \"Every Chinaman . . . was treated as a Boxer, by the Russian and French troops, and the slaughter of men, women, and children in retaliation was revolting\". The American colonist Luella Miner reported that \"the conduct of the Russian soldiers is \"atrocious\", the French are not much better, and the Japanese are looting and burning without mercy. Women and girls, by the hundreds, have committed suicide to escape a worse fate at the hands of Russian and Japanese brutes.\"\n\nBritish soldiers threatened to kill a Chinese old man, unless he gave them his treasure. On learning he had no treasure, a rifleman prepared to bayonet the old man dead. That rifleman was stopped by another soldier, who told him: \"No, not that way! I'm going to shoot him. I've always had a longing to see what sort of wound a dum-dum [bullet] will make, and by Christ, I am going to try one on this blasted Chink!\" After shooting the Chinese old man in the face, the British soldier exclaimed: \"Christ, the dum-dum has blown the back out of his bloody nut!\" Moreover, the British journalist George Lynch said, \"there are things that I must not write, and that may not be printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery\".\n\nThe German expedition of Field Marshal Waldersee arrived in China on 27 September 1900, after the military defeat of the Boxer Rebellion by the Eight Nation Alliance; yet he launched 75 punitive raids into northern China to search for and destroy the remaining Boxers. The punitive German soldiers killed more peasants than Boxer guerrillas, because, by autumn 1900, the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists posed no threat, military or political. On 19 November 1900, the Kaiser's military gambit in China was criticized as shameful to Germany; in the \"Reichstag\", the German Social Democrat politician August Bebel criticized the imperial war against the Boxers:\n\nThe political praxis of Yellow Peril racism features a call for apolitical racial-unity among white people. To resolve a contemporary problem (economic, social, political) the racialist politician calls for white unity against the non-white Other who threatens from Asia. Despite their military defeat of the anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion, in the Western world, white racial-fear of Chinese nationalism became established as a cultural fear: That the Chinese race mean to invade, vanquish, and subjugate the Christian civilisation of the Western world.\n\nIn July 1900, the \"Völkisch\" movement intellectual Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the \"Evangelist of Race\", gave his racialist perspective of the cultural meaning of the Boer War (1899–1902) in relation to the Boxer Rebellion: \"One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other, for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men, and threatens destruction.\"\n\nThe Yellow Peril racialism of the Austrian philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels (a founder of Gestalt psychology) proposed that the West and the East were in a Darwinian racial struggle for world domination, which the yellow race was winning. That monogamy was a legalistic hindrance to global white-supremacy, for limiting a genetically superior white man to father children with only one woman; that in polygamy, the yellow race had greater reproductive advantage, for permitting a genetically superior Asian man to father children with many women.\n\nEhrenfels dismissed the Chinese as a racially inferior people whose Oriental culture lacked \"all potentialities . . . determination, initiative, productivity, invention, and organizational talent\" innate to the white culture of the Western world. Contradictorily, despite having essentialized the Chinese into a listless mass of mindless Asians, Ehrenfels praised Japan as a first-rate military power, whose inevitable conquest of China would improve the racial breeds native to China. That through selective breeding with \"genetically superior\" Chinese women, the Japanese would create a race of \"healthy, sly, cunning coolies\", because the Chinese are virtuosos of sexual reproduction. The essence of Ehrenfels's nihilistic racism was that Asian conquest of the West equalled racial annihilation. Europe invaded, conquered, and subjugated by a Sino–Japanese army of genetically superior soldiers in a race war that the Western powers (imperial and democratic) would be unable to thwart or win.\n\nTo resolve the demographic imbalance between the East and the West, Ehrenfels proposed politically radical changes to the structures of European society, such as State control of human sexuality, by way of polygamy, which would ensure the procreation of a numerically and genetically superior nation of white people. Only white men of high economic and genetic status would legally be allowed to father children. Despite such radical changes to male sexual mores, women remained monogamous by law, culturally limited to the wife-and-mother social identity established in monogamous Christian patriarchy.\n\nIn Ehrenfels's polygamous patriarchy, women reside in communal barracks, where they collectively rear children. The State assigns each woman a husband for conjugal visits, solely for reproductive sexual-intercourse. The number of wives that a white man might have is determined by his socio-economic status, hence ensuring that only the \"social winners\" can transmit and perpetuate their genes. In such a white-supremacist society the man-and-woman relationship is reduced to the function of reproduction; romantic love is divorced from sexual intercourse in service to male white-supremacy.\n\nTo end the Yellow Peril, Ehrenfels proposed that the white nations of the world unite to conquer the nations of Asia, before it became infeasible, in order to create a new racial order for the world, which would feature an hereditary caste system headed by white people. Worldwide, an Aryan oligarchy (white people) would form and populate the ruling castes of the military and of the intelligentsia status-class, whilst the yellow-skin and the black-skin races would occupy the slave castes of their respective societies.\n\nEhrenfels believed that the racially pure society he proposed would be realised in the far-future, because \"the Aryan will only respond to the imperative of sexual reform when the waves of the Mongolian tide are lapping around his neck\". In light of the Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Ehrenfels said that such an Asian victory indicated \"the absolute necessity of a radical sexual reform for the continued existence of the Western races of man . . . [the matter] has been raised from the level of discussion to the level of a scientifically proven fact\".\n\nIn \"Sex, Masculinity, and the 'Yellow Peril': Christian von Ehrenfels' Program for a Revision of the European Sexual Order, 1902–1910\" (2002), the historian Edward Ross Dickinson said that Ehrenfels always used metaphors of deadly water to express his racism and fear of the Yellow Peril: A \"flood\" of Chinese upon the West; a Chinese \"torrent of mud\" drowning Europe; the Japanese as a \"polluting liquid\"; and that white Europeans would not respond to such a racial menace until the \"waves\" of Asians reached the neck.\n\nLikewise, the historian Klaus Theweleit said that, in the interwar period (1918–39), the political and racialist writings of the \"Freikorps\", right-wing mercenaries, featured imagery of deadly water, in a time when \"the Jews\" and the Communists were the only political and cultural threats to the worldview of right-wing Europeans. That the right-wing \"Freikorps\" were psychologically insecure men obsessed with masculinity, and with proving themselves hard men; the negative imagery of water they used, reflected fears of the physical softness of women; of the erotic; of love and emotional intimacy; and of human dependence – things that psychologically threatened to render them less manly.\n\nMoreover, Dickinson said that a man like Baron Christian von Ehrenfels likely suffered the same sexual anxieties about masculinity, as did the right-wing writers, whose works Theweleit examined, but that only Ehrenfels projected his sexual insecurity into Yellow Peril racism, rather than the usual anti-Semitic myth of Judeo-Bolshevism, which is a racist prejudice more common to German culture.\n\nFrom 1895, the Kaiser's government used Yellow Peril ideology to portray Imperial Germany as defender of the West against conquest from the East. In pursuit of \"Weltpolitik\", the world policy to establish Germany as the dominant world power, the Kaiser manipulated public opinion, the government and other monarchs. In a letter to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhem II wrote: \"It is clearly the great task of the future for Russia to cultivate the Asian continent, and defend Europe from the inroads of the Great Yellow Race\". In \"The Bloody White Baron\" (2009), the historian James Palmer explains the sociocultural background of 19th-century Europe in which Yellow Peril ideology originated and flourished:\n\nAs his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm knew that Tsar Nicholas shared his anti-Asian racism and believed he could persuade the Tsar to abrogate the Franco-Russian Alliance (1894) and then to form a German–Russian alliance against Britain. In manipulative pursuit of Imperial German \"Weltpolitik\" \"Wilhelm II's deliberate use of the 'yellow peril' slogan was more than a personal idiosyncrasy, and fitted into the general pattern of German foreign policy under his reign, i.e. to encourage Russia's Far Eastern adventures, and later to sow discord, between the United States and Japan. Not the substance, but only the form, of Wilhelm II's 'yellow peril' propaganda disturbed the official policy of the Wilhelmstrasse.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, the racial and cultural stereotypes of Yellow Peril ideology colored German perceptions of Russia as a nation more Asiatic that European. The European folk memory of the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe made the word \"Mongol\" a cultural synonym for the \"Asian culture of cruelty and insatiable appetite for conquest\", which was especially personified by Genghis Khan, leader of the Orda, the Mongol Horde.\n\nDespite that justifying historical background, Yellow Peril racism was not universally accepted in the societies of Europe. French intellectual Anatole France said that Yellow Peril ideology was to be expected from a racist man such as the Kaiser. Inverting the racist premise of Asian invasion, France showed that European imperialism in Asia and Africa indicated that the European White Peril was the true threat to the world. In his essay \"The Bogey of the Yellow Peril\" (1904), the British journalist Demetrius Charles Boulger said the Yellow Peril was racist hysteria for popular consumption. Asian geopolitical dominance of the world is \"the prospect, placed before the uninstructed reading public, is a revival of the Hun and Mongol terrors, and the names of Attila and Genghis are set out in the largest type to create feelings of apprehension. The reader is assured, in the most positive manner, that this is the doing of the enterprising nation of Japan\". Throughout the successful imperial intrigues facilitated by Germany's Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser's true geopolitical target was Britain.\n\nIn 18th-century Britain, the Chinese were considered a civilised people, but British imperial expansion in the 19th century facilitated racialist hostility towards Asians. The Chinese people were stereotyped as an inherently-depraved and corrupt people. Still, there were exceptions to popular racism of the Yellow Peril. In May 1890, William Ewart Gladstone criticized anti–Chinese immigration laws in Australia for penalizing their hard worker virtues (diligence, thrift and integrity), instead of penalizing their vices (gambling and opium-smoking).\n\nIn 1904, in a meeting about the Russian–Japanese War, King Edward VII heard the Kaiser complain that the Yellow Peril is \"the greatest peril menacing... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen\". Undiplomatically, the Kaiser criticised the British for siding with Japan against Russia, suggesting \"race treason\" as a motive. In reply to the Kaiser, King Edward said he \"could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".\nThe first British usage of the Yellow Peril phrase was in the \"Daily News\" (21 July 1900) report describing the Boxer Rebellion as \"the yellow peril in its most serious form\". Then, the racism of British Sinophobia, the fear of Chinese people, did not include all Asians since Britain had sided with Japan during the Russian–Japanese War, but France and Germany supported Russia. The reports of one British military observer, Captain William Pakenham \"tended to depict Russia as his enemy, not just Japan\".\n\nAbout pervasive Sinophobia in Western culture, in \"The Yellow Peril: Dr Fu Manchu & the Rise of Chinaphobia\" (2014), historian Julia Lovell noted:\n\nIn the British popular imagination, the Limehouse district of London was a centre of depravity and vice, sexual prostitution, opium smoking and gambling. The press warned of the dangers of miscegenation of Chinese men marrying British women as a racial threat to Britain, and it warned that Triad gangsters kidnapped British women into white slavery, \"a fate worse than death\" in Western popular culture. In 1914, at the start of the First World War, the Defence of the Realm Act was amended to include the smoking of opium as grounds for deportation. In fact, that was a legalistic pretext for expelling the Chinese inhabitants of London from Britain proper. That anti–Chinese moral panic derived from the social reality that British women had acquired economic independence with war effort jobs and would engage in premarital sexual affairs, a cultural threat that offended Britain's conservative society. Such racist fears of the Yellow Peril were European cultural prejudices projected onto the Chinese community of Britain for allegedly corrupting British women into premarital libertinism.\n\nIn the US, Yellow Peril xenophobia was legalized with the Page Act of 1875, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and the Geary Act of 1892. The Chinese Exclusion Act replaced the Burlingame Treaty (1868), which had encouraged Chinese migration to the US and provided that \"citizens of the United States in China, of every religious persuasion, and Chinese subjects, in the United States, shall enjoy entire liberty of conscience, and shall be exempt from all disability or persecution, on account of their religious faith or worship, in either country\", withholding only the right of naturalized citizenship.\n\nIn the Western US, the regular cultural lynching Chinese people yielded the coinage of a phrase, \"Having a Chinaman's chance in Hell\", meaning no chance at all. In 1880 Denver, the Yellow Peril pogrom featured a lynched Chinese man and destruction of the local Chinatown. In 1885, the Rock Springs massacre of 28 miners destroyed a Wyoming Chinese community. In Washington Territory, Yellow Peril fears realised the Attack on Squak Valley Chinese laborers, 1885; the arson of the Seattle Chinatown; and the Tacoma riot of 1885 by which local white folk expelled the Chinese community from their towns. In Seattle, the Knights of Labor expelled 200 Chinese people by the Seattle riot of 1886. In Oregon, 34 Chinese gold miners were ambushed, robbed and killed in the Hells Canyon Massacre (1887). Moreover, about being Chinese in the 19th-century US, in the essay \"A Chinese View of the Statue of Liberty\" (1885), Sauum Song Bo said,:\n\nUnder nativist political pressure, the Immigration Act of 1917 established an Asian Barred Zone of countries from which immigration to the US was forbidden. The Cable Act of 1922, or the Married Women's Independent Nationality Act, guaranteed citizenship to independent woman unless they married to an alien ineligible to naturalization. During the 1920s, when the Cable Act of 1922 was law, Asian men and women were excluded from American citizenship. In practice, the Cable Act of 1922 reversed some racial exclusion laws and granted independent-woman citizenship exclusively to women married to white men. Analogously, the Act allowed revocation of the US citizenship of a white woman married an Asian man. Nonetheless, legalized Yellow Peril racism was challenged; in the Supreme Court case of \"Takao Ozawa v. United States\" (1922), a Japanese–American man tried to demonstrate that the Japanese are a white race eligible for naturalized US citizenship, but the Court ruled that the Japanese are not white people. Two years later, the National Origins Quota of 1924 specifically excluded the Japanese from the country and citizenship.\n\nTo \"preserve the ideal of American homogeneity\", the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 (numeric limits) and the Immigration Act of 1924 (fewer Southern and Eastern Europeans) restricted admission according to immigrants' national origins. In practice, the Emergency Quota Act used an old census to determine the number of colored immigrants to admit to the US. Still, to protect the ethnic supremacy (social, economic and political) of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) community, the Immigration Act of 1924 used the census of 1890 (two decades old) because its 19th-century demographic-group percentages favoured more admissions of WASP immigrants and fewer admissions of colored immigrants from Asia, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.\n\nThe National Origins Formula (1921–1965) was meant to maintain the \"status quo\" percentages of colored ethnic populations in proportion to their existing populations. The National Origins Formula was to ensure that the immigration of colored peoples did not change the WASP national character of the US. To that end, the National Origins Formula allowed only 150,000 colored people to immigrate the US per year. Specifically inclining Latin Americans and excluding Asians, the law used Yellow Peril racism, which was institutionally inherent to US immigration law. It was much later that the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that repealed the racial quota systems.\n\nEugenics-supporters used the Yellow Peril to present the US as a WASP nation with an ethnically-pure country under threat of miscegenation by Asian immigration. They expressed with biological language (infection, disease, decay) and imagery of bodily penetration (wounds and sores) by the nonwhite Asian Other.\n\nIn \"The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident\" (1911), the end time evangelist G. G. Rupert, said that Russia would unite the colored races to facilitate the Oriental invasion, conquest and subjugation of the West. That was derived from the Christian eschatology of the Book of Revelation in verse 16:12: \"Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance\". Moreover, as an Old-Testament Christian, Rupert believed in the racialist doctrine of British Israelism and said that the Yellow Peril from China, India, Japan and Korea, were attacking Britain and the US but that Jesus would halt their conquest of the Western world.\n\nIn \"The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy\" (1920), the eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, said that either China or Japan would unite the colored peoples of Asia and lead them to destroy the white world of the West and that the colored conquest of the world began with the Asian victory in the Russian–Japanese War (1905). As a white supremacist, Stoddard presented his racialist theories with biblical vocabulary and catastrophic imagery depicting a rising tide of \"non-white\" people who mean to invade, conquer and subjugate the white race.\n\nIn that cultural vein, the phrase was commonly used editorially in the newspapers of publisher William Randolph Hearst. In the 1930s, Hearst newspapers realised a campaign of vilification (political and personal) against the American communist activist Elaine Black, whom he denounced as libertine \"Tiger Woman\" for openly cohabiting with Karl Yoneda, an Asian man and a communist. In 1931 California, interracial marriage was outlawed and so they could not marry, but in 1935, Black and Yoneda married in Seattle, Washington, a city and a state that did not proscribe interracial marriage. The vilification of Elaine Black was about miscegenation, not communist politics. Publisher Hearst's business acumen saw that reporting the socially-scandalous private life of a politically-active American white woman in an interracial relationship with an Asian man would sell more newspapers.\n\nIn the 1930s, Yellow Peril stereotypes were common to US culture, exemplified by the cinematic versions of the Asian detectives Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) and Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre), originally literary detectives in novels and comic strips. White actors portrayed the Asian men and made the fictional characters socially acceptable in mainstream American cinema, especially when the villains were secret agents of Imperial Japan.\n\nNotable American proponents of the Japanese Yellow Peril were the military-industrial interests of the China Lobby (right-wing intellectuals, businessmen, Christian missionaries) who were political advocates for the warlord \"Generalíssimo\" Chiang Kai-shek, whom they represented as the (Methodist-convert) Christian-Chinese saviour of China, then in the middle of civil war. After the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the China Lobby successfully pressured the politically neutral US government to aid the China of Chiang Kai-shek. The media coverage (print, radio and cinema) of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) favoured China, which politically facilitated the American financing and equipping of the anticommunist Kuomintang, the Chiang Kai-shek faction in the Chinese Civil War (1927–1937, 1946–1950), which also featured the Communist Mao Zedong.\n\nIn 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration formally declared China an ally of the US. In political compliance with the government, the American media then modified the use of Yellow Peril ideology and criticised contemporary anti-Chinese laws as counterproductive to the war effort against Imperial Japan. The wartime \"zeitgeist\" and the geopolitics of the US government presumed that defeat of the Japanese Empire would be followed by post-war China developing into a major capitalist economy, under the strongman leadership of the Christian \"Generalíssimo\" Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party).\n\nHowever, in the course of his political and personal relations with the US government, and his China Lobby sponsors, Chiang requested the repeal of American anti-Chinese laws and to achieve the repeals, threatened to exclude the American business community from the \"China Market\", the economic fantasy that the China Lobby promised to the military and industrial interests of the US. In 1943, the US government repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, but because the National Origins Act of 1924 was contemporary law, the repeal was a symbolic gesture of American solidarity with the people of China.\n\nScience fiction writer William F. Wu, said that American adventure, crime, and detective pulp magazines in the 1930s had many Yellow Peril characters, loosely based on Fu Manchu, and that although \"most [Yellow Peril characters] were of Chinese descent\", the Asian geopolitics of the time led people to see Japan as a threat to the United States. In his book \"The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850–1940\" (1982), Wu said that fear of Asians dates from the European Middle Ages during the 13th-century Mongol invasion of Europe. Most Europeans had never seen an Asian man or woman, and the great differences in language, custom and physique accounted for European paranoia about the nonwhite peoples from the Eastern world.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Australians desiring a proper country and a white society, feared the Yellow Peril for possession of the continent. The racialist fear of the non-white Asian Other was a thematic preoccupation common to invasion literature novels like \"The Yellow Wave: A Romance of the Asiatic Invasion of Australia\" (1895), \"The Coloured Conquest\" (1904), \"The Awakening to China\" (1909), \"Fools' Harvest\" (1939). They usually featured an Asian invasion of the \"empty north\" of Australia, which was really populated by the Aboriginal Australians, the native non-white Other. In the novel \"White or Yellow?: A Story of the Race War of A.D. 1908\" (1887), William Lane, a journalist and labour leader, believed that a horde of Chinese people legally arrived to Australia overran white society and monopolized the industries important to exploiting the natural resources of the \"empty north\" of Australia.\n\nAs Australian invasion literature, \"White or Yellow?\" reflects Lane's nationalist racialism and left-wing politics in a future history of Australia under attack by the Yellow Peril. In the near future, British capitalists manipulate the legal system and successfully arrange the mass immigration of Chinese workers to Australia, regardless of the socioeconomic consequences to Australian common folk and their society. The economic, cultural, and sexual conflicts that resulted from the capitalists' manipulation of the economy provoke a white-yellow race war throughout Australia. The racialist representations of Yellow Peril ideology in the narrative of \"White or Yellow?\" justify white Australians' killing the Chinese workers as an existential response for physical and economic control of Australia. Moreover, the leaders of the labour and trade unions greatly opposed the importation of Chinese workers, whom they portrayed as an economic (low-wage) threat to Australia, and as a moral threat (libertinism) to Christian civilization, which addresses the psychosexual theme of miscegenation (mixing of the races), which is an apolitical call to racial unity among white Australians.\n\nCulturally, Asian-invasion novels expressed the white man's sexual fear of voracious Asian sexuality with scenes of a white woman in sexual peril, usually rape or seduction, aided by the sensual and moral release of opium. A white woman who was raped or seduced by a Chinese man had suffered \"a fate worse than death\". Thus defiled, the woman is a sexual untouchable to other white men. In that moralistic vein, in the 1890s, labour activist and feminist Rose Summerfield voiced the white female sexual fear of the Yellow Peril by warning society of the unnatural lust in the eyes of Chinese men when they looked upon the pulchritude of the white women of Australia.\n\nIn 1901, the Australian federal government adopted the White Australia policies, initiated with the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, which generally excluded Asian peoples, especially the Chinese and the Melanesians. Historian C.E.W. Bean said that Australian racialist exclusion was \"a vehement effort to maintain a high, Western standard of economy, society, and culture (necessitating, at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).\" In 1913, the film, \"Australia Calls\" (1913) depicted an invasion of Australia by \"Mongolians\" defeated by ordinary Australians with resistance and guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference (28 June 1919), supported by Britain and the US, the Australian Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, vehemently opposed Imperial Japan's recommendation for the inclusion of the Racial Equality Proposal in Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations on 13 February 1919:\n\nAware that Britain opposed the formal inclusion of the clause to Article 21 of the Covenant, the conference chairman, US President Woodrow Wilson, prevented \"de jure\" racial equality among the nations of the world by unilaterally requiring a unanimous vote by the participant countries. On 11 April 1919, most countries in the conference voted to include a universal clause for racial equality Article 21 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, opposed only by Britain and the US. Moreover, to maintain the White Australian policy, the Australian government sided with Britain in the vote against Japan's clause for racial equality, a defeat in international relations that greatly influenced Imperial Japan to turn from co-operation to confrontation with the West.\n\nIn 1890s France, the \"Péril jaune\" (Yellow Peril) was invoked in negative comparisons of the low French birth rate of the French and the high Asian birth rate. Accordingly, there was the cultural fear that one day Asians would \"flood\" France, which could be successfully countered only by increased fecundity of French women. Then, France would possess enough soldiers to thwart the eventual flood of immigrants from Asia. From that racialist perspective, the French press sided with Imperial Russia during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) and represented the Russians as heroically defending the white race against the Japanese Yellow Peril.\n\nIn 1904, the French journalist René Pinon reported the cultural, geopolitical and existential threat to white civilisation in the West:\nDespite the Christian idealism of the civilizing mission, from the start of colonialisation in 1858, the French exploited the land of Vietnam as inexhaustible and the Vietnamese people as beasts of burden. During the First Indochina War, (1946–1954) the French justified their colonial return of Vietnam as defense of the white West against the \"péril jaune\" – specifically the Communist Party of Vietnam, as puppets of Red China in the communist conspiracy to conquer the world. Hence, French orientalism defined the Asian Other as less than human, combined with anticommunism, which dehumanisation allowed atrocities against Viet Minh prisoners of war, during \"la sale guerre\", the dirty war against international communism. The Yellow Peril metaphors in French anti-communist media portrayed the Viet Minh as part of the \"innombrables masses jaunes\" (innumerable yellow hordes) and one of many \"vagues hurlantes\" (roaring waves) of \"masses fanatisées\" (fanatical hordes).\n\nIn \"Behind the Bamboo Hedge: The Impact of Homeland Politics in the Parisian Vietnamese Community\" (1991), Gisèle Luce Bousquet, said that the \"péril jaune\", which traditionally colours French perceptions of Asians, especially of the Vietnamese, remains a cultural prejudice of contemporary France. Hence, the Vietnamese people in France are perceived and resented as academic overachievers who take jobs from \"native French\" people.\n\nIn 2015, the front cover of the January issue of \"Fluide Glacial\" magazine featured a cartoon, \"Yellow Peril: Is it Already Too Late?\", which depicts a Chinese-occupied Paris where a sad Frenchman pulling a rickshaw, with a Chinese passenger (dressed as a 19th c. French colonial official) accompanied by a barely-dressed, blonde French woman. The editor of \"Fluide Glacial\", Yan Lindingre defended the cover and the subject as satire and mockery of French fears of China's economic threat to France. In an editorial directed to the complaining Chinese, Lindingre said, \"I have just ordered an extra billion copies printed, and will send them to you via a chartered flight. This will help us balance our trade deficit and give you a good laugh\".\n\nIn the 20th century, from their perspective, as non-white nations in a world order dominated by the white nations, the geopolitics of Ethiopia–Japan relations allowed Imperial Japan and Ethiopia to avoid European imperial colonisation of their countries and nations. Before the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1934–1936), Imperial Japan had given diplomatic and military support to Ethiopia against invasion by the Fascist Italy, which implied military assistance. In response to that Asian anti-imperialism, Benito Mussolini ordered a Yellow Peril propaganda campaign by the Italian press, which represented Imperial Japan as the military, cultural, and existential threat to the Western world, by way of the dangerous \"yellow race–black race\" alliance meant to unite Asians and Africans against the white people of the world.\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini warned of the Japanese Yellow Peril, specifically the racial threat of Asia and Africa uniting against Europe. In the summer of 1935, the National Fascist Party (1922–43) often staged anti–Japanese political protests throughout Italy. Nonetheless, as right-wing imperial powers, Japan and Italy pragmatically agreed to disagree; in exchange for Italian diplomatic recognition of Manchukuo (1932–45), the Japanese puppet state in China, Imperial Japan would not aid Ethiopia against Italian invasion and so Italy would end the anti–Japanese Yellow Peril propaganda in the national press of Italy.\n\nDuring the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), Chinese-Mexicans were subjected to racist abuse, like before the revolt, for not being Christians, specifically Roman Catholic, for not being racially Mexican, and for not soldiering and fighting in the Revolution against the thirty-five-year dictatorship (1876–1911) of General Porfirio Díaz.\n\nThe notable atrocity against the Yellow Peril was the three-day Torreón massacre (13–15 May 1911) in northern Mexico, wherein the military forces of Francisco I. Madero killed 308 Asian people (303 Chinese, 5 Japanese), because they were deemed a cultural threat to the Mexican way of life. The massacre of Chinese- and Japanese-Mexicans at the city of Torreón, Coahulia State, was not the only such atrocity perpetrated in the Revolution. Elsewhere, in 1913, after the Constitutional Army captured the city of Tamasopo, San Luis Potosí state, the soldiers and the town-folk expelled the Yellow Peril from town by sacking and burning the Chinatown.\n\nDuring and after the Mexican Revolution, the Roman Catholic prejudices of Yellow Peril ideology facilitated racial discrimination and violence against Chinese Mexicans, usually for \"stealing jobs\" from native Mexicans, etc. Anti–Chinese, nativist propaganda misrepresented the Chinese people as unhygienic, prone to immorality (miscegenation, gambling, opium-smoking) and spreading diseases that would biologically corrupt and degenerate \"La Raza\" (the Mexican race) and generally undermining the Mexican patriarchy.\n\nMoreover, from the racialist perspective, besides stealing work from Mexican men, Chinese men were stealing Mexican women from the native Mexican men who were away fighting the Revolution, overthrowing and expelling the dictator Porfirio Díaz and his foreign sponsors from Mexico. In the 1930s, approximately 70% of the Chinese and the Chinese–Mexican population was expelled from the Mexican United States by the bureaucratic ethnic culling of the Mexican population.\n\nIn 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) achieved political dominance, reinforced, five years later, after the Raid on the Sublime Porte in 1913. The CuP greatly admired the Japanese for modernising their country while retaining its \"Eastern spiritual essence\", and it proclaimed its intention to transform the Ottoman Empire into the \"Japan of the Near East\".\n\nIn an inversion of the Yellow Peril racism of the Western world, the Young Turks thought of entering an alliance with Imperial Japan that would unite all the peoples of \"the East\" to wage a war of extermination against the much-hated Western nations whose empires dominated the world. Culturally, for the Young Turks, the term \"yellow\" symbolised the \"Eastern gold\" colour that represents the innate moral superiority of the Eastern world over the corrupt, materialistic West.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1910, the Unionist Government of the Britain authorised the immigration to South Africa of approximately 63,000 Chinese labourers to work the gold mines in the Witwatersrand basin after the conclusion of the Second Boer War. After 1910, most Chinese miners were repatriated to China because of the great opposition to them, as \"coloured people\", in the white society of South Africa, much like the anti–Chinese laws in the US during the early 20th century.\n\nThe mass immigration of indentured Chinese labourers to mine South African gold for wages lower than acceptable to the native white men, contributed to the electoral loss of the financially-conservative British Unionist government that then governed South Africa.\n\nOn 26 March 1904, approximately 80,000 people attended the social-protest demonstration against the use of Chinese labourers in the Transvaal was held in Hyde Park, London, to publicise the exploitation of Chinese South Africans. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress then passed a resolution declaring:\n\nIn the event, despite the racial violence between white South African miners and Chinese miners, the Unionist government achieved the economic recovery of South Africa after the Anglo–Boer War by making the gold mines of the Witwatersrand Basin the most productive in the world.\n\nIn recent years, there have been very strong anti-Chinese feelings in Turkey owing to allegations of human rights abuses against the Muslim Turkic Uighur people in China's Xinjiang province. At one anti-Chinese demonstration in Istanbul, a South Korean tourist was threatened with violence even she protested that \"I am not Chinese, I am Korean\". In response, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Movement Party stated: \"How does one distinguish between Chinese and Koreans? Both have slanted eyes\".\n\nIn the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, populist Prime Minister Richard Seddon compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote racialist politics in New Zealand. In 1879, in his first political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores \"deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with them. All you can get from them is 'No savvy'\".\n\nMoreover, in 1905, in the city of Wellington, the fanatical white supremacist Lionel Terry murdered Joe Kum Yung, an old Chinese man, in protest against Asian immigration to New Zealand. Laws promulgated to limit Chinese immigration included a heavy poll tax, introduced in 1881 and lowered in 1937, after Imperial Japan's invasion and occupation of China. In 1944, the poll tax was abolished, and the New Zealand government formally apologised to the Chinese populace of New Zealand.\n\nThe core of Yellow Peril ideology is the white man's fear of Oriental sexual voracity; of the Seducer and the Seductress (Dragon Lady and Lotus Blossom) who possess an unnatural and perverse sex appeal that is a moral and a mortal threat to the white civilisation of the Christian West. Racist revulsion towards miscegenation – interracial sexual intercourse – communicated with sexual stereotypes of the Yellow Peril, derives from the fear of mixed-race children, whose existence threatens Whiteness proper.\n\nThe seductive Asian man (wealthy and cultured) was the more common form of white-male fear of the Asian sexual Other. In the Asian seducer, the sexual threat of the Yellow Peril was realised with successful sexual competition – seduction or rape – which irredeemably corrupted the white woman, beyond redemption. (see: \"55 Days at Peking\", 1963) The American critic Gary Hoppenstand identified interracial sexual-intercourse as a threat to the culture of whiteness:\n\nIn \"The Cheat\" (1915), the wealthy Hishuru Tori (Sessue Hayakawa) is a Japanese sexual predator and sadist whose attentions menace Edith Hardy (Fannie Ward), an American housewife. Although superficially Westernized, Tori is a rapist, which reflects his true cultural identity as an Asian man. In being \"brutal and cultivated, wealthy and base, cultured and barbaric, Tori embodies the contradictory qualities Americans associate with Japan\". Initially, the story presents Tori as an \"asexual\" man associating with the high society of Long Island; yet, once Edith is in his private study, decorated with Japanese art, he is a man of \"brooding, implicitly sadistic sexuality\". At times, before Tori attempts to rape Edith, the narrative of the story implies that she is attracted to him and corresponds his sexual interest in her. To assure commercial success, the cast of \"The Cheat\" (1915) featured the Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa – who was a male sex symbol in the cinema of that time – which was a cultural fact that resonated on-screen and off-screen as a sexual threat to the existing racial hierarchy and sexual mores of white men in 1915.\n\nIn \"Shanghai Express\" (1932), General Henry Chang (Warner Oland) is a warlord of Eurasian origin (Chinese and American), whom the narrative presents as an asexual man, which excludes him from the realm of Western sexual mores and the racialist order; thus, he is dangerous to the Westerners he holds hostage. Though Chang is Eurasian, he is prouder of his Chinese heritage, and rejects his American heritage, which rejection confirms his Oriental identity.\n\nIn 1931, the Chinese civil war has rendered the country into a version of Hell, which a diverse group of Westerners must traverse by train, from Beijing to Shanghai, a voyage that turns for the worse when General Chang's soldiers hijack the train. The story implies that Gen. Chang is a bisexual man who desires to rape the heroine, Shanghai Lily (Marlene Dietrich), and the hero, Captain Donald \"Doc\" Harvey (Clive Brook).\n\nMoreover, when the German opium smuggler Erich Baum (Gustav von Seyffertitz) insults Chang, the warlord symbolically rapes him by branding; the sadistic Chang derives sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker. After being branded, the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive to Chang, then owns him in realisation of the ultimate fear of the Yellow Peril: Westerners enslaved to the unnatural and perverse sexuality of the East; later, Chang rapes Hui Fei (Anna May Wong).\n\nGen. Chang's desire to blind Capt. Harvey also is a castration metaphor, a taboo subject even for the intellectually permissive Production code in effect in 1932. In marked contrast to Chang's bisexuality and his \"almost effeminate polish\", the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual man, a tough, rugged soldier tested and proved in the trenches of the First World War (1914–18); the Briton is a model of Western masculinity and strength. Throughout, the narrative implies that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are in a lesbian relationship, thus, at story's end, Lily's choice of Capt. Harvey as her lover, reaffirms the heterosexual appeal of the Western man and redeems her from prostitution.\n\nThe narrative of \"Shanghai Express\" embraces the stereotypes of the Yellow Peril through the Eurasian character of Gen. Chang, and also undermines their inhumanity through the suffering of Hui Fei, who cries inconsolably after Chang raped her, such humanity allows the audience to sympathize with a non-white Other. As a courtesan, Hui Fei is condescended to by every Western character, except her best friend Lily, because of her race and profession, but is shown as dignified woman who stands up for herself. At the climax, Hui Fei kills Gen. Chang to save Harvey from being blinded by him; she explains that killing Chang regained the self-respect he had taken from her. Throughout, the narrative has suggested that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are more attracted to each other than to Capt. Harvey. That detail of character, which suggests that Hui Fei is sexually abnormal, was socially daring drama in 1932, because Western mores considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural. The same criticism of sexual orientation might apply to Lily, but the story concludes with resumed heterosexuality, when she kisses Capt. Harvey, while Hui Fei walks away alone, sad for having been raped and for losing her best friend to Capt. Harvey.\n\nThe Dragon Lady is a cultural representation of white fear of Asian female sexuality. The Asian seductress is a charming, beautiful, and sexually insatiable woman who readily and easily dominates men. As a sexual Other, the dragon-lady woman is a tempting, but morally degrading object of desire for the white man.\n\nIn Western cinema genre, the cowboy town features an Asian woman who usually portrayed as a scheming prostitute, always seeking to use her sexuality (charisma and physical sex-appeal) to beguile and dominate the white man. In the American television program Ally McBeal (1997–2002), the Yellow Peril featured the Dragon Lady stereotype, personified as the Ling Woo character, a domineering woman whose Chinese ethnicity includes sexual abilities that no white woman could hope to match.\n\nIn the late 20th century, such a sexual representation of the Yellow Peril, introduced in the comic strip \"Terry and the Pirates\" (27 September 1936), indicates that the Western imagination continues to associate Asia, as a region of exotic beauty and material opulence, of moral laxity and sensual excess, and of cultural decadence. To the Westerner, the seductiveness of the Orient implies spiritual threat and hidden existential danger, derived from the desire to be enticed and hypnotized, to be entrapped and suffocated in a masochistic surrender of white identity, \"to be engulfed by what Freudians might describe as a metaphoric womb–tomb\".\n\nA variant Yellow-Peril seductress is presented in the white-saviour romance between a \"White Knight\" from the West and a \"Lotus Blossom\" from the East; each redeems the other by way of mutual romantic love. Despite being a threat to the passive sexuality of white women, the romantic narrative favourably portrays the Lotus Blossom character as a woman who needs the love of a white man to rescue her from objectification by a flawed Asian culture. As a heroine, the Lotus-Blossom-woman is an ultra-feminine model of Asian pulchritude, social grace, and culture, whose own people trapped her in an inferior, gender-determined social-class. Only a white man can rescue her from such a cultural impasse, thereby, the narrative reaffirms the moral superiority of the Western world.\n\nIn \"The World of Suzie Wong\" (1960), the eponymous anti-heroine is a lost-soul prostitute saved by the love of Robert Lomax (William Holden), an American painter living in Hong Kong. The East–West sexual differences available to Lomax are two: an unpleasant, career-minded British girlfriend, Kay O'Neill (Sylvia Syms), who is mannishly independent; and Suzie Wong, who is a conventionally feminine and submissive woman. She works as a sexual prostitute because of her poverty in Hong Kong, which, the story suggests, is the natural condition of the peoples of Asia.\nMoreover, in 1959, the economic ascendancy of Hong Kong, as part of the \"Asian Tiger Economy\", had just begun to improve life for the Chinese. Nonetheless, despite the film's historical inaccuracy of background, the cultural contrast of the representations of Suzie Wong and Kay O'Neill imply that if a Western woman wants to win a cultured, Western man (like the painter Robert Lomax) she should emulate the sexually passive prostitute (Suzie Wong) rather than the independent and \"controlling\" career-woman (Kay O'Neill). As an Oriental stereotype, the submissive Asian girl (Lotus -Blossom Wong) shows her innate masochism when she \"proudly displays signs of a beating, to her fellow hookers, and uses it as evidence that her man loves her\", which condition further increases Lomax's need to rescue her.\n\nPsychologically, the painter Lomax needs the prostitute Wong, as the muse whose eroticism inspires the self-discipline necessary for becoming an accomplished painter. Suzie Wong is an illiterate orphan who was sexually abused as a girl; thus her toleration of abuse by most of her Chinese clients. That Lomax is portrayed as more enlightened and caring, than Chinese and British men, implies the moral superiority of the American culture over the decadent society of Hong Kong and over the decayed British Empire; the Americans shall be better geopolitical and cultural custodians of Asia than were the British. When a British sailor attempts to rape Wong, the chivalrous Lomax rescues her and beats the would-be rapist; all the while, Chinese men sat by, indifferent to the rape of a prostitute.\n\nAs a Lotus Blossom stereotype of the Yellow Peril, the prostitute Suzie Wong is a single mother, of a child, by a Chinese man who abandoned them; the socially dramatic backstory of the woman emphasises the casual cruelty of Hong Kong's Asian society. In contrast to the casual brutality (emotional and physical) with which Chinese and British characters treat Wong, the sensitive artist Lomax loves her as a \"child–woman\", and saves her with a new social identity as his Lotus Blossom, an ideal woman who is docile under his paternalism. Yet Lomax's love is conditional; throughout the story, she wears a Chinese Cheongsam dress, but when she dresses in Western clothes, Lomax rips off her dress, and orders her to only wear a cheongsam – Suzie Wong is acceptable only as an Asian girl created in conformity to the Western cultural mores of proper womanhood and femininity.\n\nIn the opera \"Miss Saigon\" (1989), the country of Vietnam is represented as a beautifully exotic and mysterious place of sensuous beauty, incomprehensible savagery, and much filth. The opening chorus of the first song, \"The Heat's on Saigon\", begins thus: \"The heat's on Saigon / The girls are hotter 'n hell / Tonight one of these slits will be Miss Saigon / God, the tension is high / Not to mention the smell\".\n\nThe first act, set in Saigon City, presents the adolescent prostitute-heroine named Kim, who is portrayed as a demure \"Lotus Blossom\" who is a sexually available and submissive Asian woman whose life is defined by her love for a white man, the American Marine Chris Scott. That every Vietnamese woman is a prostitute, and that all, but one, are Dragon Ladies who easily display their bodies in bikini swim suits, confirms the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman. The second act, set in Thailand, portrays Thai women as prostitutes, and reinforces the Western stereotype of the hyper-sexual Asian woman who is perpetually available to copulate. At the Dreamland brothel, Kim is the only woman who does not always dress in a bikini swimsuit. Her passivity, moral purity, and fidelity to the Marine Chris, who abandoned her and their son in South Vietnam, returned to the U.S. and married the American woman Ellen, suggests that subservience is the proper relation between an Asian woman and a white man.\n\nDespite working as a prostitute, the seventeen-year-old Kim is a virginal innocent who needs the Marine Chris to protect her from the cruel world of Saigon City. One of the songs that Chris sings about her suggests that Kim is Vietnam. In contrast to the aggressive Vietnamese male characters, the passive Kim is portrayed as being the true Vietnam. Moreover, the man Thuy, a Viet Cong guerrilla who wants to marry Kim, is portrayed as a jealous and possessive, violent and cruel man who seeks to exploit her, the opposite of Chris, who only seeks to love her. The character of the pimp, Tran Van Dinh, aka \"The Engineer\", is a Eurasian man whose sexuality is \"simply incomprehensible, illegible, indeterminate, even as it is spectacularly displayed\".\n\nEast Asia studies Professor Karen Shimakawa described the Engineer as \"simultaneously lascivious, sexually exploitative, pan-sexual \"and\" desexualized.\" Although the character was born of a French father and a Vietnamese mother, the libretto always emphasises his Oriental-ness. \"The Engineer embodies an un-categorizable, yet spectacular perversity – a condition that, the logic of the play suggests, is hereditary: It is the direct result of his racially and nationally mixed beginnings in prostitution and sexual debauchery\". The best friend of Chris, is a black man named John, an enthusiastic patron of the Dreamland brothel, fulfils the racial stereotype of the sexually voracious black man. Unlike the romantic Chris, John is given to crude, macho boasting about his sexual prowess, and only sees the women of the Dreamland brothel as sexual objects. In contrast to the flawed masculinity of the coloured men, the white Chris is a kind, gentle man who genuinely loves Kim, and sings: \"I wanted to save her, protect her / Christ, I'm an American / How could I fail to do good?\".\n\nThe essence of the Western fear of the Yellow Peril is that Asian men and women are sexually voracious people, whose Oriental cultures emphasise the sensual and sensuous aspects of life. As such, Oriental sexuality threatens the moral destruction of the Christian West, by way of enslavement to the senses. Prof. Tim Thompson said that a \"perfect example\" of such sexual fear of the Asian Other is the Canadian short story \"The Fall: With a Whimper\" (2007), by Tantric Legion, in the genre of graphic-pornography horror-story.\n\nIntelligent, hermaphrodite worms arrive to China from outer space; they are \"sexual parasites\" approximately one-foot in length and three-inches in diameter. In the scenes of infectious rape, the phallic worms penetrate the human body through vaginas and anuses, and then assume control of the victim's mind. The protagonist, Mei, a pretty, young schoolteacher in Jiuquan. In the first half of the story, the frightened Mei continually attempts to avoid infection, to no avail. After being infected, she sets out to infect the rest of humanity. As the self-named \"Mei host\", she considers herself a \"good slave\" who longs only to do the bidding of her \"masters\", her affectionate name for the worms that control her mind and body. Their \"one, fervent wish\" is to create a \"glorious, new civilization\" that will bless humanity with a \"shared consciousness\". Moreover, the worms also transform the bodies of the victims, and Mei host, now endowed with \"swollen breasts and a constant state of sexual arousal\", has no trouble seducing people, whom she infects with the phallic worms.\n\nThe authorial voice of the narrative presents Mei's transformation, from demure-\"Stoneman\"></ref> The images of flooding and bodily penetration evoke Yellow-Peril racism, and the classic, white xenophobia of the Chinese as a faceless horde overwhelming the rest of humanity, specifically, the white peoples of Western Europe and North America. Because the phallic worms are hermaphrodite, the infected Chinese are a literal foreign body infecting the men and women who are the world polity. Thematically, \"The Fall: With a Whimper\" evokes the white Christian fear of ambiguous sexual orientation; Western sexual anxieties psychologically projected onto the Asian Other. ()\n\nThe Yellow Peril was a common subject for colonial adventure fiction, of which the representative villain is Dr. Fu Manchu, created by Sax Rohmer, and featured in thirteen novels (1913–59). Fu Manchu is an evil Chinese gangster and mad scientist who means to conquer the world, despite continually being foiled by the British policeman and gentleman spy Sir Denis Nayland Smith, and his assistant Dr. Petrie.\n\nFu Manchu was patterned on the antagonist of the Yellow Peril series and novel \"The Yellow Danger; Or, what Might Happen in the Division of the Chinese Empire Should Estrange all European Countries\" (1898), by M. P. Shiel, published initially as the serial story \"The Empress of the Earth: The Tale of the Yellow War\"; and published in the U.S. first as \"China in Arms\" (1898), and then revised as \"The Yellow Danger: The Story of the World's Greatest War\" (1899) \n\nIn the context of the Fu Manchu series, and Shiel's influence, reviewer Jack Adrian described Sax Rohmer as a \n\nDr. Fu Manchu is the head of the Si-Fan, an international criminal organisation and a pan-Asian murder gang recruited from the \"darkest places of the East\" with countless Chinese, Burmese, Malay, and Indian thugs willing to perform any command. The novels feature the recurring scene wherein Fu Manchu despatches assassins (usually Chinese or Indian) to kill Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie. In the course of adventure, they are surrounded by coloured foreigners wishing to harm them; the metaphor is that the East has trespassed into the West.\n\nIn the 1930s, Hollywood offered two contradictory images of Asian men: (i) The malevolent master-criminal, Dr. Fu Manchu; and (ii) The benevolent master-detective, Charlie Chan. As a Yellow Peril villain, Fu Manchu is \"Rohmer's concoction of cunning Asian villainy [that] connects with the irrational fears of proliferation and incursion: Racist myths often carried by the water imagery of flood, deluge, the tidal waves of immigrants, rivers of blood.\" In 1936, when the Nazis banned his novels in Germany, because they believed him Jewish, Sax Rohmer denied being racist and published a letter declaring himself \"a good Irishman\", wherein he was disingenuous about the why of the Nazi book-ban, because \"my stories are not inimical to Nazi ideals.\"\n\n\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" (1932) reflects the white man's sexual-anxiety as the basis of Yellow Peril fear; thus Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) urges his Asian army to \"Kill the white man and take his women!\" Incest, between father and daughter, is a recurrent theme in the narrative of \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\", especially the ambiguous nature of the relationship between Fu Manchu and his daughter, Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy), an example of the unnatural sexuality of the yellow race.\n\nEmperor Ming the Merciless, nemesis of Flash Gordon, was another iteration of the Fu Manchu trope. Peter Feng calls him a \"futuristic Yellow Peril\", quoting a reviewer who referred to Ming as a \"slanty eyed, shiny domed, pointy nailed, arching eyebrowed, exotically dressed Oriental\". Likewise, Buck Rogers fought against the Mongol Reds (aka the Hans), who had conquered the U.S. in the 25th century. In the late 1950s, Atlas Comics (Marvel Comics) published the Yellow Claw, a pastiche of the Fu Manchu stories. In the 1970s, Marvel Comics used Fu Manchu as the principal foe of his son, Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu.\n\nThe villain Li Shoon, created by H. Irving Hancock, appeared in \"Under the Ban of Li Shoon\" and \"Li Shoon's Deadliest Mission\" in Detective Story Magazine in 1916. Yellow Peril racial stereotypes were common currency in the genre literature of pulp magazine fiction of the early 20th century. Physically, Li Shoon is a \"tall and stout\" man with \"a round, moon-like yellow face\" with \"bulging eyebrows\" above \"sunken eyes\". Personally, Li Shoon is \"an amazing compound of evil\" and intellect, which makes him \"a wonder at everything wicked\" and \"a marvel of satanic cunning.\" In 1937, the publisher DC Comics featured \"Ching Lung\" on the cover and in the first issue of \"Detective Comics\" (March 1937).\n\n\"Yellow Peril: The Adventures of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe\", by Richard Jaccoma (1978) is a pastiche of the Fu Manchu novels by Sax Rohmer. Set in the 1930s, the novel is a distillation of the psychosexual and racist stereotypes of the Dragon Lady seductress and of the ruthless Mongol who threaten Western civilisation. The story is told in the genre's traditional first-person narrative of Sir John Weymouth–Smythe, an anti-hero who is simultaneously a lecher and a prude, continually torn between sensual desire and Victorian sensibility. The plot concerns Weymouth–Smythe's quest for the Spear of Destiny, a relic with supernatural power, which gives the possessor control of the world. Throughout the story, Weymouth–Smythe spends much time battling the nominal villain, Chou en Shu, for possession of the Spear of Destiny. In the course of the action, thematic developments reveal that the Yellow Peril is not the villain, but the (Nazi) Germans who were ostensible allies of the British anti-hero, Weymouth–Smythe, in the quest for the Spear of Destiny. The Nazis are led by Clara Schicksal, a stereotypical Teutonic blonde woman who sacrifices Burmese boys to ancient German gods, whilst fellating them; later, Weymouth–Symthe punishes Schicksal by sodomizing her.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "214536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214536", "title": "Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory", "text": "Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory\n\nZionist occupation government, Zionist occupational government, or Zionist-occupied government (abbreviated as ZOG) is an antisemitic conspiracy theory that claims \"Jewish agents\" secretly control the governments of Western states. Other variants such as \"Jewish occupational government\" are sometimes used.\n\nThe expression is used by white supremacist, far-right, nativist, or antisemitic groups in the United States and Europe, as well as by ultra-nationalists such as \"Pamyat\" in Russia, and various far-right groups including the Freemen, Identity Christians, Odinists, and Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe word \"Zionist\" in \"Zionist Occupation Government\" should not be confused with the ideology of Zionism, the movement for support of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel. Because the conspiracy theorists chiefly name countries outside that area, the usage of \"Zionist\" in this context is misleading, and it is intended to portray Jews as conspirators who aim to control the world, as in the forged \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nAn early appearance of the term was in a 1976 article, \"Welcome to ZOG-World\", attributed to an American neo-Nazi named Eric Thomson. It also features as the main theme in the 1978 book, \"The Turner Diaries\", written by William Luther Pierce (founder of white nationalist organization the National Alliance). The term came to the attention of a larger audience in a December 27, 1984, article in \"The New York Times\" about robberies committed in California and Washington by a white supremacist group called The Order. According to the newspaper, the crimes \"were conducted to raise money for a war upon the United States Government, which the group calls 'ZOG', or Zionist Occupation Government\".\n\nThe Order of the Silent Brotherhood was an offshoot of the Aryan Nations, an organization founded in the early 1970s by Richard Girnt Butler; the latter had since the 1950s been associated with another antisemitic group, the Church of Jesus Christ Christian. Both of these groups trace their origins to antisemitic activists, like Gerald L. K. Smith, and they have interacted with the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe term appeared extensively in Aryan Nations literature. In December 1984, \"Newsweek\" magazine reported that the Aryan Nations had set up an electronic bulletin board (BBS) called \"Aryan Nation Liberty Net\" to offer information, for instance, the locations of Communist Party offices and \"ZOG informers\".\n\nIn 1985, the Oregon-based far-right group Posse Comitatus claimed: \"Our nation is now completely under the control of the International Invisible government of World Jewry.\"\n\nIn 1996, the Aryan Nations posted on its website an \"Aryan Declaration of Independence\", stating that \"the history of the present Zionist Occupied Government of the United States of America is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations ... [all] having a direct object—the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.\" Claiming that \"the eradication of the White race and its culture\" is \"one of its foremost purposes\", the \"ZOG\" is accused of relinquishing \"powers of government to private corporations, White traitors and ruling class Jewish families\".\n\nSince 1996, the term has spread in usage, and is now popular with many other antisemitic organizations. Swedish Neo-Nazis, for example, say that Jews—in what they call the Swedish Zionist Occupied Government—are importing immigrants to \"dilute the blood of the white race\". The antisemitic website Jew Watch claims that the entire spectrum of Western nations and other countries are being ruled by \"Zionist Occupation Governments\".\n\n\n"}
