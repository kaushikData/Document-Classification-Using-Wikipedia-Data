The term derives from Freudian psychoanalysis.\n\nIn Freudian psychology, the anal stage is said to follow the oral stage of infant or early-childhood development. This is a time when an infant's attention moves from oral stimulation to anal stimulation (usually the bowels but occasionally the bladder), usually synchronous with learning to control their excretory functions—in other words, any form of child training and not specifically linked to toilet training. Freud posited that children who experience conflicts, in which libido energy is under-indulged during this period of time, and the child is perhaps too strongly chastised for toilet-training accidents, may develop \"anal retentive\" fixations or personality traits. These traits are associated with a child's efforts at excretory control: orderliness, stubbornness, and compulsions for control. Conversely, those who are overindulged during this period may develop \"anal-expulsive\" personality types.\n\nFreud's theories on early childhood have been influential on the psychological community; the phrase \"anal retentive\" and the term \"anal\" survive in common usage. The second edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\" (DSM-II) introduced obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), with a definition based on Freud's description of anal-retentive personality. But the association between OCPD and toilet training is largely regarded as unsupported \"pop-psychology\" and therefore discredited by the majority of psychologists of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. There is no conclusive research linking anal stage conflicts with \"anal\" personality types. Research suggests that the overall pattern of parental attitudes has a much more concrete effect on how an infant will grow up.\n\n"}
{"id": "5003360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5003360", "title": "Analogical models", "text": "Analogical models\n\nAnalogical models are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the \"target system\" by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called dynamical analogies.\n\nTwo open systems have \"analog\" representations (see illustration) if they are black box isomorphic systems.\n\nAnalogizing is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system). A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called \"analog\" or \"analogue\" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce \"a priori\" knowledge of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p. 1-3).\n\nFor example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use voltage to represent an arithmetic quantity; operational amplifiers might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of calibration these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a \"one-to-one correspondence in behaviour\" between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one.\n\nMany different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the Phillips Hydraulic Computer MONIAC used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of simulation.\n\nAny number of systems could be used for mapping electrical phenomena to mechanical phenomena, but two principle systems are commonly used: the impedance analogy and the mobility analogy. The impedance analogy maps force to voltage whereas the mobility analogy maps force to current.\n\nThe impedance analogy preserves the analogy between electrical impedance and mechanical impedance but does not preserve the network topology. The mobility analogy preserves the network topology but does not preserve the analogy between impedances. Both preserve the correct energy and power relationships by making power conjugate pairs of variables analogous.\n\n\n\n\nDynamical analogies establish analogies between systems in different energy domains by means of comparison of the system dynamic equations. There are many ways such analogies can be built, but one of the most useful methods is to form analogies between pairs of power conjugate variables. That is, a pair of variables whose product is power. Doing so preserves the correct energy flow between domains, a useful feature when modelling a system as an integrated whole. Examples of systems that require unified modelling are mechatronics and audio electronics.\n\nThe earliest such analogy is due to James Clerk Maxwell who, in 1873, associated mechanical force with electrical voltage. This analogy became so widespread that sources of voltage are still today referred to as electromotive force. The power conjugate of voltage is electric current which, in the Maxwell analogy, maps to mechanical velocity. Electrical impedance is the ratio of voltage and current, so by analogy, mechanical impedance is the ratio of force and velocity. The concept of impedance can be extended to other domains, for instance in acoustics and fluid flow it is the ratio of pressure to rate of flow. In general, impedance is the ratio of an \"effort\" variable and the \"flow\" variable that results. For this reason, the Maxwell analogy is often referred to as the impedance analogy, although the concept of impedance was not conceived until 1886 by Oliver Heaviside, some time after Maxwell's death.\n\nSpecifying power conjugate variables still does not result in a unique analogy, there are multiple ways the conjugates and analogies can be specified. A new analogy was proposed by Floyd A. Firestone in 1933 now known as the mobility analogy. In this analogy electrical impedance is made analogous to mechanical mobility (the inverse of mechanical impedance). Firestone's idea was to make analogous variables that are measured across an element, and make analogous variables that flow through an element. For instance, the \"across\" variable voltage is the analogy of velocity, and the \"through\" variable current is the analogy of force. Firestone's analogy has the advantage of preserving the topology of element connections when converting between domains. A modified form of the through and across analogy was proposed in 1955 by Horace M. Trent and is the modern understanding of \"through and across\".\n\nThe Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time differentiated are equal to the power conjugate variables. The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in Hamiltonian mechanics. The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are charge (\"q\") and flux linkage (λ) because,\n\nIn the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance displacement (\"x\") and momentum (\"p\") because,\n\nThere is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables. The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables. The integrand of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy. For instance,\nare both expressions of energy.\n\nMaxwell's analogy was initially used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains as a single system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an electrical circuit. Vannevar Bush was a pioneer of this kind of modelling in his development of analogue computers, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.\n\nFrom the 1950s onward, manufacturers of mechanical filters, notably Collins Radio, widely used these analogies in order to take the well -developed theory of filter design in electrical engineering and apply it to mechanical systems. The quality of filters required for radio applications could not be achieved with electrical components. Much better quality resonators (higher Q factor) could be made with mechanical parts but there was no equivalent filter theory in mechanical engineering. It was also necessary to have the mechanical parts, the transducers, and the electrical components of the circuit analyzed as a complete system in order to predict the overall response of the filter.\n\nHarry F. Olson helped popularise the use of dynamical analogies in the audio electronics field with his book \"dynamical analogies\" first published in 1943.\n\nA common analogy of magnetic circuits maps magnetomotive force (mmf) to voltage and magnetic flux (φ) to electrical current. However, mmf and φ are not power conjugate variables. The product of these is not in units of power and the ratio, known as magnetic reluctance, does not measure the rate of dissipation of energy so is not a true impedance. Where a compatible analogy is required, mmf can be used as the effort variable and \"dφ/dt\" (rate of change of magnetic flux) will then be the flow variable. This is known as the gyrator-capacitor model.\n\nA widely used analogy in the thermal domain maps temperature difference as the effort variable and thermal power as the flow variable. Again, these are not power conjugate variables, and the ratio, known as thermal resistance, is not really an analogy of either impedance or electrical resistance as far as energy flows are concerned. A compatible analogy could take temperature difference as the effort variable and entropy flow rate as the flow variable.\n\nMany applications of dynamical models convert all energy domains in the system into an electrical circuit and then proceed to analyse the complete system in the electrical domain. There are, however, more generalised methods of representation. One such representation is through the use of bond graphs, introduced by Henry M. Paynter in 1960. It is usual to use the force-voltage analogy (impedance analogy) with bond graphs, but it is not a requirement to do so. Likewise Trent used a different representation (linear graphs) and his representation has become associated with the force-current analogy (mobility analogy), but again this is not mandatory.\n\nSome authors discourage the use of domain specific terminology for the sake of generalisation. For instance, because much of the theory of dynamical analogies arose from electrical theory the power conjugate variables are sometimes called \"V-type\" and \"I-type\" according to whether they are analogs of voltage or current respectively in the electrical domain. Likewise, the Hamiltonian variables are sometimes called \"generalised momentum\" and \"generalised displacement\" according to whether they are analogs of momentum or displacement in the mechanical domain.\n\nA fluid or hydraulic analogy of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry intuitively in terms of plumbing, where water is analogous to the mobile sea of charge within metals, pressure difference is analogous to voltage, and water's flow rate is analogous to electric current.\n\nElectronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called analog computers were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the Norden bombsight could also consist of gears and pulleys in calculation.\n\nExamples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp. 105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and Howard T. Odum (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.\n\nThe process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their lifetime.\n\n\n\n"}

It provides a comprehensive review of 544 skills from 25 skill areas including language, social interaction, self-help, academic and motor skills that most typically developing children acquire prior to entering kindergarten. Expressive language skills are assessed based upon the behavioral analysis of language as presented by Dr. B.F. Skinner in his book, Verbal Behavior (1957). The task items within each skill area are arranged from simpler to more complex tasks. This practical tool facilitates the identification of skills needed by the child to effectively communicate and learn from everyday experiences. The information obtained from this assessment allows parents and professionals to pinpoint obstacles that have been preventing a child from acquiring new skills and to develop a comprehensive language-based curriculum.\nThe ABLLS-R comprises two documents. The ABLLS-R Protocol is used to score the child’s performance on the task items and provides 15 appendices that allow for the tracking of a variety of specific skills that are included in the assessment. The ABLLS-R Guide provides information about the features of the ABLLS-R, how to correctly score items, and how to develop Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives that clearly define and target the learning needs of a student. \n\nThe original version was first released in 1998 by Behavior Analysts, Inc. and was developed by James W. Partington, Ph.D., BCBA-D and Mark L. Sundberg, Ph.D, BCBA-D. It was revised in 2006 by Partington. The revised version incorporates many new task items and provides a more specific sequence in the developmental order of items within the various skill areas. Significant changes were made in the revised version of the vocal imitation section with input from Denise Senick-Pirri, SLP-CCC. Additional improvements were made to incorporate items associated with social interaction skills, motor imitation and other joint attention skills, and to ensure the fluent use of established skills.\n\nThe WebABLLS is an electronic version of the assessment. It allows parents, teachers, speech pathologists, behavior analysts, and others who design, coordinate, or supervise language or skill-acquisition programs to expedite the development of IEPs, progress reports, and to easily share information about a child. The WebABLLS provides videos of many skills that are measured by the ABLLS-R and can be used to demonstrate those specific skills.\n\nOver the past four years, parents, relatives and friends of typically developing children have been participating in an ongoing research project by entering data into the WebABLLS. The data are collected by parents or professionals who both know the children and have received training in the administration of the ABLLS-R. The data are updated at three-month intervals (i.e., 6 months, 9 months, 12 months) in order to track the specific changes in skills over the course of the children’s development. These preliminary data have been collected in a systematic manner to provide information about when each skill measured by the ABLLS-R is usually acquired by typically developing children. \n\nThe preliminary data from this research project are from 81 children (42 females & 39 males) ranging in age from 6 months to 60 months. Children are from a variety of geographical locations (both nationally and internationally) and of differing ethnic, socio-economic and educational backgrounds. The average percent of the total possible scores along with the range from the highest to the lowest scores for the sample at each 3-month age intervals are presented. The data clearly indicate that typically developing children demonstrate most of the basic language and learning skills measured by the ABLLS-R by the time they are 4 to 5 years of age.\n\nWhile the ABLLS-R is most commonly used on children with developmental disabilities and delays (including autism), it can be used for anyone who may be lacking in basic communication or life skills.\n\nIt assesses the strengths and weaknesses of an individual in each of the 25 skill sets. Each skill set is broken down into multiple skills, ordered by typical development or complexity. So, a skill of F1 (Requests by indicating) is a simpler skill than F12 (Requesting Help). \"Usually\", lower level skills are needed before proceeding to teach higher skills. However, many individuals display splinter skills that are above their practical level.\n\nThe ABLLS-R is conducted via observation of the child's behavior in each skill area. The instructor will provide a stimulus to the child (verbal, hand-over-hand, non-verbal, etc.), and, depending on what the child does (the behavior), determines their skill-level. Some skills are difficult or time-consuming to test; instructors frequently accept anecdotal evidence from parents and other instructors as to a child's ability at a given skill-level.\n\nThe ABLLS-R is split into 25 functional areas, each corresponding to a letter in the alphabet. The sections between the ABLLS and ABLLS-R are similar; it is mostly the skills that vary in number and scope.\n\nThe following is a very brief list of advantages and disadvantages to using the ABLLS-R assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mahayana theory contrasts this with the goal of the Theravada path, where the goal is individual arhatship.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, \"Buddha\" refers to one who has become awake through their own efforts and insight, without a teacher to point out the dharma (Sanskrit; Pali \"dhamma\"; \"right way of living\"). A samyaksambuddha teaches the dharma to others after his awakening. A pratyekabuddha also reaches Nirvana through his own efforts, but does not teach the dharma to others. An arhat needs to follow the teaching of a Buddha to attain Nirvana, but can also preach the dharma after attaining Nirvana. In one instance the term buddha is also used in Theravada to refer to all who attain Nirvana, using the term Sāvakabuddha to designate an arhat, someone who depends on the teachings of a Buddha to attain Nirvana. In this broader sense it is equivalent to the arhat.\n\nBuddhahood is the state of an awakened being, who having found the path of cessation of dukkha (\"suffering\", as created by attachment to desires and distorted perception and thinking) is in the state of \"No-more-Learning\".\n\nThere is a broad spectrum of opinion on the universality and method of attainment of Buddhahood, depending on Gautama Buddha's teachings that a school of Buddhism emphasizes. The level to which this manifestation requires ascetic practices varies from none at all to an absolute requirement, dependent on doctrine. Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the bodhisattva ideal instead of the Arhat.\n\nThe Tathagatagarba and Buddha-nature doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism consider Buddhahood to be a universal and innate property of absolute wisdom. This wisdom is revealed in a person's current lifetime through Buddhist practice, without any specific relinquishment of pleasures or \"earthly desires\".\n\nBuddhists do not consider Gautama to have been the only Buddha. The Pāli Canon refers to many previous ones (see list of the named Buddhas), while the Mahayana tradition additionally has many Buddhas of celestial origin (see Amitābha or Vairocana as examples, for lists of many thousands of Buddha names (see \"Taishō Tripiṭaka\" numbers 439–448).\n\nThe various Buddhist schools hold some varying interpretations on the nature of Buddha (see below).\n\nAll Buddhist traditions hold that a Buddha is fully awakened and has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of craving, aversion and ignorance. A Buddha is no longer bound by saṃsāra, and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life.\n\nMost schools of Buddhism have also held that the Buddha was omniscient. However, the early texts contain explicit repudiations of making this claim of the Buddha.\n\nSome Buddhists meditate on (or contemplate) the Buddha as having ten characteristics (Ch./Jp. 十號). These characteristics are frequently mentioned in the Pāli Canon as well as Mahayana teachings, and are chanted daily in many Buddhist monasteries:\n\nThe tenth epithet is sometimes listed as \"The World Honored Enlightened One\" (Skt. \"Buddha-Lokanatha\") or \"The Blessed Enlightened One\" (Skt. \"Buddha-Bhagavan\").\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, Gautama Buddha is known as being a \"teacher of the gods and humans\", superior to both the gods and humans in the sense of having nirvana or the greatest bliss, whereas the devas, or gods, are still subject to anger, fear and sorrow.\n\nIn the Madhupindika Sutta (MN 18), Buddha is described in powerful terms as the Lord of the Dhamma (Pali: Dhammasami, skt.: Dharma Swami) and the bestower of immortality (Pali: Amatassadata).\n\nSimilarly, in the \"Anuradha Sutta\" (SN 44.2) Buddha is described as \nIn the Vakkali Sutta (SN 22.87) Buddha identifies himself with the Dhamma:\nAnother reference from the Aggañña Sutta of the Digha Nikaya, says to his disciple Vasettha:\nShravasti Dhammika, a Theravada monk, writes:\n\nSangharakshita also states that \"The first thing we have to understand - and this is very important - is that the Buddha is a human being. But a special kind of human being, in fact the highest kind, so far as we know.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he was a deva or a human, he replied that he had eliminated the deep-rooted unconscious traits that would make him either one, and should instead be called a Buddha; one who had grown up in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.\n\nAndrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:\n\nHowever, Thích Nhất Hạnh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk in the Zen tradition, states that \"Buddha was not a god. He was a human being like you and me, and he suffered just as we do.\"\n\nJack Maguire writes that Buddha is inspirational based on his humanness.\n\nNichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism states that the real meaning of the Lord Shakyamuni Buddha’s appearance in this world lay in his behavior as a human being.\nIn the early Buddhist schools, the Mahāsāṃghika branch regarded the buddhas as being characterized primarily by their supramundane nature. The Mahāsāṃghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Of the 48 special theses attributed by the \"Samayabhedoparacanacakra\" to the Mahāsāṃghika Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, and the Kukkuṭika, 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to the \"Samayabhedoparacanacakra\", these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind. Yao Zhihua writes:\n\nA doctrine ascribed to the Mahāsāṃghikas is, \"The power of the tathāgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited.\" According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means. For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. \"nirmāṇakāya\"), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the Dharmakāya.\n\nAs in Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions. In the Mahāsāṃghika \"Lokānuvartana Sūtra\", it is stated, \"The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions.\" It is also stated, \"All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma.\" The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the \"Samayabhedoparacanacakra\", which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas.\n\nBuddhas are frequently represented in the form of statues and paintings. Commonly seen designs include:\n\nThe Buddha statue shown calling for rain is a pose common in Laos.\n\nMost depictions of Buddha contain a certain number of \"markings\", which are considered the signs of his enlightenment. These signs vary regionally, but two are common:\n\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, there is frequent mention of a list of thirty-two physical characteristics of the Buddha.\n\nThe poses and hand-gestures of these statues, known respectively as asanas and mudras, are significant to their overall meaning. The popularity of any particular mudra or asana tends to be region-specific, such as the \"Vajra\" (or \"Chi Ken-in\") mudra, which is popular in Japan and Korea but rarely seen in India. Others are more common; for example, the \"Varada\" (Wish Granting) mudra is common among standing statues of the Buddha, particularly when coupled with the \"Abhaya\" (Fearlessness and Protection) mudra.\n\nAśvaghoṣa in his \"Buddhacarita\" gives a long list of names for the Buddha:\nIn his commentary to the \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", Hsuan Hua tells the following fable: \n\n"}
{"id": "13803804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13803804", "title": "Calculation of glass properties", "text": "Calculation of glass properties\n\nThe calculation of glass properties (glass modeling) is used to predict glass properties of interest or glass behavior under certain conditions (e.g., during production) without experimental investigation, based on past data and experience, with the intention to save time, material, financial, and environmental resources, or to gain scientific insight. It was first practised at the end of the 19th century by A. Winkelmann and O. Schott. The combination of several glass models together with other relevant functions can be used for optimization and six sigma procedures. In the form of statistical analysis glass modeling can aid with accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories).\n\nHistorically, the calculation of glass properties is directly related to the founding of glass science. At the end of the 19th century the physicist Ernst Abbe developed equations that allow calculating the design of optimized optical microscopes in Jena, Germany, stimulated by co-operation with the optical workshop of Carl Zeiss. Before Ernst Abbe's time the building of microscopes was mainly a work of art and experienced craftsmanship, resulting in very expensive optical microscopes with variable quality. Now Ernst Abbe knew exactly how to construct an excellent microscope, but unfortunately, the required lenses and prisms with specific ratios of refractive index and dispersion did not exist. Ernst Abbe was not able to find answers to his needs from glass artists and engineers; glass making was not based on science at this time.\n\nIn 1879 the young glass engineer Otto Schott sent Abbe glass samples with a special composition (lithium silicate glass) that he had prepared himself and that he hoped to show special optical properties. Following measurements by Ernst Abbe, Schott's glass samples did not have the desired properties, and they were also not as homogeneous as desired. Nevertheless, Ernst Abbe invited Otto Schott to work on the problem further and to evaluate all possible glass components systematically. Finally, Schott succeeded in producing homogeneous glass samples, and he invented borosilicate glass with the optical properties Abbe needed. These inventions gave rise to the well-known companies Zeiss and Schott Glass (see also Timeline of microscope technology). Systematic glass research was born. In 1908, Eugene Sullivan founded glass research also in the United States (Corning, New York).\n\nAt the beginning of glass research it was most important to know the relation between the glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with \"C\" and \"b\" representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury thermometers. Subsequently, English and Gehlhoff \"et al.\" published similar additive glass property calculation models. Schott’s additivity principle is still widely in use today in glass research and technology.\n\nSchott and many scientists and engineers afterwards applied the additivity principle to experimental data measured in their own laboratory within sufficiently narrow composition ranges (local glass models). This is most convenient because disagreements between laboratories and non-linear glass component interactions do not need to be considered. In the course of several decades of systematic glass research thousands of glass compositions were studied, resulting in millions of published glass properties, collected in glass databases. This huge pool of experimental data was not investigated as a whole, until Bottinga, Kucuk, Priven, Choudhary, Mazurin, and Fluegel published their global glass models, using various approaches. In contrast to the models by Schott the global models consider many independent data sources, making the model estimates more reliable. In addition, global models can reveal and quantify \"non-additive\" influences of certain glass component combinations on the properties, such as the \"mixed-alkali effect\" as seen in the adjacent diagram, or the \"boron anomaly\". Global models also reflect interesting developments of glass property measurement accuracy, e.g., a decreasing accuracy of experimental data in modern scientific literature for some glass properties, shown in the diagram. They can be used for accreditation of new data, experimental procedures, and measurement institutions (glass laboratories). In the following sections (except melting enthalpy) \"empirical\" modeling techniques are presented, which seem to be a successful way for handling huge amounts of experimental data. The resulting models are applied in contemporary engineering and research for the calculation of glass properties.\n\nNon-empirical (\"deductive\") glass models exist. They are often not created to obtain reliable glass property predictions in the first place (except melting enthalpy), but to establish relations among several properties (e.g. atomic radius, atomic mass, chemical bond strength and angles, chemical valency, heat capacity) to gain scientific insight. In future, the investigation of property relations in deductive models may ultimately lead to reliable predictions for all desired properties, provided the property relations are well understood and all required experimental data are available.\n\nGlass properties and glass behavior during production can be calculated through statistical analysis of glass databases such as GE-SYSTEM\nSciGlass and Interglad, \nsometimes combined with the finite element method. For estimating the melting enthalpy thermodynamic databases are used.\n\nIf the desired glass property is not related to crystallization (e.g., liquidus temperature) or phase separation, linear regression can be applied using common polynomial functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree. The \"C\"-values are the glass component concentrations like NaO or CaO in percent or other fractions, the \"b\"-values are coefficients, and \"n\" is the total number of glass components. The glass main component silica (SiO) is excluded in the equation below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%. Many terms in the equation below can be neglected based on correlation and significance analysis. Systematic errors such as seen in the picture are quantified by dummy variables. Further details and examples are available in an online tutorial by Fluegel.\n\nThe liquidus temperature has been modeled by non-linear regression using neural networks and disconnected peak functions. The disconnected peak functions approach is based on the observation that within one primary crystalline phase field linear regression can be applied and at eutectic points sudden changes occur.\n\nThe glass melting enthalpy reflects the amount of energy needed to convert the mix of raw materials (batch) to a melt glass. It depends on the batch and glass compositions, on the efficiency of the furnace and heat regeneration systems, the average residence time of the glass in the furnace, and many other factors. A pioneering article about the subject was written by Carl Kröger in 1953.\n\nFor modeling of the glass flow in a glass melting furnace the finite element method is applied commercially, based on data or models for viscosity, density, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, absorption spectra, and other relevant properties of the glass melt. The finite element method may also be applied to glass forming processes.\n\nIt is often required to optimize several glass properties simultaneously, including production costs.\n\nIt is possible to weight the desired properties differently. Basic information about the principle can be found in an article by Huff \"et al.\" The combination of several glass models together with further relevant technological and financial functions can be used in six sigma optimization.\n\n"}

Walker to explain patterns of behavior in an abusive relationship.\n\nLenore E. Walker interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to domestic violence and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the \"cycle of abuse\". Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling patriarchal behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. Her terms \"the battering cycle\" and \"battered woman syndrome\" has since been largely eclipsed by \"cycle of abuse\" and \"battered person syndrome\", respectively, for many reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn't always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, \"The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women.\"\n\nThe cycle of abuse concept is widely used in domestic violence programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.\n\nThe cycle usually goes in the following order, and will repeat until the conflict is stopped, usually by the survivor entirely abandoning the relationship or some form of intervention. The cycle can occur hundreds of times in an abusive relationship, the total cycle taking anywhere from a few hours, to a year or more to complete. However, the length of the cycle usually diminishes over time so that the \"reconciliation\" and \"calm\" stages may disappear, violence becomes more intense and the cycles become more frequent.\n\nStress builds from the pressures of daily life, like conflict over children, marital issues, misunderstandings, or other family conflicts. It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war. During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged. The feeling lasts on average several minutes to hours, it may last as much as several months.\n\nTo prevent violence, the victim may try to reduce the tension by becoming compliant and nurturing. Or, to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury, the victim may provoke the batterer. \"However, at no time is the batterer justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior,\" said Scott Allen Johnson, author of \"Physical Abusers and Sexual Offenders\".\n\nCharacterized by outbursts of violent, abusive incidents which may be preceded by verbal abuse and include psychological abuse. During this stage the abuser attempts to dominate their partner (survivor) with the use of domestic violence.\n\nIn intimate partner violence, children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence and the partner's relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim \"had it coming\" to them.\n\nThe perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.\n\nCharacterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually shower the survivor with love and affection. The abuser may use self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.\n\nDuring this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceable. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counseling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex. Over time, the batterer's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention. However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase. The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.\n\nWalker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence, which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the \"escalation\" or tension building stage, which includes triggers, the victim feeling victimized, angry and depressed, isolation and revenge planning. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.\n\nDonald Dutton and Susan Golant agree that Walker's cycle of abuse accurately describes all cyclically abusive relationships they studied. Nonetheless, they also note that her initial research was based almost entirely on anecdotal data from a rather small set of women who were in violent relationships. Walker herself wrote, \"These women were not randomly selected and they cannot be considered a legitimate data base from which to make specific generalizations.\"\n\n\n"}

Thus, mind is the cause of the universe and not the subtle cosmic elements; mind which is consciousness creates the world. This doctrine is aligned with the doctrine of \"Ajatavada\", that of 'non-causality'.\n\nShankara did not see subjectivism as a natural consequence of Mayavada, but much later a kind of subjective idealism was introduced by Prakasananda. Prakasananda propounded his doctrine of \"Drishti-srishti-vada\" in his work titled, \"Siddhanta-Muktavali\", on which Nana Dikshita had written a commentary called \"Siddhanta-pradipika\". In so doing he denied the objective character of maya. According to him all phenomena are subjective or imagined, and exist so long as are perceived. In this context, Madhusudana in his \"Siddhanta-bindu\" explains that Ishvara is Pure consciousness Brahman afflicted by nescience, and the reflection of consciousness in nescience is the jiva who is himself thus the material and efficient cause of the universe through his own nescience.\n\nRamana termed this concept as the 'doctrine of simultaneous creation' or as the 'theory of false appearance', which theory maintains that all objects depend for their apparent existence upon the seer; that the world only exists when it is perceived, i.e. with the appearance of I-thought.\n"}
{"id": "234771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234771", "title": "Embarrassment", "text": "Embarrassment\n\nEmbarrassment or awkwardness is an emotional state that is associated with mild to severe levels of discomfort, and which is usually experienced when someone has a socially unacceptable or frowned-upon act or condition that was witnessed by or revealed to others.\n\nUsually some perception of loss of honor or dignity (or other high-value ideals) is involved, but the embarrassment level and the type depends on the situation. Embarrassment is similar to shame in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself. Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than morally wrong.\n\nEmbarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen nude or in underwear is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see modesty). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation—such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behaviour, discovering one is the victim of gossip, being rejected by another person (see also humiliation), being made the focus of attention (e.g., birthday celebrants, newlyweds), or even witnessing someone else's embarrassment.\n\nPersonal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of blushing, sweating, nervousness, stammering, and fidgeting. Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or nervous laughter, especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of anger depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even humorous, to intense apprehension or fear.\n\nThe idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman (1967) who argued the embarrassed individual \"demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time\". Semin & Manstead (1982) demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the \"bad act\") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned – regardless of restitution behaviour (rebuilding the display). The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour – for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviours. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviour was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys (Ketlner et al. 1995). Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behaviour that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.\n\nEmbarrassment can also be professional or official, especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence. Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life. Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behaviour, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see Space Shuttle Challenger).\n\nNot all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved. For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result. By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see Hwang Woo-Suk) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community. Professional or official embarrassment is often accompanied by public expressions of anger, denial of involvement, or attempts to minimize the consequences. Sometimes the embarrassed entity issues press statements, removes or distance themselves from sub-level employees, attempts to carry on as if nothing happened, suffers income loss, emigrates, or vanishes from public view.\n\nVicarious embarrassment is an embarrassed feeling from observing the embarrassing actions of another person. People who rate themselves as more empathic are more likely to experience vicarious embarrassment. The effect is present whether or not the observed party is aware of the embarrassing nature of their actions, although awareness generally increases the strength of the felt vicarious embarrassment, as does an accidental (as opposed to intentional) action.\n\nOne typology of embarrassment is described by Sharkey and Stafford. There are six types of embarrassment: \n\nAnother typology, by Cupach and Metts, discusses the dimensions of intended-unintended and appropriate-inappropriate behavior, and four basic types of embarrassing circumstances: \n\nBased on these types, Cupach and Metts classify two basic embarrassment situations: the actor responsible and the observer responsible. Actor responsible situations are embarrassing when a person executes an act that is either inappropriate to a point of proficiency matching social norms and expectations, inconsistent with role expectations, or is out-of-sync with a social identity. The observer responsible categories are embarrassing when an individual becomes the focus of attention through:\n\nThe first known written occurrence of \"embarrass\" in English was in 1664 by Samuel Pepys in his diary. The word derives from the French word \"embarrasser\", \"to block\" or \"obstruct\", whose first recorded usage was by Michel de Montaigne in 1580. The French word was derived from the Spanish \"embarazar\", whose first recorded usage was in 1460 in \"Cancionero de Stúñiga\" (Songbook of Stúñiga) by Álvaro de Luna. The Spanish word comes from the Portuguese \"embaraçar\", which is a combination of the prefix \"em-\" (from Latin \"im-\" for \"in-\") with \"baraço\" or \"baraça\", \"a noose\" or \"rope\". \"Baraça\" originated before the Romans began their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC. Thus, \"baraça\" could be related to the Celtic word \"barr\", \"tuft\". (Celtic people actually settled much of Spain and Portugal beginning in the 8th century BC) However, it certainly is not directly derived from it, as the substitution of \"r\" for \"rr\" in Ibero-Romantic languages was not a known occurrence.\n\nThe Spanish word may come from the Italian \"imbarazzare\", from \"imbarazzo\", \"obstacle\" or \"obstruction\". That word came from \"imbarrare\", \"to block\" or \"bar\", which is a combination of \"in-\", \"in\" with \"barra\", \"bar\" (from the Vulgar Latin \"barra\", which is of unknown origin). The problem with this theory is that the first known usage of the word in Italian was by Bernardo Davanzati (1529–1606), long after the word had entered Spanish.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1194555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1194555", "title": "Exotheology", "text": "Exotheology\n\nThe term \"exotheology\" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s for the examination of theological issues as they pertain to extraterrestrial intelligence. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies have been or will be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.\n\nOne of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a soul, as a thought experiment to the examination of a given theology, mostly Christian theology, occasionally also Jewish theology.\n\nA Christian writer early to address the question was C. S. Lewis (1898–1963) who in a 1950s article in the \"Christian Herald\" contemplated the possibility of the Son of God incarnating in other, extraterrestrial, worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one applicable to humans.\nLutheran theologian Ted Peters (2003) asserts that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are by no means new to Christian theology and by no means pose, as asserted by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters points out that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of \"what if God had created many worlds?\", as early as the discussion of the Antipodes by the Church Fathers.\n\nThe Catholic Vatican theologian Corrado Balducci often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement \"UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?\".\nIn a 2008 statement, José Gabriel Funes, head of the Vatican Observatory, said\n\"Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom\".\n\nSmaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: Christian Science and the Course in Miracles treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, \"The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings...\", and Emanuel Swedenborg wrote, \"Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?\"\n\nWhile other Protestant denominations have tended to be somewhat terracentric, much as Roman Catholicism was until more recent times, receptivity to the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations likely depends on the degree of associated biblical literalism. Those of more fundamentalist leanings as interviewed occasionally on UFO- and paranormal-themed radio shows like Coast to Coast AM often try to fit extraterrestrial beings into the mold of demons or Nephilim, lacking much better category in which to place them, whereas schools of less literal persuasion would be more open to alternative perspectives. These would include either fundamental reexamination of traditional assumptions, some reconsideration of extraterrestrials as in some sense angels, or at least wider interpretations possible in the saying ascribed to Jesus of Nazareth, \"And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\", which while probably quite presumptuous-sounding in the very large cosmic perspective could potentially lend itself to a reading in some more impersonal sense as well better befitting the larger magnitude of exotheology.\n\nRabbi Aryeh Kaplan, who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing various classic Jewish authorities. Among them are the medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). After presenting his sources, Rabbi Kaplan remarks, \"We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility\"—at least in the same sense as human beings.\nRabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 (\"Cursed is Meroz...\"), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator remarks, \"Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene].\" (The basis of Rashi's comment is a Talmudic discussion in tractate Moed Katan 16a. However, the verse in Judges is more commonly understood as a literary usage by Deborah the Prophetess and not an affirmation of possible intelligent life on another planet.)\n\nRabbi Norman Lamm, former chancellor of Yeshiva University, has also written on this subject, asserting that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.\n\nRabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, an eminent 20th century Talmudic authority and rabbinical leader, is cited as having been open-minded about extraterrestrial life. He is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.\n\nDepending on the suras cited, the Quran of Islam appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on a par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a heaven or hell as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.\n\n\n"}

The best English translation may be \"cheesy\" or \"tacky\". \"Norsk ordbok\" defines \"harry\" as \"tasteless, vulgar\".\n\nThe term \"harry\" was first used by upper class youth in Oslo in the beginning of the 20th century, and was used to describe people who belonged to the working class. People in the lower social classes at the time often gave their children English first names such as Harry. The middle and upper classes mostly preferred Scandinavian or German (and occasionally French) names. English names (except English names that are also widely found in other European languages) had no tradition in Scandinavia and were generally considered bad taste and as a phenomenon of the working-class of the time in all the Scandinavian countries. The traditional elite of Norway mostly used conservative Danish names.\n\nA person who is \"harry\" is often perceived as unsophisticated, vulgar or with bad taste. The effect of bad taste is often characterized with the term \"harry\", e.g. a \"harry\" dress or a \"harry\" car. Since the definition of good and bad taste is defined by fashion, there is no precise definition of \"harry\". D.D.E., Sputnik, shopping in Sweden, Raggare culture and mullets are often mentioned today. In the 1970s it was the 1960s' hairwax or sharp shoes that were harry. In the 1980s the 1970s' flared pants or whiskers, and in the 1990s more or less everything that could be associated with the 1980s. Yesterday's fashion will often be interpreted as harry. Often what is harry in one period can be hip retro fashion the next year.\n\nHarry may also be interpreted as something like macho. The feminine parallel is \"doris\".\n\nThe term was repopularised by then minister of Agriculture Lars Sponheim in 2002 to describe Norwegians who drive (in some cases, for hours) to reach and cross the border to Sweden in order to purchase groceries, tobacco and alcohol at cheaper prices. Responses to this were retorts that seeking out bargains is smart shopping, and Swedish shops introduced humorous campaigns with one shopkeeper giving 1000 SEK to customers named \"Harry\". The terms \"Harrytur\" (\"Harry trip\") or \"Harryhandel\" (\"Harry trade\") have since been popular descriptions of this trade.\n\n\n"}

It also imparts and spreads out the human rights vocabulary and provides a critical approach towards human rights.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for the Promotion and Protection of all Human Rights functions as coordinator of the UN Education and Public Information Programs in the area of human rights.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed it as central to the achievement of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):\n\nArticle 26.2 of the UDHR states the role of educators in achieving the social order called for by the declaration:\n\nArticle 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires states to ensure that children are enabled to develop a respect for their own cultural identity, language and values and for the culture, language and values of others.\n\nThe importance of human rights was reaffirmed by the United Nations in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action:\n\nAs a result of the Vienna Declaration the decade from 1995 to 2004 was declared the \"UN Decade of Human Rights Education\".\n\nUNESCO has a responsibility to promote human rights education, and was a key organiser of the UN's Decade for Human Rights Education. UNESCO attempts to promote human rights education through:\n\n\nFollowing the Decade of Human Rights Education, on 10 December 2004, the General Assembly proclaimed the \"World Programme for Human Rights Education\", and ongoing project to advance the implementation of human rights education programmes in all sectors:\n\nThe emphasis on Human Rights Education began in 1995 with the beginning of the UN Decade for Human Rights Education, though previously addressed in 1953 with the UNESCO Associated Schools Program, which served as an “initial attempt to teach human rights in formal school settings”. The first formal request for the need to educate students about human rights came about in UNESCO’s 1974 article Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Cooperation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The participants of the International Congress on the Teaching of Humans Rights eventually met in 1978 to form a specific definition of what would be required application of the education in formal curricula. The aims at which the Congress agreed upon including the encouragement of tolerant attitudes with focus on respect, providing knowledge of human rights in the context of national and international dimensions as well as their implementations, and finally developing awareness of human rights translating into reality whether social or political on national and international levels.\n\nHuman Rights Education became an official central concern internationally after the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. This conference brought the issue of educating formally to the top of many countries’ priority lists and was brought to the attention of the United Nations. It was two years later that the United Nations approved the Decade for Human Rights Education, which reformed the aims of application once again. Since the development of the UN Decade, the incorporation of human rights education into formal school curricula has been developed and diversified with the assistance of nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and individuals dedicated to spreading the topic through formal education.\n\nToday the most influential document used to determine what qualifies as human rights and how to implement these ideas and rights into everyday life is the Universal Declaration. The declaration was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, making December 10 annual Human Rights Day ever since. To this day the 30 article compilation is seen as “a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”.\n\nArab Institute for Human Rights\nThe Arab Institute for Human Rights is an independent Arab non-governmental\norganization based in Tunisia.

Amnesty International defines Human Rights Education as a “deliberate, participatory practice aimed at empowering individuals, groups and communities through fostering knowledge, skills and attitudes consistent with internationally recognized human rights principles”.\n\nHuman Rights organizations aim to protect human rights on different levels some being more specific to geographical areas, others are based on governmental influences, others are nonprofit and education based, while others specifically aim to protect a certain group of individuals. The following are organizations with brief descriptions of their aims, targeted audiences, and affiliations.\n\nAccording to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), each submission whether private or public, governmental or NGO is evaluated with regards to the following context: appropriateness, effectiveness, originality, ease of use, adaptability, sustainability, approach, and inclusiveness.

The model is incorporated by means of training and networking, covering topics such as court cases, codes of ethics, and how to deal with the media.\n\n3. Transformational \nThis model of education focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of human rights. The topics towards which this model is effective are those including vulnerable populations and people with personal experiences effected by the topic, such as women and minorities. The model aims to empower the individual, such as those victims of abuse and trauma. The model is geared towards recognizing the abuse of human rights but is also committed to preventing these abuses.\n\nSudbury model of democratic education schools maintain that values, human rights included, must be learned through experience as Aristotle said: \"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.\" They adduce that for this purpose schools must encourage ethical behavior and personal responsibility. In order to achieve these goals schools must respect human rights in school by allowing students the three great freedoms—freedom of choice, freedom of action and freedom to bear the results of action—that constitute personal responsibility.\n\n\n\n"}

Created by Pascal Gemperli and Uri Ziegele in 2007, the organization focuses on promoting conflict transformation and peacebuilding through peace mediation courses and trainings. Its comprehensive approach is based on interdisciplinary practice and research in the areas of international peace and conflict research, critical systems theory, culture and communication studies, political psychology, group psychotherapy and other related fields. The ICP has offices in both Bern and Morges (Switzerland). It is accredited ECOSOC and certified EDUQUA. It is active in the following countries: Switzerland, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe ICP offers mediation services on the one hand, and organizes peace mediation trainings and workshops on the other hand. Hence it is active both in mediation and in the promotion of peacebuilding through education, in Switzerland and abroad.\n\nThe ICP holds a Konfliktbüro (conflict office) in Bern. The office proposes mediation services to enterprises, institutions and administrations as well as to individuals. The advanced training Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung (The Art of Conflict Transformation) is recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations (SDM-FSM) and organized in partnership with the University of Basel.\n\nEvery summer since 2008, the ICP organizes the International Summer Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue, which is a mediation and peacebuilding training taking place in Caux (Montreux, Switzerland). This one-week course allows participants to attend classes about peace mediation and to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of international experts in the field. Participants also acquire practical skills through peace mediation simulations. Each year, the focus of the course changes slightly: new topics are introduced and other perspectives presented. Participants in the Summer Academy can also decide to attend the International Peace-builders' Forum, which takes place in Caux, usually just before the beginning of the Summer Academy.\n\nThe Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding is jointly involved with the Universities of Basel, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the creation of a regional Master in Peace Studies in South-East Europe \n\n"}

They include: intellectual responsibility, perseverance, open-mindedness, empathy, integrity, intellectual courage, confidence in reason, love of truth, intellectual humility, imaginativeness, curiosity, fair-mindedness, and autonomy. So-called virtue responsibilists conceive of intellectual virtues primarily as acquired character traits, such as intellectual conscientiousness and love of knowledge. Virtue reliabilists, by contrast, think of intellectual virtues more in terms of well-functioning mental faculties such as perception, memory, and intuition. Intellectual virtues are studied extensively in both critical thinking and virtue epistemology.\n\nAristotle analyzed virtues into moral and intellectual virtues. In the \"Posterior Analytics\" and \"Nicomachean Ethics\" he identified five intellectual virtues as the five ways the soul arrives at truth by affirmation or denial.

October 11, 2012, was the first Day of the Girl Child. The observation supports more opportunity for girls and increases awareness of gender inequality faced by girls worldwide based upon their gender. This inequality includes areas such as access to education, nutrition, legal rights, medical care, and protection from discrimination, violence against women and forced child marriage. The celebration of the day also \"reflects the successful emergence of girls and young women as a distinct cohort in development policy, programming, campaigning and research.\"\n\nInternational Day of the Girl increases awareness of issues faced by girls around the world. Many global development plans do not include or consider girls, and their issues become \"invisible.\" More than 62 million girls around the world have no access to education. Worldwide and collectively, girls ages 5 to 14 spend more than 160 million hours more on household chores than boys of the same age do. Globally, one in four girls are married before age 18. On October 11, 2016, Emma Watson, who is also the United Nations Women's Goodwill Ambassador, urged countries and families worldwide to end child marriage. Many girls around the world are vulnerable to acts of sexual violence and the perpetrators often go unpunished.\n\nThe Day of Girls helps raise awareness not only of the issues that girls face, but also what is likely to happen when those problems are solved. For example, educating girls helps reduce the rate of child marriage, disease and helps strengthen the economy by helping girls have access to higher paying jobs.\n\nThe International Day of Girls initiative began as a project of Plan International, a non-governmental organization that operates worldwide. The idea for an international day of observance and celebration grew out of Plan International's Because I Am a Girl campaign, which raises awareness of the importance of nurturing girls globally and in developing countries in particular. Plan International representatives in Canada approached the Canadian federal government to seek to the coalition of supporters raised awareness of the initiative internationally. Eventually, Plan International urged the United Nations to become involved.\n\nInternational Day of Girls was formally proposed as a resolution by Canada in the United Nations General Assembly. Rona Ambrose, Canada's Minister for the Status of Women, sponsored the resolution; a delegation of women and girls made presentations in support of the initiative at the 55th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. On December 19, 2011, the United Nations General Assembly voted to pass a resolution adopting October 11, 2012 as the inaugural International Day of Girls. The resolution states that the Day of Girls recognizes \n\nEach year's Day of Girls has a theme; the first was \"ending child marriage\", the second, in 2013, was \"innovating for girls' education\", the third, in 2014, was \"Empowering Adolescent Girls: Ending the Cycle of Violence,\" and the fourth, in 2015, was \"The Power of Adolescent Girl: Vision for 2030.\" The 2016 theme was \"Girls' Progress = Goals' Progress: What Counts for Girls,\" the 2017 theme was \"EmPOWER Girls: Before, during and after crises,\" and the theme for 2018 was “With Her: A Skilled Girl Force.”\n\nBy 2013, worldwide, there were around 2,043 events for Day of Girls.\n\nVarious events to promote the Day of Girls are planned in several countries. Some are sponsored by the United Nations, such as a concert in Mumbai, India. Non-governmental organizations, such as Girl Guides Australia, also support events and activities for International Day of Girls. Local organizations have developed their own events, such as Girls and Football South Africa, who, in 2012, distributed T-shirts on International Day of Girls to commemorate the 1956 Black Sash march by 20,000 women. An all-day event was held on London's South Bank in 2013, which included theatre and film performances produced by Body Gossip, an organisation that campaigns on body image and mental health issues. For the first Day of Girls, a virtual event was developed by Sage Girl and iTwixie to bring thousands of individuals and organizations together online.\n\nIn 2016, London held a Women of the World (WOW) festival where 250 London school-aged girls were paired with women mentors.

{"id": "251223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251223", "title": "John Toland", "text": "John Toland\n\nJohn Toland (30 November 1670 – 11 March 1722) was an Irish rationalist philosopher and freethinker, and occasional satirist, who wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political philosophy and philosophy of religion, which are early expressions of the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment. Born in Ireland, he was educated at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leiden and Oxford and was influenced by the philosophy of John Locke.\n\nHis first, and best known work, was \"Christianity not Mysterious\" (1696).\n\nVery little is known of Toland's early life. He was born in Ardagh on the Inishowen Peninsula, a predominantly Catholic and Irish-speaking region in northwestern Ireland. His parents are unknown. He would later write that he had been baptised \"Janus Junius\", a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god Janus and Junius Brutus, reputed founder of the Roman republic. According to his biographer Pierre des Maizeaux, he adopted the name John as a schoolboy with the encouragement of his school teacher.\n\nHaving formally converted from Catholicism to Protestantism at the age of 16, Toland got a scholarship to study theology at the University of Glasgow. In 1690, at age 19, the University of Edinburgh conferred a master's degree on him. He then got a scholarship to spend two years studying at University of Leiden in Holland, and subsequently nearly two years at Oxford in England (1694–95). The Leiden scholarship had been provided by wealthy English Dissenters, who hoped Toland would go on to become a minister for Dissenters.\n\nIn Toland's first book \"Christianity not Mysterious\" (1696), he argued that the divine revelation of the Bible contains no true mysteries; rather, all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly trained reason from natural principles. For this argument he was prosecuted by a grand jury in London. As he was a subject of the Kingdom of Ireland, members of the Parliament of Ireland proposed that he should be burnt at the stake, and in his absence three copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in Dublin as the content was contrary to the core doctrines of the Church of Ireland. Toland bitterly compared the Protestant legislators to \"Popish Inquisitors who performed that Execution on the Book, when they could not seize the Author, whom they had destined to the Flames\".\n\nAfter his departure from Oxford Toland resided in London for most of the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on the Continent from 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722. The \"1911 Encyclopædia Britannica\" says of him that at his death in London at age 51 \"he died... as he had lived, in great poverty, in the midst of his books, with his pen in his hand.\" Just before he died, he composed his own epitaph: \"He was an assertor of liberty, a lover of all sorts of learning ... but no man’s follower or dependent. Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline from the ways he had chosen.\"\n\nVery shortly after his death a lengthy biography of Toland was written by Pierre des Maizeaux.\n\nJohn Toland was the first person called a freethinker (by Bishop Berkeley) and went on to write over a hundred books in various domains but mostly dedicated to criticising ecclesiastical institutions. A great deal of his intellectual activity was dedicated to writing political tracts in support of the Whig cause. Many scholars know him for his role as either the biographer or editor of notable republicans from the mid-17th century such as James Harrington, Algernon Sidney and John Milton. His works \"Anglia Libera\" and \"State Anatomy\" are prosaic expressions of an English republicanism which reconciles itself with constitutional monarchy.\nAfter \"Christianity Not Mysterious\", Toland's views became gradually more radical. His opposition to hierarchy in the church also led to opposition to hierarchy in the state; bishops and kings, in other words, were as bad as each other, and monarchy had no God-given sanction as a form of government. In his 1704 \"Letters to Serena\" – in which he used the expression 'pantheism' – he carefully analyses the manner by which truth is arrived at, and why people are prone to forms of 'false consciousness.'\n\nIn politics his most radical proposition was that liberty was a defining characteristic of what it means to be human. Political institutions should be designed to guarantee freedom, not simply to establish order. For Toland, reason and tolerance were the twin pillars of the good society. This was Whiggism at its most intellectually refined, the very antithesis of the Tory belief in sacred authority in both church and state. Toland's belief in the need for perfect equality among free-born citizens was extended to the Jewish community, tolerated, but still outsiders in early 18th century England. In his 1714 \"Reasons for Naturalising the Jews\" he was the first to advocate full citizenship and equal rights for Jewish people.\n\nToland's world was not all detached intellectual speculation, though. There was also an incendiary element to his political pamphleteering, and he was not beyond whipping up some of the baser anti-Catholic sentiments of the day in his attacks on the Jacobites.\n\nHe also produced some highly controversial polemics, including the \"Treatise of the Three Impostors\", in which Christianity, Judaism and Islam are all condemned as the three great political frauds. The \"Treatise of the Three Imposters\" was rumoured to exist in manuscript form since the Middle Ages and excoriated throughout all of Europe. It is now thought that the work did not exist.\n\nToland claimed to have a personal copy of the manuscript which he passed to the circle of Jean Rousset in France. Rumours that it was then translated into French were taken seriously by some: however, not by Voltaire who issued a satirical reply.\n\nHis republican sympathies were also evidenced by his editing of the writings of some of the great radicals of the 1650s, including James Harrington, Algernon Sydney, Edmund Ludlow and John Milton. In his support for the Hanoverian monarchy he somewhat moderated his republican sentiments; though his ideal kingship was one that would work towards achieving civic virtue and social harmony, a 'just liberty' and the 'preservation and improvement of our reason.' But George I and the oligarchy behind Walpole were about as far from Toland's ideal as it is possible to get. In many ways he was thus a man born both too late and too early.\n\nToland influenced Baron d'Holbach's ideas about physical motion. In his \"Letters to Serena\", Toland claimed that rest, or absence of motion, is not merely relative. Actually, for Toland, rest is a special case of motion. When there is a conflict of forces, the body that is apparently at rest is influenced by as much activity and passivity as it would be if it were moving.\n\nToland identified himself as a pantheist in his publication \"Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist\" in 1705. At the time when he wrote \"Christianity not Mysterious\" he was careful to distinguish himself from both sceptical atheists and orthodox theologians. After having formulated a stricter version of Locke's epistemological rationalism, Toland then goes on to show that there are no facts or doctrines from the Bible which are not perfectly plain, intelligible and reasonable, being neither contrary to reason nor incomprehensible to it. All revelation is human revelation; that which is not rendered understandable is to be rejected as gibberish.\n\nHowever, David Berman has argued for an atheistic reading of Toland, demonstrating contradictions between \"Christianity not Mysterious\" and Toland's \"Two Essays\" (London, 1695). Berman's reading of Toland and Charles Blount attempts to show that Toland deliberately obscured his real atheism so as to avoid prosecution whilst attempting to subliminally influence unknowing readers, specifically by creating contradictions in his work which can only be resolved by reducing Toland's God to a pantheistic one, and realising that such a non-providential God is, for Blount, Toland and Colins, \"...no God, or as good as no God...In short, the God of theism is \"blictri\" for Toland; only the determined material God of pantheism exists, and he (or it) is really no God.\"\n\nAfter his \"Christianity not Mysterious\", Toland's \"Letters to Serena\" constitute his major contribution to philosophy. In the first three letters, he develops a historical account of the rise of superstition arguing that human reason cannot ever fully liberate itself from prejudices. In the last two letters, he founds a metaphysical materialism grounded in a critique of monist substantialism. Later on, we find Toland continuing his critique of church government in \"Nazarenus\" which was first more fully developed in his \"Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church\", a clandestine writing in circulation by 1705. The first book of \"Nazarenus\" calls attention to the right of the Ebionites to a place in the early church. The thrust of his argument was to push to the very limits the applicability of canonical scripture to establish institutionalised religion. Later works of special importance include Tetradymus wherein can be found Clidophorus, a historical study of the distinction between esoteric and exoteric philosophies.\n\nHis \"Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae\" (Pantheisticon, or the Form of Celebrating the Socratic Society), of which he printed a few copies for private circulation only, gave great offence as a sort of liturgic service made up of passages from pagan authors, in imitation of the Church of England liturgy. The title also was in those days alarming, and still more so the mystery which the author threw around the question how far such societies of pantheists actually existed. The term \"pantheism\" was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of Spinoza.\n\nToland was famous for distinguishing exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke's \"Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox\" presented an analysis of Toland's 'exoteric strategy' of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland's philosophy and theology had little to do with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland's practices to Shaftesbury's conception of a comic or 'derisory' mode of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.\n\nToland was a man not of his time; one who advocated principles of virtue in duty, principles that had little place in the England of Robert Walpole, governed by cynicism and self-interest. His intellectual reputation, moreover, was subsequently eclipsed by the likes of John Locke and David Hume, and still more by Montesquieu and the French radical thinkers. Edmund Burke in his \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" wrote dismissively of Toland and his fellows: \"Who, born within the last 40 years, has read one word of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers?\"\n\nStill, in \"Christianity not Mysterious\", the book for which he is best known, Toland laid down a challenge not just to the authority of the established church, but to all inherited and unquestioned authority. It was thus as radical politically and philosophically, as it was theologically.\n\nOf his influence, humanities professor Robert Pattison wrote: \"Two centuries earlier the establishment would have burned him as a heretic; two centuries later it would have made him a professor of comparative religion in a California university. In the rational Protestant climate of early 18th-century Britain, he was merely ignored to death.\"\n\nHowever, Toland managed to find success after his death: Thomas Hollis, the great 18th century book collector and editor, commissioned the London bookseller Andrew Millar to publish works advocating republican government - a list of titles which included Toland's work in 1760. \n\n\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list (and it does not clearly distinguish pamphlets from books):\n\n"}

Douglas as the most disturbing individual for whom he has ever created a criminal profile, Bittaker was sentenced to death for five murders on March 24, 1981, and is currently on death row at San Quentin State Prison.\n\nNorris accepted a plea bargain whereby he agreed to testify against Bittaker and was sentenced to life imprisonment on May 7, 1980, with possibility of parole after serving 30 years. He is currently incarcerated at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility.\n\nBittaker and Norris became known as the \"Tool Box Killers\" due to the fact the majority of instruments used to torture and murder their victims, such as pliers, ice picks, and sledgehammers, were items normally stored inside a household toolbox.\n\nLawrence Sigmund Bittaker was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on September 27, 1940, as the unwanted child of a couple who had chosen to not have children. Bittaker was placed in an orphanage by his natural mother and was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. George Bittaker as an infant. Bittaker's adoptive father worked in the aviation industry, which required the family to frequently move around the United States throughout his childhood.\n\nBittaker was first arrested for shoplifting at the age of 12 and obtained a minor criminal record over the next four years after further arrests for the same offense—in addition to petty theft—which brought him to the attention of juvenile authorities. Bittaker would later claim these numerous theft-related offenses committed throughout his adolescence had been attempts to compensate for the lack of love he received from his parents.\n\nAlthough reported to have an IQ of 138, Bittaker considered school a tedious experience and dropped out of high school in 1957. By this stage in his adolescence, he and his adoptive parents were living in California. Within a year of dropping out, he had been arrested for car theft, a hit and run, and evading arrest. For these offenses he was imprisoned at the California Youth Authority, where he remained until he was 18 years old. Upon release, Bittaker discovered his adoptive parents had disowned him and had relocated to another state. He would never see his adoptive parents again.\n\nRoy Lewis Norris was born in Greeley, Colorado, on February 5, 1948. Norris was conceived out of wedlock; his parents had married to avoid the social stigma surrounding illegitimate birth at the time.\n\nNorris' family lived within a short distance of his parents' home due to his grandfather's real estate investments. His father worked in a scrapyard and his mother was a drug-addicted housewife. He occasionally lived with his parents throughout his childhood and adolescence but was repeatedly placed in the care of foster families throughout the state of Colorado.\n\nNorris' childhood recollections are interspersed with memories of wrongful accusations while living with his biological parents, and being neglected by many of the foster families he lived with, frequently being denied sufficient food or clothing. He also claims he was sexually abused when in the care of a Hispanic family and later went on to state that this is where his prejudice towards Hispanics originates from.\n\nWhile living with his birth parents at the age of 16, Norris visited the home of a female relative who was in her early twenties and began speaking to her in a sexually suggestive manner. She ordered him to leave her house and informed Norris' father, who threatened to subject him to a beating. Norris subsequently stole his father's car and drove into the Rocky Mountains, where he attempted to commit suicide by injecting pure air into an artery in his arm. He was later apprehended as a runaway, and returned to live with his parents. Upon his return home, Norris's parents informed him that he and his younger sister were unwanted children and that they intended to divorce when both reached adolescence.\n\nA year later Norris dropped out of school and joined the United States Navy. He was stationed in San Diego in 1965 and was deployed to Vietnam in 1969, although he did not see active combat during his four-month tour of duty. While stationed in Vietnam, he experimented with heroin and marijuana, becoming a regular user of the latter. He was honorably discharged from the Navy after one tour of duty.\n\nWithin days of his parole from the California Youth Authority, Bittaker was arrested for transporting a stolen vehicle across state lines. In August 1959, Bittaker was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, to be served in the Oklahoma State Reformatory. He was later transferred to the medical center for federal prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, to serve the remainder of his sentence.\n\nIn 1960, Bittaker was released from prison and soon reverted to crime. Within months of his release, he had been arrested in Los Angeles for robbery and, in May 1961, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. While incarcerated for this robbery, he was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as being highly manipulative. The psychiatrist also described Bittaker as \"having considerable concealed hostility.\"\n\nBittaker was released on parole in 1963 after completing two years of his sentence. In October 1964, he was again imprisoned for parole violation. In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, both of whom classified him as a borderline psychopath: a highly manipulative individual unable to acknowledge the consequences of his actions. Bittaker explained to one of them that his criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters pertaining to his environment and upbringing decreased his ability to resist committing crimes. Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. A year later, he was again released into society.\n\nA month after his parole in July 1967, Bittaker was again arrested and convicted of theft and of leaving the scene of an accident. He was sentenced to five years but was released in April 1970. In March 1971, Bittaker was again arrested for burglary. Due to repeated parole violations, he was sentenced to 6 months to 15 years' imprisonment in October 1971. Three years later, Bittaker was again released from prison.\n\nIn 1974, Bittaker was arrested for assault with attempt to commit murder, after he stabbed a young supermarket employee who had accused him of stealing. The supermarket employee had observed Bittaker stealing a steak and had followed Bittaker outside and into the store's parking lot, where he calmly asked Bittaker whether he had forgotten to pay. Bittaker responded by stabbing his pursuer in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. He attempted to flee but was quickly restrained by two other supermarket employees. The employee, Gary Louie, survived the stabbing, and Bittaker was convicted of the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon and sent to California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo.\n\nIn November 1969, Roy Norris was arrested for his first known sexual offenses: he was charged with both rape and assault with attempt to commit rape. In the latter incident, he had attempted to force his way into the car of a lone woman. Three months later, in February 1970, Norris attempted to deceive a lone woman into allowing him to enter her home. When the woman refused, he attempted to break into her house; the woman phoned the police, who arrested Norris before he had the opportunity to cause the woman any harm.\n\nLess than three months after this offense, Norris was diagnosed by military psychologists with a severe schizoid personality. He was given an administrative discharge from the Navy under terms labeled as psychological problems.\n\nIn May 1970, Norris—on bail for his latest offense—attacked a female student whom he had been stalking on the grounds of the San Diego State University campus. Norris repeatedly struck her on the back of the head with a rock until she slumped to her knees before he repeatedly beat her head against the sidewalk as he knelt upon her lower back. Shortly thereafter, Norris was charged with assault with a deadly weapon; he was committed to a total of five years' imprisonment at the Atascadero State Hospital, where he was classified as a mentally disordered sex offender.\n\nNorris was released from the Atascadero State Hospital in 1975, with five years' probation, having been declared by doctors as an individual who was of \"no further danger to others\". Just three months after his release, Norris approached a 27-year-old woman walking home from a restaurant in Redondo Beach and offered her a ride on his motorcycle. When she declined, Norris parked his motorcycle and grabbed the woman's scarf, twisting it around her neck, before informing her he intended to rape her and dragging her into nearby bushes. Fearing for her life, the woman did not resist the rape.\n\nAlthough the rape was reported to police, they were initially unable to find the perpetrator. However, one month later, the victim observed Norris' motorcycle and noted the license number, which she immediately gave to police. Norris was arrested for the rape; one year later, he was tried and convicted for this offense and sent to the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. While incarcerated at the California Men's Colony, Norris met and befriended Lawrence Bittaker.\n\nBittaker and Norris initially became loosely acquainted in 1977, one year after Norris arrived at San Luis Obispo. Bittaker's initial impression of Norris upon his arrival at the California Men's Colony was that he was a savvy individual, who largely associated with hardened criminals from motorcycle gangs, in addition to dealing in contraband drugs. The pair gradually became more closely acquainted, and only began talking in friendly terms when Norris taught Bittaker how to construct jewelry.\n\nAccording to Norris, Bittaker saved him from being attacked by fellow inmates on at least two occasions. By 1978, the pair had become close acquaintances; discovering they shared a common interest in sexual violence and misogyny, with Norris also divulging to Bittaker the biggest stimulation for him was of seeing frightened young women, adding this was the primary reason he had amassed a lengthy record for sexual offenses. Bittaker—who is not known to have committed any sexual offenses prior to his meeting Norris—himself divulged to Norris that if he ever raped a woman, he would kill her so as not to leave a witness to the crime.\n\nWhen alone, the pair regularly discussed plans to assault and murder teenage girls once they were freed. This shared fantasy evolved into an elaborate plan to murder one girl of each teenage year from 13 through 19. The pair vowed to become reacquainted once they were released.\n\nBittaker was released from the California Men's Colony on October 15, 1978; he returned to Los Angeles and found work as a skilled machinist. This work earned Bittaker close to $1,000 a week, and despite classifying himself as a loner, he became friendly with several people in his neighborhood, earning a reputation as a generous and helpful individual who occasionally donated money to The Salvation Army. On one occasion, he is known to have purchased large quantities of fast food and wine which he then handed to homeless individuals in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nBittaker was particularly popular amongst the local teenagers, and later admitted the primary reason he always had beer and marijuana in his Burbank motel was that his residence would remain a popular place for teenagers to socialize.\n\nThree months after Bittaker was released from the California Men's Colony, on January 15, 1979, Norris was released from prison and moved into his mother's home in Redondo Beach. He soon found employment as an electrician in Compton. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter from Bittaker. In late February, the pair met at a hotel and rekindled their plan to kidnap and rape girls.\n\nIn order for the pair to be able to successfully abduct teenage girls, Bittaker decided they would need a van as opposed to a car. With financial assistance from Norris, Bittaker purchased a silver 1977 GMC cargo van in February 1979. The vehicle was windowless on the sides and had a large passenger-side sliding door. According to Bittaker, when viewing this sliding door, he realized he or Norris could \"pull up [to a teenage girl] real close and not have to open the doors all the way.\" Bittaker and Norris would nickname this van \"Murder Mac\".\n\nFrom February to June 1979, Bittaker and Norris picked up over 20 female hitchhikers. The pair did not assault these girls in any manner: these practice runs were merely a way for them to develop ruses to lure girls into the van voluntarily and of discovering secluded locations. In late April, the pair discovered a secluded fire road located in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker broke the locked gate to this fire road with a crowbar and replaced the lock with one he owned.\n\nBittaker and Norris killed their first victim, 16-year-old Lucinda Lynn Schaefer, on June 24, 1979. Schaefer was last seen leaving a Presbyterian Church meeting in Redondo Beach. In his written accounts of the events of this day, Bittaker stated he and Norris first finished constructing the bed the pair had installed in the rear of the van, beneath which they placed tools, clothes and a cooler filled with beer and soft drinks. At approximately 11 a.m., the pair drove to \"the beach area, drinking beer, smoking grass and flirting with girls. We had no set routine.\"\n\nAt approximately 7:46 p.m., Norris spotted Schaefer walking down a side street and remarked to Bittaker, \"There's a cute little blonde.\"\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to entice Schaefer into their van with alternative offers of marijuana and a lift home, Bittaker and Norris drove further ahead and parked alongside a driveway. Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris exchanged a few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's arms and legs and gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.\n\nDespite initially screaming when she was abducted, Lucinda Schaefer quickly regained her composure. In his written account of the night that followed, Bittaker wrote that Lucinda Schaefer \"displayed a magnificent state of self-control and composed acceptance of the conditions of which she had no control. She shed no tears, offered no resistance and expressed no great concern for her safety ... I guess she knew what was coming.\"\n\nAt the fire road, Norris first raped Schaefer after instructing Bittaker to \"go take a walk\" and return in one hour. Upon returning to the van, Bittaker similarly raped the girl in Norris' absence. Upon the second occasion in which she was raped by Norris in Bittaker's absence, Schaefer asked him whether they intended to kill her, to which Norris replied, \"No.\" In response, Schaefer requested to be allowed time to pray before she was killed if that was Bittaker and Norris' intention.\n\nIn their subsequent accounts of the actual murder, Bittaker and Norris have given differing accounts as to who argued over whether they should kill her rather than release her: each stated the other argued that they should kill her. In any event, Schaefer pleaded for \"only a second, to pray,\" before Norris attempted to manually strangle her. After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at \"the look in her eyes\" and ran to the front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began convulsing. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with vise-grip pliers until Schaefer's convulsions ceased. Lucinda Schaefer was denied her requests to pray before Bittaker and Norris killed her.\n\nLucinda Schaefer's body was wrapped in a plastic shower curtain and thrown over a steep canyon Bittaker had selected. According to Norris, after Bittaker had thrown Schaefer over the canyon, Bittaker assured him \"the animals would eat her up, so there wouldn't be any evidence left.\"\n\nOn July 8, 1979, two weeks after the murder of Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker and Norris encountered 18-year-old Andrea Joy Hall hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway. As the pair slowed the van to offer Hall a lift, another vehicle pulled over and offered Hall exactly that, which she accepted. Bittaker and Norris followed the vehicle from a distance until Hall exited the vehicle in Redondo Beach.\nOn this occasion, Norris hid in the back of the van in order to dupe Hall into thinking Bittaker was alone. Inside the van, Bittaker offered Hall a soft drink from the cooler located in the rear of the van. Norris pounced on her when she went to retrieve it and, after a strenuous fight, managed to subdue Hall by twisting her arm behind her back, causing her to scream in pain. Norris then gagged Hall with adhesive tape and bound her wrists and ankles.\n\nBittaker and Norris drove Hall to a location in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. While Bittaker was raping Hall for the second time, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Bittaker clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle thought he had seen. When he returned, the pair drove to a location farther in the San Gabriel Mountains. Bittaker forced Hall to walk uphill naked alongside the road and to then perform oral sex on him, before ordering Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures.\n\nBittaker and Norris drove Hall to a third location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to purchase alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken, both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of \"sheer terror\" as she begged for her life to be spared. Bittaker informed Norris that he had told Hall he was going to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could come up with as to why she should be allowed to live, before thrusting an ice pick through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the ice pick into her other ear, stomping on it until the handle broke. Bittaker then strangled before throwing her body off a cliff.\n\nOn September 3, Bittaker and Norris observed two girls named Jackie Doris Gilliam and Jacqueline Leah Lamp sitting on a bus stop bench located close to Hermosa Beach. Lamp and Gilliam had been hitchhiking along the Pacific Coast Highway before Bittaker and Norris observed them as they were resting at the bus stop. Bittaker and Norris offered the girls a ride, which Gilliam and Lamp accepted. Inside the van, both girls were offered marijuana by Norris, which they accepted.\n\nShortly after entering the van, both girls realized that Bittaker had steered the van off the Pacific Coast Highway and was driving in the direction of the San Gabriel Mountains. When the girls protested, both Bittaker and Norris attempted to allay the girls' concerns with excuses, which did not deceive either girl. Lamp, aged 13, attempted to open the sliding door, whereupon Norris hit her on the back of the head with a bag filled with lead weights, briefly knocking her unconscious, before overpowering 15-year-old Jackie Gilliam. As he began to bind and gag Gilliam, Jacqueline Lamp regained consciousness and again attempted to flee the van, whereupon Norris twisted her arm behind her back and dragged her back into the van. As this struggle ensued, Bittaker—noting the girls' struggle was in full view of potential witnesses—stopped the van, punched Gilliam in the face, and assisted Norris in finishing binding and gagging the two girls.\n\nGilliam and Lamp were driven to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between repeated instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In the first of three instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed he buried the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple.\n\nAfter almost two days of captivity, Lamp and Gilliam were murdered. At Bittaker's subsequent trial, Norris claimed he had suggested that Gilliam be killed quickly as, unlike Lamp, she had been largely cooperative throughout the period of her captivity, whereupon Bittaker replied, \"No, they only die once anyway.\" Gilliam was struck in each ear with an ice pick, then strangled to death.\n\nAfter Bittaker had murdered Jackie Gilliam, he then forced Jacqueline Leah Lamp out of the van. Upon exiting the sliding door, Bittaker shouted to her: \"You wanted to stay a virgin; now you can die a virgin!\" before Norris struck her upon the head with a sledgehammer. Bittaker then strangled Lamp until he believed she had died; when Lamp opened her eyes, Norris again bludgeoned her repeatedly as Bittaker strangled her to death.\n\nThe bodies of Jackie Gilliam and Jacqueline Lamp were thrown over an embankment into the chaparral.\n\nBittaker and Norris abducted their final victim, 16-year-old Shirley Lynette Ledford, on October 31, 1979. Ledford was abducted as she stood outside a gas station; hitchhiking home from a Halloween party in the Sunland-Tujunga suburb of Los Angeles. Investigators believe Ledford accepted a ride home from Bittaker and Norris because she recognized Bittaker, as he is known to have frequented the restaurant in which Ledford held a part-time job as a waitress.\n\nUpon accepting the offer of a lift home and entering the van, Ledford was offered marijuana by Norris, which she refused. Bittaker drove the van to a secluded street, where Norris drew a knife, then bound and gagged Ledford with construction tape.\n\nBittaker then traded places with Norris, who drove in an aimless manner for in excess of an hour as Bittaker remained with Ledford in the back of the van. After removing the construction tape from the girl's mouth and legs, Bittaker tormented Ledford: initially slapping and mocking her, then beating her with his fists as he repeatedly shouted for her to \"say something\", then, as Shirley Ledford began screaming, shouting for her to \"scream louder\". As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: \"What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?\"\n\nAs Shirley Ledford began to cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, \"No, don't touch me.\" In response, Bittaker again ordered her to scream as loud as she wished, then began alternately striking her with a hammer, beating her breasts with his fists and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, \"Oh no! No!\" as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering the rear of the van. Norris later described hearing \"screams ... constant screams\" emanating from the rear of the van as he drove.\n\nShortly after Norris switched places with Bittaker, he himself switched on the tape recorder which Bittaker had used to record much of the time he had been in the rear of the van with Ledford. Norris first shouted for Ledford to: \"Go ahead and scream or I'll make you scream.\" In response, Ledford pleaded, \"I'll scream if you stop hitting me,\" then emitted several high-pitched screams as Norris encouraged her to continue until he ordered her to stop.\n\nNorris then reached for the sledgehammer as Shirley Ledford—seeing him do this—screamed, \"Oh no!\" Norris then struck Ledford once upon the left elbow. In response, she informed Norris he had broken her elbow, before pleading, \"Don't hit me again.\" In response, Norris again raised the sledgehammer as Ledford repeatedly screamed, \"No!\" Norris then proceeded to strike Ledford 25 consecutive times upon the same elbow with the sledgehammer, before asking her, \"What are you sniveling about?\" as Ledford continuously screamed and wept.\nAfter approximately two hours of captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died with her eyes open. Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn.\n\nShirley Lynette Ledford's body was found by a jogger the following morning. An autopsy revealed that, in addition to having been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her olecranon sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body. In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed.\n\nBittaker would later claim the tape recording the pair had created of Shirley Ledford's clear abuse and torture offered nothing other than the evidence of a threesome, adding that, towards the very end, Shirley Ledford was screaming for he and Norris to kill her.\n\nIn November 1979, Roy Norris became reacquainted with a friend named Jimmy Dalton, an individual with whom he had previously been incarcerated at the California Men's Colony. Norris confided in this individual as to his and Bittaker's exploits over the previous five months, including graphic details of the murder of Shirley Ledford (the only victim whose body had been found at this time). Norris also divulged to Dalton that, in addition to the five murders he and Bittaker had committed, there had been three additional incidents in which he and Bittaker had abducted or attempted to abduct young women who had either successfully escaped their attackers or, in one instance, had actually been raped but released.\n\nUpon hearing Norris's confessions, Dalton consulted his attorney, who advised him to inform authorities. Dalton agreed, and he and his attorney informed the Los Angeles Police Department, who in turn relayed the two men to the Redondo Beach police.\n\nA Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was assigned to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October. Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been reported missing over the previous five months. In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed mace in the face of a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her face before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released. Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.\n\nBynum dispatched an investigator to visit Robin Robeck at her residence in Oregon, to show her a series of mug shots. Without hesitation, Robeck positively identified two photos presented to her as those of the men who had kidnapped and raped her on September 30. The two individuals she identified were Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris.\n\nUpon linking Bittaker and Norris to the rape of Robin Robeck, the Hermosa Beach police placed Roy Norris under surveillance; within days, they had observed his dealing in marijuana. On November 20, 1979, Norris was arrested by the Hermosa Beach police for parole violation. The same day, at the Burbank motel where he resided, Bittaker was arrested for the rape of Robin Robeck.\n\nAlthough Robeck had been able to identify mug shots of Bittaker and Norris, in a police lineup she was unable to positively identify her assailants. Nonetheless, police had observed Norris dealing in marijuana, whereas Bittaker had been in possession of drugs at the time of his arrest. Both were held on charges of parole violation.\n\nA search of Bittaker's apartment revealed several Polaroid photographs which were determined as depicting Andrea Joy Hall and Jackie Gilliam—both of whom had been reported as missing earlier the same year. Inside Bittaker's van, investigators discovered a sledgehammer, a plastic bag filled with lead weights, a book detailing how to locate police radio frequencies, a jar of Vaseline, two necklaces (later confirmed as belonging to two of the victims) and a tape recording of a young woman in obvious distress; screaming and pleading for mercy while in the process of torture and sexual abuse. The mother of Shirley Lynette Ledford—named by Jimmy Dalton as being one of the women whom Norris had confessed he and Bittaker had killed—identified the voice on the tape as being that of her only daughter; the voices of the two men mocking and threatening Shirley Ledford in the process of her torture and abuse were identified as being Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker. Also found in Bittaker's motel were seven bottles of various acidic materials. (Investigators would later discover Bittaker planned to use these acidic materials upon their next victim.)\n\nInside Norris's apartment, police discovered a bracelet he had taken from Shirley Ledford's body as a souvenir. Also found at the homes of both Bittaker and Norris were Polaroid pictures of almost 500 teenage girls and young women, most of which had apparently been taken at Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, with others taken by Bittaker at a Burbank high school. Most of these pictures had been taken without the girls' knowledge or consent.\n\nOn November 30, 1979, Norris attended a preliminary hearing in relation to the September 30 rape. By this stage, Norris was beginning to display visible signs of stress. At the hearing, Norris waived his Miranda rights, before Detective Bynum and Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay began questioning him, initially in relation to the rape of Robin Robeck; then in relation to the statements given to police by Jimmy Dalton and the evidence recovered from his and Bittaker's residences.\n\nInitially, Norris flatly denied any involvement in any murders, rapes or disappearances; however, when confronted with the evidence investigators had compiled, Norris began to confess, although he did attempt to portray Bittaker as being more culpable in the murders than himself. In what Bynum and Kay later described as a \"casual, unconcerned manner,\" Norris divulged that he and Bittaker had been in the habit of driving around areas such as the Pacific Coast Highway and randomly approaching girls whom they found attractive with offers of a ride, posing with the pair for photographs, or marijuana. Most of those whom they approached rejected whatever given ruse Bittaker and Norris used to entice them into the van; although four girls had accepted lifts from the pair and had been murdered, with a fifth victim—their first—being grabbed by force.\n\nInside the van, the girls would typically be overpowered, bound hand and foot, gagged, and driven to locations deep within the San Gabriel Mountains, where they would be sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation with a wire coat hanger, although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.\n\nAccording to Norris, the level of brutality Bittaker had exhibited towards their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van: their final victim, Shirley Ledford, had actually pleaded to be killed in order that her agony could cease. Additional details provided by Norris provided further corroborating evidence to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Lucinda Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted and that Schaefer had lost one shoe as she had been dragged into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979.\n\nIn a press statement relating to the police investigation into the murders issued on February 7, 1980, Los Angeles County Sheriff Peter Pitchess stated the victims had been subjected to \"sadistic and barbaric abuse,\" adding that five charges of first-degree murder would be sought against both Bittaker and Norris. Sheriff Pitchess also stated that, in relation to the Polaroid pictures found in Bittaker and Norris's apartments, police had located 60 of the young women depicted—none of whom had been harmed.\n\nNonetheless, Pitchess also stated that police had also identified 19 of the women depicted in the pictures as being individuals who had been reported missing, and that these teenage girls and young women may well have been murdered, although Pitchess did stress that they had no conclusive evidence to suggest that these additional 19 women photographed had fallen victim to Bittaker and Norris.\n\nOne of the individuals depicted in the Polaroid pictures seized from Bittaker and Norris depicts an unidentified young white woman, alone with Bittaker and Norris, in circumstances very similar to the pictures found depicting known victims Andrea Hall, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, and Jackie Gilliam. The young woman in the pictures has never been identified. This photograph is indicative there may have been one further victim whom neither Bittaker or Norris have ever mentioned to investigators.\n\nNorris agreed to return to the San Gabriel Mountains to search for the bodies of the girls to whose abduction and murder he had confessed to assisting in. In each instance, Norris brought detectives to the area where he and Bittaker had disposed of their victims' bodies. Despite extensive searches of the areas where he stated the bodies of Lucinda Schaefer and Andrea Hall had been discarded, their bodies were never found. Nonetheless, on February 9, 1980, the skeletalized bodies of Jacqueline Leah Lamp and Jackie Doris Gilliam were found at the bottom of a canyon, alongside a dry river bed. The bodies were scattered over an area measuring hundreds of feet in diameter. An ice pick was still lodged in the skull of Jackie Gilliam; the skull of Jacqueline Leah Lamp bore multiple indentations—evidence of the numerous hammer blows Norris had stated he inflicted.\nIn February 1980, Norris and Bittaker were formally charged with the murders of the five girls. At the arraignment, Bittaker was denied bail, whereas Norris's bail was set at $10,000. Within one month of his being charged with murder, Norris had accepted a plea bargain in which he would testify against Bittaker in return for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty against him.\n\nOn March 18, 1980, Roy Norris pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder; one count of second-degree murder (in relation to victim Andrea Joy Hall), two counts of rape, and one count of robbery. Formal sentencing was postponed until May 7.\n\nIn return for Norris's agreeing to plead guilty and to testify against Lawrence Bittaker, prosecutors had agreed to seek neither the death penalty nor life without parole at the upcoming sentencing hearing.\n\nPrior to his May 7 sentencing, Norris was reviewed by a probation officer who testified at his sentencing that Norris had again accused Bittaker of the actual torture of their victims, and that for Norris himself, the feeling of power and the dominance he had over the victims was the main overriding factor, as opposed to having sexual intercourse with them. The parole officer added that Norris \"never exhibited any remorse or compassion about his brutal acts towards the victims ... the defendant appears compulsive in his need to desire to inflict pain and torture upon women.\" In conclusion, the probation officer testified that Norris \"can realistically be regarded as an extreme sociopath, whose depraved pattern of behavior is beyond rehabilitation.\"\n\nOn May 7, 1980, Roy Norris was sentenced to 45 years to life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole from 2010.\n\nOn April 24, 1980, Lawrence Bittaker was arraigned on a total of 29 charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy, and murder in addition to various charges of criminal conspiracy and possession of a firearm. He was also charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit murder dating from December 1979 in which he had unsuccessfully attempted to persuade two inmates due to be released to murder Robin Robeck in order to prevent her from testifying against him at his upcoming trial. The charges for the rape of Robin Robeck would later be dropped because of a lack of physical evidence as well as Robeck's failing to identify her attackers in a lineup.\n\nWhen asked by Judge William Hollingsworth as to how he pleaded, Bittaker remained silent—refusing to answer any questions. In response, the judge entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.\n\nThe trial of Lawrence Bittaker began on January 19, 1981. He was tried in Torrance before Judge Thomas Fredericks.\n\nThe star witness to appear for the prosecution at the trial of Lawrence Bittaker was Roy Norris, who began his testimony on January 22. Norris testified as to how he became acquainted with Bittaker in jail, and how the pair had formulated a plan to kidnap, rape and kill teenage girls. Responding to questions from the prosecutor, Norris stated that in June 1979, he had unsuccessfully attempted to abduct and rape a woman, who escaped unharmed. When he informed Bittaker of this incident, they both agreed to act together on all future abductions.\n\nNorris then chronologically recounted for the court the details of each of the five murders he and Bittaker had committed in addition to the September 30, 1979 rape of Robin Robeck, the attempted abduction of a woman named Jan Malin, which had also occurred on September 30, and the attempted abduction of an unidentified young woman on September 27.\n\nIn reference to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location at or near the San Dimas Canyon. In reference to the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for \"over a day\" before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that \"I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed.\" Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified as to Bittaker having shown them pictures of the victims he had retained as keepsakes and which had been found in his motel. One witness, a 17-year-old neighbor of Bittaker's named Christina Dralle, testified that Bittaker had shown her a Polaroid picture he had taken of Jackie Gilliam before stating, \"The girls I get won't talk anymore.\" Another witness to testify was an individual named Lloyd Douglas, who had shared a jail cell with Bittaker following his November 1979 arrest. Douglas testified that Bittaker had discussed in detail the torture he had inflicted on victims Jackie Gilliam and Shirley Ledford, stating Bittaker had informed him he had stabbed one of Gilliam's breasts with an ice pick, which he then twisted as the tool remained inserted in the wound; he had also \"pinched\" Gilliam on the legs and breasts with a vise grip, before tearing off part of one nipple. Douglas also stated Bittaker had informed him he had \"pulled on\" the genitals and breasts of Shirley Ledford with the same instrument, and that he had attempted to beat her breasts \"back into her chest.\"\n\nThe defense contended that Norris was the actual perpetrator of the murders and that Bittaker had only become aware of Norris's activities shortly before his arrest when Norris had informed him he had murdered several girls with whom they had both encountered and engaged in sexual activities. To support their case, the defense produced a friend of Norris named Richard Shoopman, who testified as to Norris's repeatedly divulging to him his desire to rape young girls. Shoopman also testified that Norris had informed him that the look of shock and fear on the face of a young girl was a prime sexual stimulus for him. In support of Bittaker's case, the defense also harked to the Polaroid images taken of the facial expressions of Andrea Hall, and of Bittaker's statements as to Norris's revelations to Bittaker regarding his prime sexual stimulations while both were incarcerated at the California Men's Colony in 1977.\nThe most damning evidence presented at Bittaker's trial was a 17-minute section of the audio tape the pair had created of Shirley Lynette Ledford's abuse and torment. The audiotape, which had been found inside Bittaker's van and which Norris had earlier testified Bittaker had repeatedly played as he drove in the weeks prior to his arrest—adding that Bittaker considered the contents to be \"real funny\"—was presented in evidence on January 29, with Stephen Kay forewarning the jury: \"For those of you who do not know what hell is like, you will find out.\" (Judge Fredericks had earlier denied motions by the defense to omit the tape recording from admission as evidence.)\n\nMore than 100 people were present in the courtroom as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, dabbing tears from their eyes or rushing out of the courtroom before the tape had finished. Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape—smiling throughout the hearing of the recording.\n\nIn one of two instances throughout the trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears, he walked out of the courtroom during recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse, and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: \"Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls ... how alone they were when they died.\" When questioned by reporters as to whether the audiotape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: \"You're darn right it [the audio tape] should have been. The jury needs to know what these guys did.\"\n\nOn February 5, 1981, Bittaker testified on his own behalf. Bittaker denied any knowledge in the abduction and murder of Lucinda Schaefer, and claimed he had paid Andrea Hall to pose for the Polaroid photographs depicting her found at his Burbank motel after Hall had agreed to his offer of $200 for sex. He then claimed Norris had walked Hall into the San Gabriel Mountains, before returning alone and informing Bittaker he had told Hall to \"find her own way home.\"\n\nBittaker had a similar explanation as to the double murder of Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam: he claimed Gilliam accepted an offer of money for sex and posing for pictures, and that he had last seen the girls alone with Norris in his GMC van. With regards to the murder of Shirley Ledford, he claimed she had agreed to theatrically scream for the tape recorder, and that she was not tortured in his presence, but had been left alone with Norris.\n\nBittaker's trial lasted for over three weeks. On February 10, 1981, the prosecution and defense counsels began their closing arguments. In the closing argument delivered by the prosecution, Stephen Kay apologized to the jury that he was only asking for the death penalty, adding that he wished the law permitted him to request that the same suffering be inflicted upon Bittaker that he had inflicted upon his victims. Kay then described Bittaker as an \"excuse for a man\" as he held aloft pictures of each of the five murdered girls before the jury. Seeking the death penalty for Bittaker, Kay referred to the case as \"one of the most shocking, brutal cases in the history of American crime,\" before adding: \"If the death penalty is not appropriate in this case, then when will it ever be?\"\n\nDefense attorney Albert Garber requested the jury discount the testimony of Roy Norris; arguing in favor of Bittaker's claims that Norris had committed the actual murders, and claiming the testimony of the prosecutors throughout the trial amounted to little more than a \"bloodlust,\" adding that the prosecution had repeatedly recited the \"gory details\" of the murders. Garber harked to the earlier testimony of a psychologist named Michael Maloney, who had testified as to Bittaker's inability to empathize with other people's feelings and emotions in addition to the fact that, with the exception of Bittaker's 1974 stabbing of Gary Louie, all of Bittaker's previous criminal convictions were for nonviolent offenses. The defense also claimed that insufficient corroborative evidence existed to convict Bittaker.\n\nOn February 17, 1981, after deliberating for three days, the jury found Bittaker guilty of five counts of first-degree murder, one charge of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, five charges of kidnapping, nine charges of rape, two charges of forcible oral copulation, one charge of sodomy, and three charges of unlawful possession of a firearm. Deliberations as to whether Bittaker should be sentenced to death or life without parole began February 19.\n\nThe jury deliberated for just 90 minutes before they returned with their verdict: Bittaker was sentenced to death for the five counts of first-degree murder upon which the prosecution had sought this penalty. He showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered. Superior Court Judge Thomas Fredericks then ordered Bittaker to appear in court on March 24 for formal sentencing.\n\nOn March 24, in accordance with the jury verdict, Lawrence Bittaker was formally sentenced to death. In the event that the sentence imposed was ever reverted to life imprisonment, Judge Thomas Fredericks imposed an alternative sentence of 199 years, 4 months' imprisonment to take immediate effect.\n\nBittaker appealed his conviction and sentencing, citing procedural errors such as the validity of warrants used to authorize the search of his van and motel room, and the dismissal by the judge of a woman initially hired at the stage of jury selection to advise the defense counsel in matters relating to jury views upon the death penalty. Nonetheless, Bittaker's appeal was dismissed on June 22, 1989, with the court ruling that any procedural errors were minor and—in view of the strong evidence against Bittaker—did not affect the overall verdict.\n\nAn initial execution date for Lawrence Bittaker was set for December 29, 1989. Bittaker appealed this decision, although on June 11, 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision that he be executed. A renewed execution date was scheduled for July 23, 1991. Bittaker again appealed the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that he be executed, and was granted a further stay of execution on July 9, 1991.\n\n, Lawrence Bittaker remains incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison.\n\nLawrence Bittaker has granted several death row interviews following his 1981 conviction. To date, he has never expressed any remorse for his crimes, and states the only remorse he feels is for the fact he and Norris were arrested, thus \"ruining\" his own life. Despite the fact Bittaker currently considers his life to have been a \"wasted\" one, he has also marveled that he and Norris had little in common before their acquaintance at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo in 1977, before adding that they have \"one hell of a lot in common now!\" In reference to one of the torture- and murder implements he and Norris used upon their victims, Bittaker responds to letters he receives with the nickname \"Pliers\" Bittaker.\n\nSince his incarceration, Bittaker has filed more than 40 frivolous lawsuits over issues as trivial as his being served a broken cookie and crushed sandwiches by the prison cafeteria, which he cited as an example of his being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Bittaker was declared a vexatious litigant in 1993. As a result of this declaration, he may no longer file lawsuits without the express permission of an attorney or a judge.\n\nRoy Norris remains incarcerated at Donovan State Prison. Since his conviction, he has repeatedly claimed the sole reason he participated in the murders was out of fear of Bittaker. Norris also claims to have twice contemplated confessing to his and Bittaker's responsibility in the murders to the police; he also claims to have successfully deterred three potential victims from entering Bittaker's van.\n\nNorris claims that although he enjoyed the actual intercourse with the victims, only Bittaker enjoyed the act of torture and murder, stating: \"I didn't enjoy killing—that was Lawrence [Bittaker]. It was his favorite part: watching the women struggle to live; knowing he'd soon be taking life away.\" (Both investigators and psychologists have stated Norris derived extreme gratification from the domination, abuse, and torture inflicted upon his victims; these respective parties have also harked towards Norris's extensive history of physical and sexual violence against women prior to his meeting Bittaker, and his repeated instances of denial of culpability for his actions.)\n\nRoy Norris initially became eligible for parole in 2009. Norris declined to attend the parole hearing, thereby automatically deferring his parole eligibility for another 10 years. He is next eligible for parole in 2019.\n\nStephen Kay, the prosecutor at Bittaker's trial, still considers the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as being the worst criminal case he has ever prosecuted or encountered and remains insistent in his belief that Bittaker deserves to be executed more than any other inmate incarcerated on California's death row. In interviews, he has stated that for over two years following the trial of Lawrence Bittaker, his sleep was disturbed by recurring nightmares in which he would be rushing to Bittaker's van to prevent harm coming to the girls, but would \"always get there too late.\"\n\nDetective Paul Bynum, the chief investigator of the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris, committed suicide in December 1987. He was 39 years old. In a ten-page suicide note, Bynum specifically referred to the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as haunting him, and of his fear they may be released from prison.\n\nThe audio tape Bittaker and Norris created of themselves raping and torturing Shirley Lynette Ledford remains in the possession of the FBI Academy. The audio cassette is now used to train and desensitize FBI agents to the raw reality of torture and murder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "574823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=574823", "title": "Legitimacy (political)", "text": "Legitimacy (political)\n\nIn political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a régime. Whereas \"authority\" denotes a specific position in an established government, the term \"legitimacy\" denotes a \"system\" of government—wherein \n\"government\" denotes \"sphere of influence\". An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise power. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular régimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential élite. In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the Mandate of Heaven, and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.\n\nIn moral philosophy, the term \"legitimacy\" is often positively interpreted as the normative status conferred by a governed people upon their governors' institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government's actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.\n\nThe Enlightenment-era British social philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit consent of the governed: \"The argument of the [\"Second\"] \"Treatise\" is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed.\" The German political philosopher Dolf Sternberger said that \"[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government's part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right\". The American political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset said that legitimacy also \"involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society\". The American political scientist Robert A. Dahl explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.\n\nLegitimacy is \"a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper\". In political science, legitimacy usually is understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing régime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German sociologist Max Weber are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:\n\n\nIn a theocracy, government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.\n\n\n\nThe political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions—legislative, judicial, executive—combined for the national common good. One way civil society grants legitimacy to governments is through public elections. There are also those who refute the legitimacy offered by public elections, pointing out that the amount of legitimacy public elections can grant depends significantly on the electoral system conducting the elections. In the United States this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by gerrymandering and the repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote. \n\nCivil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability than voting, such as financial transparency and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms. \n\nIn an effort determine what makes a government legitimate the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate. The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered \"good governance\" that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).\n\nAssessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. Fritz Scharpf introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by Vivien Schmidt, who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.\n\nAbulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering \"what\" is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering \"who\" is the 'legitimator'). NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad, PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL (\"the people\" as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.\n\nWeber's understanding of legitimacy rests on shared \"values\", such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or 'output' of a state often only respond to shared \"needs\". Therefore, substantive sources of legitimacy need to be distinguished from more instrumental ones. \"Instrumental legitimacy\" rests on \"the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, \"substantive legitimacy\" is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages.\"\n\nMax Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That democracy was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of popular suffrage. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational–legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the Nazi Germany of Adolf Hitler, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, and Francoist Spain under General Francisco Franco.\nThe French political scientist Mattei Dogan's contemporary interpretation of Weber's types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the twenty-first century. Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government (e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the Ayatollah Khomeini). That traditional authority has disappeared in the Middle East; that the rule-proving exceptions are Islamic Iran and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.\n\nIn determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper—\"political legitimacy\"—is philosophically an essentially contested concept that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, qualitative, and evaluative concepts such as \"art\", \"social justice\", et cetera, as applied in aesthetics, political philosophy, the philosophy of history, and the philosophy of religion. Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term \"essentially contested concept\" indicates that a key term (communism, democracy, constitutionalism, etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of dogmatism (\"My answer is right, and all others are wrong\"), scepticism (\"All answers are equally true or [false]; everyone has a right to his own truth\"), and eclecticism (\"Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better\") are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning. (see: Walter Bryce Gallie)\n\nEstablishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:\n"}
{"id": "1068230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1068230", "title": "Market power", "text": "Market power\n\nIn economics and particularly in industrial organization, market power is the ability of a firm to profitably raise the market price of a good or service over marginal cost. In perfectly competitive markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Market participants that have market power are therefore sometimes referred to as \"price makers\" or \"price setters\", while those without are sometimes called \"price takers\". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and long run average cost, so the firm makes profit.\n\nA firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have anti-trust or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.\n\nA firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—monopoly and monopsony—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly concentrated markets may be contestable if there are no barriers to entry or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels.\n\nMarket power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral anti-competitive behavior. Some of the behaviours that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include predatory pricing, product tying, and creation of overcapacity or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through collusion, or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power.\n\nThe Lerner index and Herfindahl index may be used to measure market power.\n\nWhen several firms control a significant share of market sales, the resulting market structure is called an oligopoly or oligopsony. An oligopoly may engage in collusion, either tacit or overt, and thereby exercise market power. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a cartel.\n\nMonopoly power is an example of market failure which occurs when one or more of the participants has the ability to influence the price or other outcomes in some general or specialized market. The most commonly discussed form of market power is that of a monopoly, but other forms such as monopsony, and more moderate versions of these two extremes, exist.\n\nA well-known example of monopolistic market power is Microsoft's market share in PC operating systems. The \"United States v. Microsoft\" case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its web browser with its operating system. \nIn this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.\n\nA monopoly can raise prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer has no other place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without. Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry. OPEC is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources — oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs. Firms in such industries become more profitable with size. Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for start up firms to succeed. Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large start up costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue. Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes. Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.\n\nConcentration ratios are the most common measures of market power. The four-firm concentration ratio measures the percentage of total industry output attributable to the top four companies. For monopolies the four firm ratio is 100 per cent while the ratio is zero for perfect competition. The four firm concentration domestic (U.S) ratios for cigarettes is 93%; for automobiles, 84% and for beer, 85%.\n\nAnother measure of concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) which is calculated by \"summing the squares of the percentage market shares of all participants in the market\". The HHI index for perfect competition is zero; for monopoly, 10,000.\n\nU.S. courts almost never consider a firm to possess market power if it has a market share of less than 50 percent.\n\nMarket power is the ability to raise price above marginal cost (MC) and earn a positive profit. The degree to which a firm can raise price (P) above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at the profit maximizing output. That is, elasticity is the critical factor in determining market power. The relationship between market power and the price elasticity of demand (PED) can be summarized by the equation:\n\nNote that PED will be negative, so the ratio is always greater than one. The higher the P/MC ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the P/MC ratio approaches one, and market power approaches zero.\nThe equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:\n\nJean Tirole was awarded the 2014 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of market power and economic regulation.\n\n\n"}

The term Mars cycler may also refer to a spacecraft on a Mars cycler trajectory. The Aldrin cycler is an example of a Mars cycler.\n\nCyclers are potentially useful for transporting people or materials between those bodies using minimal propellant (relying on gravity-assist flybys for most trajectory changes), and can carry heavy radiation shielding to protect people in transit from cosmic rays and solar storms.\n\nA cycler is a trajectory that encounters two or more bodies on a regular basis. Once the orbit is established, no propulsion is required to shuttle between the two bodies on a regular basis, although some minor corrections may be necessary due to small perturbations in the orbit. The use of cyclers was considered in 1969 by Walter M. Hollister, who examined the case of an Earth-Venus cycler. \n\nCycler trajectories between Earth and Mars occur in whole-number multiples of the synodic period between the two planets, which is about 2.135 Earth years. A Martian year is 1.8808 Earth years, so Mars makes eight orbits of the Sun in about the same time as Earth makes 15. In 1985, Buzz Aldrin presented an extension of his earlier Lunar cycler work which identified a Mars cycler corresponding to a single synodic period. The Aldrin cycler (as it is now known) makes a single eccentric loop around the Sun. It travels from Earth to Mars orbit in 146 days, spends the next 16 months beyond the orbit of Mars, and another 146 days from the Martian orbit back to Earth.\n\nThe existence of the now-eponymous Aldrin Cycler was calculated and confirmed by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory later that year, along with the VISIT-1 and VISIT-2 cyclers proposed by John Niehoff in 1985. For each Earth–Mars cycler that isn't a multiple of 7 synodic periods, an outbound cycler intersects Mars on the way out from Earth while an inbound cycler intersects Mars on the way in to Earth. The only difference in these trajectories is the date in the synodic period in which the vehicle is launched from Earth. Earth–Mars cyclers with a multiple of 7 synodic periods return to Earth at nearly the same point in its orbit and may encounter Earth and/or Mars multiple times during each cycle. VISIT 1 encounters Earth 3 times and Mars 4 times in 15 years. VISIT 2 encounters Earth 5 times and Mars 2 times in 15 years. Some possible Earth–Mars cyclers include the following:\nA detailed survey of Earth–Mars cycler trajectories was conducted by Russell and Ocampo. They identified 24 Earth-Mars cyclers with periods of two to four synodic periods, and 92 cyclers with periods of five or six synodic periods. They also found hundreds of non-ballistic cyclers, ones which would require some powered maneuvers.\n\nThe shape of the cycler can be obtained from the conic equation:\n\nEarth orbits the Sun in one Earth year, Mars in 1.0888. Neither orbit is perfectly circular; Earth has an orbital eccentricity of 0.0168, and Mars of 0.0934. The two orbits are not quite coplanar either, as the orbit of Mars in inclined by 1.85 degrees to that of Earth. The effect of the gravity of Mars on the cycler orbits is almost negligible, but that of the far more massive Earth needs to be considered. If we ignore these factors, and approximate Mars's orbital period as 1.875 Earth years, then 15 Earth years is 8 Martian years. In the diagram opposite, a spacecraft in an Aldrin cycler orbit that starts from Earth at point E1 will encounter Mars at M1. When it gets back to E1 just over two Earth years later, Earth will no longer be there, but it will encounter Earth again at E2, which is 51.4 degrees, of an Earth orbit, further round.\nWhere r is 1 astronomical unit, a is the semi-major axis, \"ε\" is the orbital eccentricity and \"θ\" is -25.7 (half of -50.4). We can obtain a by solving Lambert's problem with 50.4 as the initial and final transfer angle. This gives us:\nSolving the quadratic equation gives us:\nwith an orbital period of 2.02 years.\n\nThe angle at which the spacecraft flies past Earth, \"γ\", is given by:\nSubstituting the values given and derived above gives us a value for \"γ\" of 7.18 degrees. We can calculate the gravity assist from Earth:\nwhere V is the heliocentric flyby velocity. This can be calculated from:\nwhere is the velocity of Earth, which is 29.8 km/s. Substituting gives us V = 34.9 km/s, and V = 8.73 km/s.\n\nThe excess speed is given by:\nWhich gives us a value for of 6.54 km/s. The turn angle can be calculated from:\nWhich gives us = 41.9 degrees, meaning that we have an 83.8 degree turn. The radius of closest approach to Earth will be given by:\nWhere is the gravitational constant of the Earth. Substituting the values gives us = , which is bad because the radius of the Earth is . A correction would therefore be required to comfortably avoid the planet.\n\nAldrin proposed a pair of Mars cycler vehicles providing regular transport between Earth and Mars. While the astronauts traveling to the Moon could do so in a small spacecraft, a mission to Mars would require something much larger. Astronauts would need a much larger facility with life support, living space and radiation shielding for the much longer journey. A 1999 NASA study estimated that a mission to Mars would require lifting about into space, of which was propellant. At the going rate of around $20 million per ton, this would cost $8.4 billion.\n\nAldrin proposed that the costs of Mars missions could be greatly reduced by use of large space stations, called \"castles\", in cyclic orbits. Once established in their orbits, they would make regular trips between Earth and Mars without requiring any propellant. Items other than consumables would therefore have to be launched only once. Two castles would be used, an outbound one on an Aldrin cycler with a fast transfer to Mars and long trip back, and an inbound one with fast trip to Earth and long return to Mars, which Aldrin called up and down escalators.\n\nThe astronauts would meet up with the cycler in Earth orbit and later Mars orbit in specialised craft called \"taxis\". One cycler would travel an outbound route from Earth to Mars in about five months. Another Mars cycler in a complementary trajectory would travel from Mars to Earth, also in about five months. Taxi and cargo vehicles would attach to the cycler at one planet and detach upon reaching the other. The cycler concept would therefore provide for routine safe and economic transport between Earth and Mars.\n\nA significant drawback of the cycler concept was that the Aldrin cycler flies by both planets at high speed. A taxi would need to accelerate to around Earth, and near Mars. To get around this, Aldrin proposed what he called a \"semi-cycler\", in which the castle would slow down around Mars, orbiting it, and later resuming the cycler orbit. This would require fuel to execute the braking and re-cycling maneivers.\n\nThe problem of getting the castles into cycler orbits was also considered. It was found that this could be accomplished with considerable savings in fuel by performing a series of low thrust maneuvers. Upon launch, the castle would be placed into an interim orbit, and then use the Earth's mass to assist it into the cycler orbit. Assuming the use of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel, which has a specific impulse of about 450 s, in the vicinity of Earth, and monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide fuel, as was employed by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft for deep space maneuvers, which has a specific impulse of 300 s, it is possible to estimate the fuel required to establish a cycler obit. \n\nIn the case of the Aldrin cycler, use of a gravity assist reduces the fuel requirement by about , or 15 percent. Other cyclers showed less impressive improvement, due to the shape of their orbits, and when the they encounter the Earth. In the case of the VISIT-1 cycler, the benefit would be around , less than one percent, which would hardly justify the additional three years required to establish the orbit.\n\n"}

Some of these efforts are part of a greater Mars colonization vision, while others are for glory (being first), or scientific endeavours. Some of this competitiveness is part of the NewSpace race.\n\nThe race to Mars involves competition between manufacturers and nations. NASA has demurred in a potential rivalry with SpaceX or other manufacturers in any possible race to be first to Mars. It instead sees synergies in possible cooperation with such entities. However, politicians may push NASA into competition with private entities such as Boeing and SpaceX in getting humans to Mars. President Trump has planned for NASA to reach Mars in the 2030s.\n\nBoeing has stated that one of its rockets will lead to the first crewed expedition to Mars, before SpaceX or others will land a crewed mission. Boeing is the primary contractor on the U.S. Space Launch System (SLS) NASA rocket program that has the ultimate goal of a crewed Mars mission. SpaceX has declined to state that it is a race, or that it needs to race Boeing.\n\nBlue Origin has stated that with its New Armstrong and New Glenn rockets, it may be attempting missions to Mars, head-to-head with SpaceX's Interplanetary Transport System.

{"id": "976335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=976335", "title": "Mirror test", "text": "Mirror test\n\nThe mirror test – sometimes called the mark test, mirror self-recognition test (MSR), red spot technique, or rouge test – is a behavioural technique developed in 1970 by psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr. as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.\nThe MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure self-awareness. However, there has been agreement that animals can be self-aware in ways not measured by the mirror test, such as distinguishing between their own and others' songs and scents. On the other hand, animals can pass the MSR and not necessarily have self-awareness.\n\nIn the classic MSR test, an animal is anaesthetised and then marked (e.g. painted, or a sticker attached) on an area of the body the animal cannot normally see. When the animal recovers from the anesthetic, it is given access to a mirror. If the animal then touches or investigates the mark, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as itself, rather than of another animal.\n\nVery few species have passed the MSR test. As of 2016, only great apes (including humans), a single Asiatic elephant, dolphins, orcas, and the Eurasian magpie have passed the MSR test. A wide range of species have been reported to fail the test, including several species of monkey, giant pandas, sea lions, and dogs.\n\nThe inspiration for the mirror test comes from an anecdote about Charles Darwin and a captive orangutan. While visiting the London Zoo in 1838, Darwin observed an orangutan, named Jenny, throwing a tantrum after being teased with an apple by her keeper. This started him thinking about the subjective experience of an orangutan. He also watched Jenny gaze into a mirror and noted the possibility that she recognised herself in the reflection.\n\nIn 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., experimentally investigated the possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild pre-adolescent chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes\"), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously. Each chimpanzee was put into a room by itself for two days. Next, a full-length mirror was placed in the room for a total of 80 hours at periodically decreasing distances. A multitude of behaviours was recorded upon introducing the mirrors to the chimpanzees. Initially, the chimpanzees made threatening gestures at their own images, ostensibly seeing their own reflections as threatening. Eventually, the chimps used their own reflections for self-directed responding behaviours, such as grooming parts of their body previously not observed without a mirror, picking their noses, making faces, and blowing bubbles at their own reflections.\n\nGallup expanded the study by manipulating the chimpanzees' appearance and observing their reaction to their reflection in the mirror. Gallup anaesthetised the chimpanzees and then painted a red alcohol-soluble dye on the eyebrow ridge and on the top half of the opposite ear. When the dye dried, it had virtually no olfactory or tactile cues. Gallup then returned the chimpanzees to the cage (with the mirror removed) and allowed them to regain full consciousness. He then recorded the frequency with which the chimpanzees spontaneously touched the marked areas of skin. After 30 minutes, the mirror was re-introduced into the room and the frequency of touching the marked areas again determined. The frequency of touching increased to 4–10 with the mirror present, compared to only 1 when the mirror had been removed. The chimpanzees sometimes inspected their fingers visually or olfactorily after touching the marks. Other mark-directed behaviour includes turning and adjusting of the body to better view the mark in the mirror, or tactile examination of the mark with an appendage while viewing the mirror.\n\nAn important aspect of the classical mark-test is that the mark/dye is non-tactile, preventing attention being drawn to the marking through additional perceptual cues (somesthesis). For this reason, animals in the majority of classical tests are anesthetised. Some tests use a tactile marker.\n\nAnimals that are considered to be able to recognise themselves in a mirror typically progress through four stages of behaviour when facing a mirror:\nGallup conducted a follow-up study in which two chimpanzees with no prior experience of a mirror were put under anesthesia, marked and observed. After recovery, they made no mark-directed behaviours either before or after being provided with a mirror.\n\nThe rouge test was also done by Michael Lewis and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn in 1979 for the purpose of self-recognition with human mothers and their children.\n\nA large number of studies using a wide range of species have investigated the occurrence of spontaneous, mark-directed behaviour when given a mirror, as originally proposed by Gallup. Most marked animals given a mirror initially respond with social behaviour, such as aggressive displays, and continue to do so during repeated testing. Only a small number of species have touched or directed behaviour toward the mark, thereby passing the classic MSR test.\n\nFindings in MSR studies are not always conclusive. Even in chimpanzees, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Prevalence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and aging individuals.\n\nUntil the 2008 study on magpies, self-recognition was thought to reside in the neocortex area of the brain. However, this brain region is absent in non-mammals. Self-recognition may be a case of convergent evolution, where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviours or traits, although species arrive at them via different routes, and the underlying mechanism may be different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA range of species have been exposed to mirrors. Although these might have failed the classic MSR test, they have sometimes shown mirror-related behaviour:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings for gorillas are mixed. At least four studies have reported that gorillas failed the MSR test. It has been suggested that the gorilla may be the only great ape \"which lacks the conceptual ability necessary for self-recognition\". Other studies have found more positive results, but have tested gorillas with extensive human contact, and required modification of the test by habituating the gorillas to the mirror and not using anaesthetic. Koko reportedly passed the MSR test, although this was without anaesthetic. In gorillas, protracted eye contact is an aggressive gesture and they may therefore fail the mirror test because they deliberately avoid making eye contact with their reflections. This could also explain why only gorillas with extensive human interaction and a certain degree of separation from other gorillas and usual gorilla behaviour are more predisposed to passing the test.\n\nTwo captive giant manta rays showed frequent, unusual and repetitive movements in front of a mirror suggested contingency checking. They also showed unusual self-directed behaviours when exposed to the mirror.\n\nPrimates, other than the great apes, have so far universally failed the mirror test. However, mirror tests with three species of gibbon (\"Hylobates syndactylus\", \"H.gabriellae\", \"H. leucogenys\") have shown convincing evidence of self-recognition despite the fact that the animals failed the standard version of the mirror test.\n\nRhesus macaques have failed the MSR test, but use mirrors to study otherwise-hidden parts of their bodies, such as their genitals and the implants in their heads. It has been suggested this demonstrates at least a partial self-awareness, although this is disputed.\n\nPigs can use visual information seen in a mirror to find food, and show evidence of self-recognition when presented with their reflection. In an experiment, 7 of the 8 pigs tested were able to find a bowl of food hidden behind a wall and revealed using a mirror. The eighth pig looked behind the mirror for the food. BBC Earth also showed the foodbowl test, and the \"matching shapes to holes\" test, in the Extraordinary Animals series.\n\nB. F. Skinner found that Pigeons are capable of passing a highly modified mirror test after extensive training. In the experiment, a pigeon was trained to look in a mirror to find a response key behind it, which the pigeon then turned to peck to obtain food. Thus, the pigeon learned to use a mirror to find critical elements of its environment. Next, the pigeon was trained to peck at dots placed on its feathers; food was, again, the consequence of touching the dot. The latter training was accomplished in the absence of the mirror. The final test was placing a small bib on the pigeon—enough to cover a dot placed on its lower belly. A control period without the mirror present yielded no pecking at the dot. When the mirror was revealed, the pigeon became active, looked in the mirror and then tried to peck on the dot under the bib. However, untrained pigeons have never passed the mirror test.\n\nManta rays repeatedly swim in front of the mirror, turning over to show their undersides and moving their fins. When in front of the mirror, they blow bubbles, an unusual behaviour. They do not try to socially interact with the mirror image, suggesting that they recognise that the mirror image is not another ray. However, a classic mirror test using marks on the rays’ bodies has yet to be done.\n\nIn 2012, early steps were taken to make a robot pass the mirror test.\n\nThe MSR test has been criticised for several reasons, in particular, because it may result in findings that are false negatives.\n\nThe MSR test may be of limited value when applied to species that primarily use senses other than vision. For example, dogs mainly use olfaction and audition; vision is used only third. It is suggested this is why dogs fail the MSR test. With this in mind, the biologist Marc Bekoff developed a scent-based paradigm using dog urine to test self-recognition in canines. He tested his own dog, but his results were inconclusive. Dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz formalized Bekoff's idea in a controlled experiment, reported on in 2016 and published in 2017. She compared the dogs' behavior when examining their own and others' odors, and also when examining their own odor with an added smell \"mark\" analogous to the visual mark in MSR tests. These subjects not only discriminated their own odor from that of other dogs, as Bekoff had found, but also spent more time investigating their own odor \"image\" when it was modified, as subjects who pass the MSR test do. A 2016 study suggested an ethological approach, the \"Sniff test of self-recognition (STSR)\" which may shed light on different ways of checking for self-recognition.\n\nAnother concern with the MSR test is that some species quickly respond aggressively to their mirror reflection as if it were a threatening conspecific thereby preventing the animal to calmly consider what the reflection actually represents. It has been suggested this is the reason why gorillas and monkeys fail the MSR test.\n\nIn a MSR test, animals may not recognise the mark as abnormal, or, may not be sufficiently motivated to react to it. However, this does not mean they are unable to recognise themselves. For example, in a MSR test conducted on three elephants, only one elephant passed the test but the two elephants that failed still demonstrated behaviours that can be interpreted as self-recognition. The researchers commented that the elephants might not have touched the mark because it was not important enough to them. Similarly, lesser apes infrequently engage in self-grooming, which may explain their failure to touch a mark on their head in the mirror test.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that there has been controversy over whether self-recognition implies self-awareness. The ant researchers state that many ants, from three species, pass the mirror test, but the researchers do not know that they have self-awareness. Dogs recognize their own scent as different from others' scents, but fail the mirror test.\n\nThe \"rouge test\" is a version of the mirror test used with human children. Using rouge makeup, an experimenter surreptitiously places a dot on the face of the child. The child is then placed in front of a mirror and their reactions are monitored; depending on the child's development, distinct categories of responses are demonstrated. This test is widely cited as the primary measure for mirror self-recognition in human children.\n\nFrom the age of 6 to 12 months, the child typically sees a \"sociable playmate\" in the mirror's reflection. Self-admiring and embarrassment usually begin at 12 months, and at 14 to 20 months most children demonstrate avoidance behaviours. Finally, at 18 months half of children recognise the reflection in the mirror as their own and by 20 to 24 months self-recognition climbs to 65%. Children do so by evincing mark-directed behaviour; they touch their own nose or try to wipe the mark off.\n\nIt appears that self-recognition in mirrors is independent of familiarity with reflecting surfaces. In some cases the rouge test has been shown to have differing results, depending on sociocultural orientation. For example, a Cameroonian Nso sample of infants 18 to 20 months of age had an extremely low amount of self-recognition outcomes at 3.2%. The study also found two strong predictors of self-recognition: object stimulation (maternal effort of attracting the attention of the infant to an object either person touched) and mutual eye contact. A strong correlation between self-concept and object permanence have also been demonstrated using the rouge test.\n\nThe rouge test is a measure of self-concept; the child who touches the rouge on his own nose upon looking into a mirror demonstrates the basic ability to understand self-awareness. Animals, young children, and people who have their sight restored after being blind from birth, sometimes react to their reflection in the mirror as though it were another individual.\n\nTheorists have remarked on the significance of this period in a child's life. For example, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan used a similar test in marking the mirror stage when growing up. Current views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and social identity.\n\nThere is some debate as to the interpretation of the results of the mirror test, and researchers in one study have identified some potential problems with the test as a means of gauging self-awareness in young children and animals.\n\nProposing that a self-recognising child or animal may not demonstrate mark-directed behaviour because they are not motivated to clean up their faces, thus providing incorrect results, the study compared results of the standard rouge test methodology against a modified version of the test.\n\nIn the classic test, the experimenter first played with the children, making sure that they looked in the mirror at least three times. Then, the rouge test was performed using a dot of rouge below the child's right eye. For their modified testing, the experimenter introduced a doll with a rouge spot under its eye and asked the child to help clean the doll. The experimenter would ask up to three times before cleaning the doll themselves. The doll was then put away, and the mirror test performed using a rouge dot on the child's face. These modifications were shown to increase the number of self-recognisers.\n\nThe results uncovered by this study at least suggest some issues with the classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot did not lead to them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its own face. The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.\n\nOn a more general level, it remains debatable whether recognition of one's mirror image implies self-awareness. Likewise, the converse may also be false—one may hold self-awareness, but not present a positive result in a mirror test.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72197", "title": "Nothing", "text": "Nothing\n\n\"Nothing\", used as a pronoun subject, denotes the absence of a something or particular thing that one might expect or desire to be present (\"We found nothing,\" \"Nothing was there\") or the inactivity of a thing or things that are usually or could be active (\"Nothing moved,\" \"Nothing happened\"). As a predicate or complement \"nothing\" denotes the absence of meaning, value, worth, relevance, standing, or significance (\"It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing\"; \"The affair meant nothing\"; \"I'm nothing in their eyes\"). \"Nothingness\" is a philosophical term that denotes the general state of nonexistence, sometimes reified as a domain or dimension into which things pass when they cease to exist or out of which they may come to exist, e.g., God is understood to have created the universe \"ex nihilo\", \"out of nothing.\"\n\nSome would consider the study of \"nothing\" to be foolish. A typical response of this type is voiced by Giacomo Casanova (1725–1798) in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest:\n\nHowever, \"nothingness\" has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time. In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of \"nothing\", a phrase such as \"not-being\" is often employed to make clear what is being discussed.\n\nOne of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was Parmenides (5th century BC), who was a Greek philosopher of the monist school. He argued that \"nothing\" cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists. Since we can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concludes that there is no such thing as change. As a corollary, there can be no such things as \"coming-into-being\", \"passing-out-of-being\", or \"not-being\".\n\nParmenides was taken seriously by other philosophers, influencing, for instance, Socrates and Plato. Aristotle gives Parmenides serious consideration but concludes; \"Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts.\"\n\nIn modern times, Albert Einstein's concept of spacetime has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides. On the death of his friend Michele Besso, Einstein consoled his widow with the words \"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That signifies nothing. For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.\" \n\nLeucippus (early 5th century BC), one of the atomists, along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change. He accepted the monist position that there could be no motion without a void. The void is the opposite of being. It is \"not-being\". On the other hand, there exists something known as an absolute plenum, a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full. But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums. These are the invisibly small \"atoms\" of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by Democritus (circa 460 BC – 370 BC), which allows the void to \"exist\" between them. In this scenario, macroscopic objects can \"come-into-being\", move through space, and pass into \"not-being\" by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms. The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the \"frozen world\" of Parmenides must be accepted.\n\nBertrand Russell points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides' attempts to work from pure logic. Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot \"start\" in a plenum. Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a \"thing\" (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist. Leucippus is therefore the first to say that \"nothing\" has a reality attached to it.\n\nAristotle (384–322 BC) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are \"matter\" and things that are \"space\". In this scenario, space is not \"nothing\" but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed. The true void (as \"nothing\") is different from \"space\" and is removed from consideration.\n\nThis characterisation of space reached its pinnacle with Isaac Newton who asserted the existence of absolute space.\n\nRené Descartes, on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides-like argument of denying the existence of space. For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of \"nothing\".\n\nThe idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning. Although Descartes views on this were challenged by Blaise Pascal, he declined to overturn the traditional belief, \"horror vacui\", commonly stated as \"nature abhors a vacuum\". This remained so until Evangelista Torricelli invented the barometer in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down. This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the torr, being named after him. Even Torricelli's teacher, the famous Galileo Galilei had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.\n\nJohn the Scot, or Johannes Scotus Eriugena (c. 815–877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him. His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating pseudo-Dionysius. His beliefs are essentially pantheist and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into \"not-being\". This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world. Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of \"nothing\" is to be interpreted as meaning that the \"nothing\" here is synonymous with God.\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) is the philosopher who brought the dialectical method to a new pinnacle of development. According to Hegel in \"Science of Logic\", the dialectical methods consists of three steps. First, a thesis is given, which can be any proposition in logic. Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis. Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true. Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition. Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue. The concept of \"nothing\" arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his \"Logic\". The whole is called by Hegel the \"Absolute\" and is to be viewed as something spiritual. Hegel then has:\n\nThe most prominent figure among the existentialists is Jean-Paul Sartre, whose ideas in his book \"Being and Nothingness\" (\"L'être et le néant\") are heavily influenced by \"Being and Time\" (\"Sein und Zeit\") of Martin Heidegger, although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre. Sartre defines two kinds of \"being\" (être). One kind is \"être-en-soi\", the brute existence of things such as a tree. The other kind is \"être-pour-soi\" which is consciousness. Sartre claims that this second kind of being is \"nothing\" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence. Sartre, and even more so, Jaques Lacan, use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.\n\nThe understanding of 'nothing' varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, \"Śūnyatā\" (emptiness), unlike \"nothingness\", is considered to be a state of mind in some forms of Buddhism (see Nirvana, mu, and Bodhi). Achieving 'nothing' as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were consciously thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre, although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.\n\nIn some Eastern philosophies, the concept of \"nothingness\" is characterized by an egoless state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos.\n\nThe Kyoto School handles the concept of nothingness as well.\n\nIn computing, \"nothing\" can be a keyword (in VB.Net) used in place of something unassigned, a data abstraction. Although a computer's storage hardware always contains numbers, \"nothing\" symbolizes a number skipped by the system when the programmer desires. Many systems have similar capabilities but different keywords, such as \"null\" (e.g. SQL), \"NUL\", \"nil\", and \"None\" (Python).\n\nTo instruct a computer processor to do nothing, a keyword such as \"NOP\" may be available. This is a control abstraction; a processor that executes NOP will behave identically to a processor that does not process this directive.\n\n\n"}

Parameshwara is the ultimate reality and nothing exists that is non one with Paramashiva. He is the totality controlling the triple forces of creation, preservation and destruction.\n\nThe word is a compound of the Sanskrit words \"parama\" meaning 'highest' and ईश्वर \"īśvára\" meaning 'lord'. Thus Parameshvara literally means 'highest supreme ruler '. Similarly, the word Paramashiva (Parama + Shiva) means 'Shiva in his highest nature'. These two words are simultaneously used in Saivite texts as synonyms for Parabrahman, the Indian equivalent of Supreme being. Sometimes, other traditions of Hinduism such as Vedanta and Vaishnavism also use the term Parameshwara as a synonym of Parabrahman within their philosophical perspectives. \n\nKashmiri Shaivism describes all of reality, with all of its diversity and fluctuation, is the play of the single principle, Paramashiva. The two aspects of this single reality are inseparably united: Shiva and Shakti. Paramashiva \"appears\" as the world through his creative power, Shakti. The ontological nature of Paramashiva is beyond human knowledge and articulation, yet it can be experienced directly through mystical intuition. \n\nShaiva siddanta accepts the existence of \"Tripathartham\" (three entities), pati - the supreme being Paramashiva, pashu - all atmans and pasam - three bondages of Anava, Karma, Maya. As the supreme being Parameshwara only has the distinct eight characters or predecates which are applied to distinguish him with the other two entities of Saiva Siddhanta - Pashu and Pasam. They are \"sarvajnatva\" (who knows everything), \"nityatrptatva\" (with infinite happiness), \"anādibōdha\" (without bondages), \"Svatantratva\" (independent), \"aluptashakti\" (unlimited mercy), \"anantashakti\" (unrestricted grace), \"nirāmayatma\" (wholesome) and \"Visuddhadēha\" (with pure body).\n\nShaiva siddhanta states that Parameshwara in two states - \"tatasta lakshanam\", the form of lord that is moving through 36 tattvas and \"Svarupa Lakshanam\", the pure form of supreme being beyond everything. These two forms can be compared with the Saguna and Nirguna definitions on Para brahman of Vedantic tradition. When he is defined with tatasta lakshanam, Paramashiva exists in nine divine forms, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Maheshwara, Sadasiva, Sivam, Shakti, Nadam, Bindhu in which he is beyond words in his last four formless manifestations known as \"Arupa\". First five are his manifestations with forms and known as \"rupa\". Sadasiva is his mixed form of rupa and arupa which is often identified with Lingam. Sivam and sakthi exist as inseparable Nada-bindu in the state of Svarupa Lakshanam in which they are often identified the non-dual supreme being Paramashiva and Parashakti. Since they are inseparable and undifferentiated, Saiva siddhanta sees them as single oneness, Parameshwara.\n\n"}

Personality disorder includes deviation in affectivity, cognition, control over impulses and need for gratification, ways of perceiving and thinking, and inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional behaviour. There must be personal distress attributable to such behaviour. Deviation must be stable and of long duration.\n\nIn psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non-active resistance to expected work requirements, opposition, sullenness, stubbornness, and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others. Most frequently it occurs in the workplace, where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors as procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by authority figures, but it can also occur in interpersonal contexts.\n\nAnother source characterizes passive-aggressive behavior as: \"a personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive, sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations. Behaviors: learned helplessness, procrastination, stubbornness, resentment, sullenness, or deliberate/repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is (often explicitly) responsible\". Other examples of passive-aggressive behavior might include avoiding direct or clear communication, evading problems, fear of intimacy or competition, making excuses, blaming others, obstructionism, \"playing the victim\", feigning compliance with requests, sarcasm, backhanded compliments, and hiding anger.\n\nIn conflict theory, passive-aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as catty, as it consists of deliberate, active, but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non-assertive style of passive resistance.\n\nPassive-aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity. In the ad for Warner's online ebook, it says: \"The worst case of passive-aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity, sullenness, resentment, procrastination, 'forgetting' to do something, chronic lateness, and intentional inefficiency.\" If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers. If managers are passive-aggressive in their behavior, it can end up stifling team creativity. De Angelis says, \"It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable, diplomatic and supportive, yet who are actually dishonest, backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes.\"\n\nPassive-aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel William Menninger during World War II in the context of men's reaction to military compliance. Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their aggressiveness \"by passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism\" due to what Menninger saw as an \"immaturity\" and a reaction to \"routine military stress\".\n\nAccording to some psychoanalytic views, noncompliance is not indicative of true passive-aggressive behavior, which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self-imposed need for acceptance.\n\n\n"}

It was the last book he finished in his lifetime, running to some 90 pages of a single long essay. It is commonly referred to as his \"Freiheitsschrift\" (freedom text) or \"freedom essay\".\n\nDescribed by Hans Urs von Balthasar as \"the most titanic work of German idealism\", it is also seen as anticipating much of the collection of basic existentialist motifs. Its ambitions were high: to tackle the problem of radical evil, and to innovate at a metaphysical level, in particular to correct dualism. As its title suggests, it intends to give an account of human freedom, and the requirements on the philosophical side to protect this idea from particular formulations, at issue during the period, of determinism.\n\nThe literature on the history of philosophy contains many assertions about the general influences on Schelling. There are also more specific comments about other thinkers and traditions that had a definite effect on this transitional work. The opening pages make it clear that Schelling is engaged in arguing against Spinozism, a position which (often simply called \"dogmatism\") had been a target for both philosophical and religious thinkers in Germany for decades. Schelling was not concerned about rejecting all that Baruch Spinoza's thought implied, in the terms of that debate, but to salvage something from the unification of view (monism) that came with it, while allowing room for freedom.\n\nAt this time Schelling was influenced also by Franz Xaver von Baader and the writings of Jakob Böhme. In fact \"Of Human Freedom\" contains explicit references to Baader's doctrine of evil, and Böhme's schematic creation myths, and uses the term theosophy; a detailed mapping of Böhme's thought onto Schelling's argument in the \"Freiheitsschrift\" has been carried out by Paola Mayer. On the other hand Robert Schneider and Ernst Benz have argued for the more direct influence of the pietist Johann Albrecht Bengel and theosophist Friedrich Christoph Oetinger.\n\nExplicit concerns of Schelling in the book are: the existence of evil and the emergence into reason. Schelling offers a solution to the first, an old theological chestnut, in brief that “evil makes arbitrary choice possible”. On the other hand, by no means all interpretations of the work come from the direction of theology and the problem of evil. The second idea, requiring a rationale of emergence, was more innovative, because of the place it gave to irrationalism and anthropomorphism, within the \"cosmic\" setting (which need not be taken literally). The work stands also in relation to a decade of previous publications, formulations, and rivalries.\n\nA view from the nineteenth century is that of Harald Høffding (who sets the book in the context of a supposed personal crisis and philosophical block):\n\nModern readings of Schelling's intentions can differ quite widely from this interpretation (and each other). This writing of Schelling is also seen as the beginning of his critique of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and an announcement of a transitional moment in philosophy; part of the purpose was self-justification, verging on polemic in defence of Schelling's panentheism. It is therefore a signpost marking a fork in the road for what is now called \"classical German philosophy\": even if it had its time of dominance, absolute idealism in Hegel's sense is (after the \"freedom essay\") just one branch of the discussion of the Absolute in German idealism. Hegel became a system-builder while Schelling produced no systematic or finished philosophy in three decades after the \"Freiheitsschrift\".\n\nThe conception of evil is set against both the Neoplatonic \"privatio boni\" and the Manichaean division into two disconnected and contending powers. Evil must be seen as active, in both God and natural creatures. There is a distinction: in God evil can never stray out of its place (at the base), while in man it certainly may exceed its role of basing self-hood.\n\nSlavoj Žižek writes that the central tenet is that\n\nJohn W. Cooper writes\n\nAt the time of writing the \"Freiheitschrift\", Schelling had on his mind an accusation of pantheism, levelled at him by Friedrich Schlegel in \"Über Sprache und Weisheit der Indier\" (1808). The German Pantheism controversy of the 1780s continued to cast a long shadow. F. H. Jacobi, who had launched it, was someone with whom Schelling was in contact in Munich, where the book was written.\n\nIn his book, Schelling takes up the issue of pantheism, concerned to refute the idea that it necessarily leads to fatalism, so negating human freedom. Here he is closer to Spinoza, erasing the distinction between nature and God. On the other hand, Schelling is trying to overcome the distinction made in Spinoza's system, between \"natura naturans\" (dynamic) and \"natura naturata\" (passive). Schelling wanted to locate the fatalism in Spinoza, not in the pantheism or monism, but in his formulation.\n\nAccording to Andrew Bowie:\n\nSchelling considered that the idealist conception of freedom, in Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, had remained undeveloped, absent a cleaner break with the rationalist systems of Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, and a distinctive theory of its human element. In another view of the book's main theme, leading onto the further development of the philosophy of the \"Weltalter\" (Ages of the World), Schelling\n\nIn this approach, the Absolute takes on a darker side, and shows therefore the connection to the theme of the problem of evil. This aspect then pervades all life:\n\nThis is an approximate summary of the content of the \"Freiheitsschrift\" using page numbering as appears in Schelling's \"Works\". There is no division except into paragraphs.\n\n\nSchelling placed the \"Freiheitsschrift\" at the end of the first volume of his \"Sämmtliche Werke\" (Collected Works). The correct periodisation of his philosophy is still a contentious area, and there are differing views of what kind of punctuation mark it really represents in Schelling's work. It is admittedly important that the book itself begins with an outright rejection of “system”. The publication of this book is said, on the one hand, to mark the beginning of Schelling's “middle period”. As such it marks the break with the “identity philosophy” on which he worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century, after his beginnings as a follower of Johann Fichte and developer of \"Naturphilosophie\".\n\nThe divergence of Schelling and Hegel becomes clear from around this year, with Hegel's ambitions being systematic and explicitly encyclopedic, notions of freedom being quite different, and the use of dialectic becoming obviously distinct on the two sides. Hegel's star was in the ascendent, while Schelling's other road led into the wilderness, at least as far as academic respectability was concerned. Academic recognition for Schelling's work as important to philosophy, as opposed to an idiosyncratic contribution to philosophy of religion, was indeed slow to come. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, one of Schelling's contemporaries and followers, rated it highly.\n\nIn 1936, Martin Heidegger gave a series of lectures on Schelling's freedom essay. These were published in German in 1971 and translated into English in 1984. Heidegger largely treated the \"Freiheitschrift\" as continuous with the \"identity philosophy\" period leading up to it. Heidegger by 1941 had hardened his line to the position that Schelling is still a theorist of an enclosing subjectivity, while treating the \"Freiheitsschrift\" as the apex (\"Gipfel\") of the metaphysics of German idealism. This view is still contested: other authors read the book as the start of something new in philosophy. Schelling's \"Stuttgart Vorlesungen\" of 1810 reformulate and build on the freedom essay, and the \"Weltalter\" manuscripts go further in trying to work out details of the Behmenist insights. The debate is therefore really whether the \"Freiheitschrift\" is culminating, seminal, or possibly both.\n\n\n"}

A smooth formula_1-dimensional manifold is a quasitoric manifold if it admits a smooth, locally standard action of an formula_2-dimensional torus, with orbit space an formula_2-dimensional simple convex polytope.\n\nQuasitoric manifolds were introduced in 1991 by M. Davis and T. Januszkiewicz, who called them \"toric manifolds\". However, the term \"quasitoric manifold\" was eventually adopted to avoid confusion with the class of compact smooth toric varieties, which are known to algebraic geometers as toric manifolds.\n\nQuasitoric manifolds are studied in a variety of contexts in algebraic topology, such as complex cobordism theory, and the other oriented cohomology theories.\n\nDenote the formula_4-th subcircle of the formula_2-torus formula_6 by formula_7 so that formula_8. Then coordinate-wise multiplication of formula_6 on formula_10 is called the standard representation.\n\nGiven open sets formula_11 in formula_12 and formula_13 in formula_10, that are closed under the action of formula_6, a formula_16-action on formula_12 is defined to be locally isomorphic to the standard representation if formula_18, for all formula_19 in formula_6, formula_21 in formula_11, where formula_23 is a homeomorphism formula_24, and formula_25 is an automorphism of formula_6.\n\nGiven a simple convex polytope formula_27 with formula_28 facets, a formula_6-manifold formula_12 is a quasitoric manifold over formula_27 if,\n\n\nThe definition implies that the fixed points of formula_12 under the formula_6-action are mapped to the vertices of formula_27 by formula_43, while points where the action is free project to the interior of the polytope.\n\nA quasitoric manifold can be described in terms of a dicharacteristic function and an associated dicharacteristic matrix. In this setting it is useful to assume that the facets formula_44 of formula_27 are ordered so that the intersection formula_46 is a vertex formula_47 of formula_48, called the initial vertex.\n\nA dicharacteristic function is a homomorphism formula_49, such that if formula_50 is a codimension-formula_51 face of formula_27, then formula_53 is a monomorphism on restriction to the subtorus formula_54 in formula_55.\n\nThe restriction of λ to the subtorus formula_56 corresponding to the initial vertex formula_47 is an isomorphism, and so formula_58 can be taken to be a basis for the Lie algebra of formula_6. The epimorphism of Lie algebras associated to λ may be described as a linear transformation formula_60, represented by the formula_61 dicharacteristic matrix formula_62 given by\n\nThe formula_4th column of formula_62 is a primitive vector formula_66 in formula_67, called the facet vector. As each facet vector is primitive, whenever the facets formula_68 meet in a vertex, the corresponding columns formula_69 form a basis of formula_67, with determinant equal to formula_71. The isotropy subgroup associated to each facet formula_72 is described by\n\nfor some formula_74 in formula_75.\n\nIn their original treatment of quasitoric manifolds, Davis and Januskiewicz introduced the notion of a characteristic function that mapped each facet of the polytope to a vector determining the isotropy subgroup of the facet, but this is only defined up to sign. In more recent studies of quasitoric manifolds, this ambiguity has been removed by the introduction of the dicharacteristic function and its insistence that each circle formula_76 be oriented, forcing a choice of sign for each vector formula_77. The notion of the dicharacteristic function was originally introduced V. Buchstaber and N. Ray to enable the study of quasitoric manifolds in complex cobordism theory. This was further refined by introducing the ordering of the facets of the polytope to define the initial vertex, which eventually leads to the above neat representation of the dicharacteristic matrix formula_62 as formula_79, where formula_80 is the identity matrix and formula_81 is an formula_82 submatrix.\n\nThe kernel formula_83 of the dicharacteristic function acts freely on the moment angle complex formula_84, and so defines a principal formula_83-bundle formula_86 over the resulting quotient space formula_12. This quotient space can be viewed as\n\nwhere pairs formula_89, formula_90 of formula_91 are identified if and only if formula_92 and formula_93 is in the image of formula_53 on restriction to the subtorus formula_95 that corresponds to the unique face formula_96 of formula_27 containing the point formula_98, for some formula_99.\n\nIt can be shown that any quasitoric manifold formula_12 over formula_27 is equivariently diffeomorphic to a quasitoric manifold of the form of the quotient space above.\n\n\nThe moment angle complex formula_109 is the formula_110-sphere formula_111, the kernel formula_83 is the diagonal subgroup formula_113, so the quotient of formula_109 under the action of formula_83 is formula_103.\n\n\nfor integers formula_124.\n\nThe moment angle complex formula_125 is a product of formula_2 copies of 3-sphere embedded in formula_127, the kernel formula_83 is given by\n\nso that the quotient of formula_125 under the action of formula_83 is the formula_2-th stage of a Bott tower.

Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, \"A Thousand Plateaus\". Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari.\n\nIn \"Chaosmosis\", Guattari explains that \"rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex\", schizoanalysis \"will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation, in short towards its ontological heterogeneity\".\n\nSchizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of Sigmund Freud—namely, the use of the Oedipus complex as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new \"assemblages [\"agencements\"] of enunciation\" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations.\n\nBy the time of \"Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis\" (1973), Deleuze said \"we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape\".\n\nSchizoanalysis can be represented by four circular components that bud and form rhizomes:\n\n\nSchizoanalysis also proposes a novel take on sexuality inasmuch as it concerns an analysis of the \"\"n\" sexes\" of a subject.\n\n\n"}

In Europe, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the emergence of new states and sustained efforts to pursue the European Union (EU) integration. The new order called for a (re)conceptualisation of Europe and European security, which challenged classic understandings of security, as something that took place between states. The move towards an EU security was, thus, closely articulated around questions of EU identity, free movement of people and borders. \nThe concept of societal security, developed by scholars associated with the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute, is situated within this context. Societal security relates to: \"the ability of a society to persist in its essential character under changing conditions and possible or actual threats.\"\n\nIn 'Identity, Migration, and the New Security Agenda in Europe', Wæver notes the emergence of different conceptions of the nation-state, and further establishes a distinction between Western and Eastern Europe. In the West, a “decoupling of state and nation” takes place, as member states, by seeking more integration, accept to relinquish some of their sovereignty. This move towards a “post-sovereign” nation-state is due to “internationalisation and Europeanization” processes, as international institutions assume increased influence over domestic affairs. Subsequently, communities, perceiving their identities to be threatened by this integration, can no longer call upon the state to protect them. A duality occurs between the security needs of the state and of society, where “state security has sovereignty as its ultimate criterion, and societal security has identity”. In the East, the emergence of new states, formed after the dismantlement of the Soviet Union, leads to more traditional attempts at merging the nation and the state; thus, conflicts arise when the coupling cannot be done (i.e. Yugoslavia).\n\nIn 'Security: a new framework for analysis', Buzan et al. formalise their broader understanding of security by introducing five sectors, each governed by “distinctive characteristics and dynamics”, and conceptualised around particular referent objects and actors (i.e. military, environmental, economic, societal and political). Societal security is about the survival of a community as a cohesive unit; its referent object is ”large scale collective identities that can function independent of the state.”\nSocietal insecurities arise when “a society fears it would not be able to live as itself”, and stem from:\n\nSocietal security is not tied to a territory, as is state security, e.g. Kurds, where security matters of state and society widely diverge and enter into conflict.\n\nSocietal security in sociological viewpoint is:\n\nRegarding security as an \"independent phenomenon\":\n\nSo, societal security isn't threat, no opportunity. But it is a center and base, upon it the reliability and certainty of collective life could be gained.\n\nRereading of security from \"social\" perspective:\n\nIt means that security is based on collective life, the life of common people, instead of looking at differences and insisting on disagreement between groups and states that is key factor in determining threats and distinguish friend and foe.\n\nViewing security as \"social phenomenon\":\n\nHence, societal security doesn't need military weapons and soft power solutions. In other words, societal security doesn't integrate with power and remain by converting links to social capitals.\n\nFinally, threats and opportunities could be considered as deterrent or impeller factors.\n\nSo the final goal of societal security is comfort and understanding the beauty of collective life – not an interest for government, not eliminating enemies, not confronting a threat for nation.\n\nA community, acting upon these insecurities, will try to present an issue as being an existential threat endangering the survival of a group. Thus, securitization is a tactic that seeks to categorise an issue as an existential threat, for its prioritisation over any other issue (i.e. “absolute priority”). Addressing any other issue would be pointless, if the existential threat is not addressed first. Thereby, securitization justifies and legitimises the use of exceptional measures.\n\nMaking use of language theory, securitization is conceptualised as a speech-act, and as such, relies on linguistic techniques and audiences. The message has to be properly delivered (e.g. using appropriate vocabulary, framing, diffusion channels, etc.) for an audience to accept it. \n\nNot all speech-act are successful. They have to be uttered by those holding enough social capital to be heard and taken seriously. Successful societal security speech-acts can only be uttered by the elites of specific communities. Because of their existential nature, only few claims can be successfully securitised.\n\nThe concept of societal security developed by the Copenhagen School has been subject to several academic criticisms. Theiler argues that when discussing societal security there is a tendency to reify societies as independent social agents. Theiler also states that a too vague definition of identity is deployed when discussing the concept and there is a failure to 'demonstrate sufficiently that social security matters to individuals'.\n\nFurthermore, understanding exceptional measures as extremely politicised responses and/or measures outside politics is problematic, as it implies different frames of action within a large scale of possible. What constitutes “normal politics”? Are these measures outside or within the frame of the law? Do they apply to everyone or only to a specific group? Do they hold policy implication? These questions are particularly relevant to appreciate the types of security measures a securitization through societal security could bring, i.e. what could a community do by securitising identities? Hence, this vagueness could indicate a decision not to engage with debates around exceptional measures or the limits of conceptualising the modus operandi of security measures outside of the state.\n\n\n"}

It is the intrinsic nature, essential nature or essence of living beings.\n\nThe concept and term \"svabhāva\" are frequently encountered in Hindu and Buddhist traditions such as Advaita Vedanta (e.g. in the \"Avadhūta Gītā\"), Mahayana Buddhism (e.g. in the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\"), Vaishnavism (e.g., the writings of Ramanuja) and Dzogchen (e.g. in the seventeen tantras).\n\nIn the nondual Advaita Vedānta yoga text, \"Avadhūta Gītā\", Brahman (in the Upanishadic denotation) is the \"sabhāva\".\n\nIn the Mahāyāna Buddhadharma tradition(s) it is one of a suite of terms employed to denote the Buddha-nature, such as \"gotra\".\n\nThe term first appears in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, as a possible first cause (\"jagatkāraṇa\"). There also seems to have been an Indian philosophical position called \"Svabhāvavada\" which was akin to naturalism which held that \"things are as their nature makes them\". It is possible this position was similar to or associated with Carvaka.\n\nIn early Samkhya philosophy, Svabhava was a term which was associated with Prakṛti. It is the inherent capacity of Prakṛti, which is independent and self caused. \n\nThe \"Bhagavad Gītā\" (18.41) has nature (\"svabhava\") as a distinguishing quality differentiating the \"varṇā\".\n\nOverzee (1992: p. 74) in her work on Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) and Rāmānuja (1017–1137) highlights Rāmānuja's usage of \"svabhāva\" in relation to Brahman thus:\nLet us look more closely at what Rāmānuja means by the Lord's \"nature\". If you read his writings, you will find that he uses two distinct yet related words when referring to the nature of Brahman: \"svarūpa\" and \"svabhāva\".\n\nIn early Theravādin texts, the term \"svabhāva\" did not carry the technical meaning or the soteriological weight of later writings. Much of Mahayana Buddhism (as in the \"Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\") denies that such a \"svabhāva\" exists within any being; however, in the tathāgatagarbha sūtras, notably the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\", the Buddha states that the immortal and infinite Buddha-nature - or \"true self\" of the Buddha - is the indestructible \"svabhāva\" of beings.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, \"sabhāva\" is absent from what are generally considered to be the earliest texts. When found in later texts (e.g., the paracanonical \"Milindapañha)\", it generically refers to state (of mind), character or truth.\n\nIn the post-canonical Abhidhamma literature, \"sabhāva\" is used to distinguish an irreducible, dependent, momentary phenomenon (\"dhamma\") from a conventionally constructed object. Thus, a collection of visual and tactile phenomena might be mentally constructed into what is conventionally referred to as a \"table\"; but, beyond its constituent elements, a construct such as \"table\" lacks intrinsic existence (\"sabhāva\").\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, svabhava in the Theravada Abhidhamma is something conditional and interdependent:\nThe Vaibhāṣika school held that dharmas have a constant essence or inherent nature (\"svabhāva\") which persists through past, present and future. The term was also identified as a unique mark or own characteristic (\"svalaksana\") that differentiated a dharma and remained unchangeable throughout its existence. According to Vaibhāṣikas, \"svabhavas\" are those things that exist substantially (\"dravyasat\") as opposed to those things which are made up of aggregations of dharmas and thus only have a nominal existence (\"prajñaptisat\"). \n\nRobinson (1957: p. 300) in discussing the Buddhist logic of Nāgārjuna, states:\nDzogchen upholds a view of \"niḥsvabhāva\", refuting \"svabhāva\" using the same logic employed by Madhyamaka, a freedom from extremes demonstrated succinctly via Catuṣkoṭi Tetralemma. \nIn the context of logical analysis, Dzogchen agrees with the view of Madhyamaka as elucidated by Nāgārjuna, Chögyal Namkhai Norbu explains:\n\nThe \"Union of the Sun and Moon\" (), one of the 'Seventeen tantras of the esoteric instruction cycle' () which are a suite of tantras known variously as: Nyingtik, Upadesha or Menngagde within Dzogchen discourse, states:\n\n<br>\n\n\"Svabhāva\" is very important in the nontheistic theology of the Bonpo Great Perfection (Dzogchen) tradition where it is part of a technical language to render macrocosm and microcosm into nonduality, as Rossi (1999: p. 58) states:\nThe term \"\"svabhāva\" is mentioned in six verses of the first chapter of the \"Avadhūta Gītā\": , , , , , .\n\nThis extreme nondual yoga text shares a lot of common language with the extreme nondual yoga of Atiyoga (Dzogchen) and its standard Tibetan analogue \"rang-bzhin\" (Wylie) is employed in \"The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra,\" one of the \"Seventeen Tantras\" of Atiyoga Upadesha.\n\nDzogchen strictly refutes the notion of \"svabhāva\"\", and so \"The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra,\" states specifically that dharmakāya is non-arisen and natureless:\n\n<br>\n\nThe following quotation from \"The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra\" is drawn from the Lungi Terdzö:\nDzogchen teacher Namkhai Norbu (2001: p. 155) in discussing the view of the pratyekabuddhas states that: \n\n\n"}

It also discusses ethical dilemmas in the education system of the time. \"The Book of the Governor\" is evidence of the impact that Renaissance humanism had on prose writing.\n\nThomas Elyot was born before 1490 and died in 1546. He was the son of Sir Richard Elyot and Alice Fynderne. His father was a prominent lawyer, so Thomas received a quality education. Both Cambridge and Oxford claim him as an alumnus, but there is no sufficient evidence either way. He studied mostly liberal arts and philosophy, but also some medicine. In 1510 he married Margaret Aborough. In 1530 he was knighted. In 1531, he was made ambassador to the Emperor, Charles V. In 1538 he published the first Latin-English dictionary. As a writer, he is clear, precise, measured, and practically monotonous. His major works include:\n\n\"The Boke named the Governour\" is considered to be the first educational treatise in English. It sets out the way of life for member of the English governing class. Between 1531 and 1580, the book went through seven different editions. According to Biblio.com, the Book of the Governor \"went through edition after edition all through the sixteenth century. It achieved this fame for many reasons. It is the first work in recognizably modern English prose, to which Elyot added many new words. It provided influential advocacy for the study of the classics, from which he quotes extensively. the principal cause of its popularity was the current vogue for its subject – it is a treatise on moral philosophy, laying down the lines on which the education of those destined to govern should be directed, and inculcating the high moral principles which should rule them in the performance of their duties. There was nothing very original or revolutionary in the thoughts expressed: Elyot acknowledges his debt to the \"Institutio Principis Christiani\" of Erasmus and Castiglione’s \"Il Cortegiano\", though not that to Francesco Patrizzi, Bishop of Gaeta at the end of the fifteenth century, whose \"De Rego et Regis Institutione\" was certainly the model for \"The Governour\". Nevertheless it remained a textbook for behaviour for generations and had a lasting effect on the writing of English.\"\n\nElyot wrote his book at the beginning of English Renaissance humanism. During this time, \"humanists were distinguished from other scholars not by exclusive focus on human or secular texts, but rather by their focus on secular writings, particularly classical ones, \"as well as\" on religious texts and thoughts\". It was during this time that the Greek and Roman classics were finally coming back. This is the time when Plato played a significant role in philosophical history. Renaissance humanism also introduced a new richness in the English language – writers began to use rhetoric, and language was viewed as a worthy subject to study. This is why Elyot's book became so popular not only with the people, but also the King.\n\n"}

It was included in the 8th volume of the author's \"Collected Writings.\" In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded Subba Row medal.\n\nAn American author Gary Lachman, noting Blavatsky's \"animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos,\" has cited her article in which she writes that \"Christianity is now the religion of arrogance \"par excellence,\" a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy.\" A Russian Indologist Alexander Senkevich has noted that she did not make secrets out of her \"skeptical attitude towards the Gospels,\" considering them unrelated to either Jesus or his Apostles. Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the Protestant camp there are 350 dissenting sects, and she commented that if \"one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false.\" A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are \"magazines of falsehoods,\" and all of them have served \n\nProfessor Robert Ellwood wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to \"the Church Fathers or modern priests, pastors and missionaries.\" The reason for her hostility to church Christianity \"was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness.\" She believed that \"churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the ancient wisdom.\"\n\nA Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls Lüd as the \"hometown\" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of Talmud that Jesus was the son of a man named Pandira and \"lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events.\" In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he \"was initiated\" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the Essenes, who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with \"He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of Passover.\"\n\nDrujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and Christos (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: \"Christ— the true esoteric Saviour—is no man, but the Divine Principle in every human being.\" Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: \"The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists.\" He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside \"all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God.\" The Russian \"Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians\" wrote that in her article Blavatsky \"allegorically\" proclaims: \"Christos was 'the Way,' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of 'Truth.'\" In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: \n\"To the true follower of the Spirit of Truth, it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages.\"\n\nTyson wrote that \"sanctification,\" in Blavatsky's opinion, \"was ever the synonym (for) the 'Mahatmic-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him.\" In this connection, he has said that Neoplatonic friars \"practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to,\" as Blavatsky writes, \"kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine Spirit in man.\"\n\nWhile studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the \"story of Jesus Christ,\" which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:\n\"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on Calvary? We say on the authority of the esoteric Eastern School, that all this came from the Gnostics, as far as the name Christos and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient Tanaïm as regards the Kabalistic connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications.\"\n\nAccording to French philosopher Édouard Schuré, Christian esotericism in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the \"Essenian and Gnostic traditions.\" A religious studies scholar Alvin Kuhn stated that the \"Gospels\" in ancient times were not \"the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine souls in the mortal body here on earth.\"\n\nThis article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally. Thus, a priest Drujinin (Russian Orthodox Church) claimed that the Theosophists \"had reduced\" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence. And moreover:\n\"The founders of Theosophy deny the importance of Christ's crucifixion. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts karma and reincarnation the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake.\"\nOn the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of Christ myth theory, stated that esotericism \"hung up midway\" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this \"anomalous\" situation: arguing in one place that \"Christ— the true esoteric Saviour—is no man, but the Divine Principle in every human being,\" she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the Jewish Adept Jesus. Kuhn proclaimed: \"The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not.\"\n\nAccording to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's \"onslaughts\" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to \"good works such as the Salvation Army, were not always even-handed.\" Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent liberal branch of Christian theology — \"Schleiermacher, Coleridge, Channing, Kingsley and many others\" who had nothing to do to the primitive \"dogmatism she so hated.\" Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the Theosophical Society connected with the formation of a \"new spirituality based on an immanent universalism\" which opposing aggressive religiosity \"she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Depending on the variation of The Game, the whole world, or all those aware of the game, are playing it all the time. Tactics have been developed to increase the number of people aware of The Game and thereby increase the number of losses.\n\nThere are three commonly reported rules to The Game:\n\n\nThe definition of \"thinking about The Game\" is not always clear. If one discusses The Game without realizing that they have lost, this may or may not constitute a loss. If someone says \"What is The Game?\" before understanding the rules, whether they have lost is up for interpretation. According to some interpretations, one does not lose when someone else announces their loss, although the second rule implies that one loses regardless of what made them think about The Game. After a player has announced a loss, or after one thinks of The Game, some variants allow for a grace period between three seconds to thirty minutes to forget about the game, during which the player cannot lose the game again.\n\nThe common rules do not define a point at which The Game ends. However, some players state that The Game ends when the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announces on television that \"The Game is up.\"\n\nStrategies focus on making others lose The Game. Common methods include saying \"The Game\" out loud or writing about The Game on a hidden note, in graffiti in public places, or on banknotes.\n\nAssociations may be made with The Game, especially over time, so that one thing inadvertently causes one to lose. Some players enjoy thinking of elaborate pranks that will cause others to lose the game.\n\nOther strategies involve merchandise: T-shirts, buttons, mugs, posters and bumper stickers have been created to advertise The Game. The Game is also spread via social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe origins of The Game are uncertain. In a 2008 news article, Justine Wettschreck says The Game has probably been around since the early 1990s, and may have originated in Australia or England. One theory is that it was invented in London in 1996 when two British engineers, Dennis Begley and Gavin McDowall, missed their last train and had to spend the night on the platform; they attempted to avoid thinking about their situation and whoever thought about it first lost. Another theory also traces The Game to London in 1996, when it was created by Jamie Miller \"to annoy people\". Journalist Mic Wright of \"The Next Web\" recalled playing The Game at school in the late 1990s.\n\nHowever, The Game may have been created in 1977 by members of the Cambridge University Science Fiction Society when attempting to create a game that did not fit in with game theory. A blog post by Paul Taylor in August 2002 described The Game; Taylor claimed to have \"found out about [the game] online about 6 months ago\". This is the earliest known reference on the internet.\n\nThe Game is most commonly spread through the internet, such as via Facebook or Twitter, or by word of mouth.\n\nThe Game is an example of ironic processing (also known as the \"White Bear Principle\"), in which attempts to avoid certain thoughts make those thoughts more persistent. There are early examples of ironic processing: in 1840, Leo Tolstoy played the \"white bear game\" with his brother, where he would \"stand in a corner and not think of the white bear\". Fyodor Dostoyevsky mentioned the same game in 1863 in the essay \"Winter Notes on Summer Impressions\".\n\nThe Game has been described as challenging and fun to play, and as pointless, childish and infuriating. In some Internet forums, such as Something Awful and GameSpy, and several schools, The Game has been banned.\n\nThe 2009 \"Time\" 100 poll was most likely manipulated by the hacktivist group Anonymous, so that the top 21 people's names formed an acrostic for \"marblecake also the game\", referencing The Game.\n\n"}

Vivid Projects was started soon after by the Vivid curatorial team and is based at Minerva Works in Digbeth.\n\nVivid commissioned and exhibited work both for its own exhibition space and for other locations, provided spaces and resources for the production of interdisciplinary art and hosted a programme of residencies for visiting artists, commissioned major new works and large scale touring exhibitions from artists including Haroon Mirza, Richard Billingham, Heather & Ivan Morison and exhibited artists from 1960 Fluxus movement to rising art stars. In 2008–11 it generated 27 international residencies and exhibitions with Vivid commissions presented at the Venice Biennale, Frieze Art Fair, The Art of Ideas and British Art Show 7; and touring to London and Gothenburg.\n\nVivid produced and curated emerging and mid-career artists and presented their work in local, national and international contexts. Described in \"The Guardian\" as 'superb' the critically acclaimed public programme presented a wide variety of new commissions, thematic shows, talks, screenings and pop up events year round.\n\nThe company began trading as Vivid in the late 1990s, but was established as Birmingham Centre for Media Arts in 1992, when TURC Video amalgamated with the community arts organisation Wide Angle. The conjunction of the two entities created a hybrid resource unique in Birmingham: a film, video and photography workshop creating community access to what at the time was the dominant means of visual communications.\n\nPopularly known in the 1990s as BCMA, the centre adopted the name Vivid following a re-location to The Big Peg in Birmingham's jewellery quarter and began several years of digital image making, digital video training and artist development. From 2000 Vivid concentrated on developing contemporary new media and artist moving image through production, commissioning, exhibition and event programmes.\n\nThe organisation moved to its final home, called The Garage - a former motor garage built in the 1950s - from its previous location in the Jewellery Quarter in April 2005. Renovation of the large MOT garage, in order to provide an exhibition and events programme alongside artist production, created a flexible, multi-purpose space for Digbeth - the first in the area. The Garage, occupied and still bore the evidence of its former use as a vehicle repair workshop, including a large area marked \"MOT Bay\".\n\nAfter failing to win Arts Council funding Vivid closed in 2012. Vivid Projects was started soon after by the Vivid curatorial team and is based at Minerva Works in Digbeth.\n"}
