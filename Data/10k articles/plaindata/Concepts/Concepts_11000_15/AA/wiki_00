The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where \"A\" is a closed subspace of \"Y\" one can show that the map \"X\" → \"X\" ∪ \"Y\" is a closed embedding and (\"Y\" − \"A\") → \"X\" ∪ \"Y\" is an open embedding.\n\n\nThe attaching construction is an example of a pushout in the category of topological spaces.

One can form a more general pushout by replacing \"i\" with an arbitrary continuous map \"g\" — the construction is similar.

It may have had help from humans as an introduced species or it may not.\n\nThe term is now used by some writers in a more restricted sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers. In this sense, the cattle egret (\"Bubulcus ibis\"), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the black rat (\"Rattus rattus\"), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the kudzu vine (\"Pueraria lobata\"), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.\n\nThe later and more limited concept is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become naturalized; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive. Cultivated plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in biological control programs eventually become naturalized.\n\nWe can readily see how this second (later) concept applies to cultivated plants. Those that grow within the confines of culture are ‘adventive’; those that grow outside those confines are ‘naturalized’. But the concept falls apart when applied to the far more numerous species of invertebrate animals and microorganisms: extremely few of these are cultured, and by the time they are detected in nature they tend to be established (‘naturalized’).\n\n"}

The precept of \"aparigraha\" is a self-restraint (temperance) from the type of greed and avarice where one's own material gain or happiness comes by hurting, killing or destroying other human beings, life forms or nature.\n\nAparigraha is related to and in part a motivator of dāna (proper charity), both from giver's and receiver's perspective.\n\nAparigraha is a compound in Sanskrit, made of \"\"a-\" and \"parigrah\". The prefix \"a-\"\" means \"non-\", so \"\"aparigrah\" is the opposite of \"parigrah\"\", so \"aparigraha\" is speech and actions that oppose and negate \"parigraha.\"\n\nThe word \"parigrah\" means ‘to amass’, ‘to crave’, ‘to seek’, ‘to seize’, and ‘to receive or accept’ material possessions or gifts from others. The word also includes the idea of doing good with the expectation of benefit or reward, not just for the sake of merely doing good. Parigraha includes the results as well as the intent; in other words, it means the attitudes of craving, possessiveness, and hoarding, but also the things that have been acquired because of those attitudes. The concept of aparigraha as one of the means to liberate the soul from the cycle of birth and death was first laid down by first \"tirthankara\" in Jainism, Rishabhdeva.\n\nMonier-Williams states that the word \"parigraha\" has roots in the Vedic texts as well, referring to fencing an altar, enclosing something, assuming or putting on a dress or receiving something. In the Brahmanas and later texts, the term contextually means accepting or taking a gift, acquiring, possessing, claiming, controlling something such a property, or assistance, or constraining force on others. In some texts, the root reflects the state of marriage or having a family.\n\nThe virtue of aparigraha means taking what is truly necessary and no more. In Yoga school of Hinduism, this concept of virtue has also been translated as \"abstaining from accepting gifts\", \"not expecting, asking, or accepting inappropriate gifts from any person\", and \"not applying for gifts which are not to be accepted\". The concept includes in its scope non-covetousness, and non-possessiveness. Taylor states, aparigraha includes the psychological state of \"letting go and the releasing of control, transgressions, fears\" and living a content life unfettered by anxieties.\n\nAparigraha is one of the virtues in Jainism. It is also one of the five vows that both householders (\"Śrāvaka\") and ascetics must observe. This Jain vow is the principle of limiting one’s possessions (\"parimita-parigraha\") and limiting one’s desires (\"iccha-parimana\").\n\nIn Jainism, worldly wealth accumulation is considered as a potential source of rising greed, jealousy, selfishness and desires. Giving up emotional attachments, sensual pleasures and material possession is a means of liberation, in Jain philosophy. Eating enough to survive is considered more noble than eating for indulgence. Similarly, all consumption is more appropriate if it is essential to one's survival, and inappropriate if it is a form of hoarding, show off or for ego. Non-possession and non-attachment are a form of virtue, and these are recommended particularly in later stages of one's life. After ahiṃsā, Aparigraha is the second most important virtue in Jainism.\n\nIn the Yoga Sūtras (II.30), \"aparigraha\" is listed as the fifth Yamas or code of self-restraint, after with Ahimsa (nonviolence), Satya (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), Asteya (not stealing), and Brahmacharya (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions).\n\nAparigraha is thus one of the five essential restraints (\"yamas\", \"the don'ts\") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (\"niyamas\", \"the dos\") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living. While Yoga Sutras distills the ten \"yamas\" and \"niyamas\", these virtues appear, in various discussions, in Vedic texts. It is part of ethical theory in Hinduism.\n\nJames Wood states, \"aparigraha\" is the virtue of abstaining from appropriating objects because one understands the disadvantages in \"acquiring them, keeping them, losing them, being attached to them, or in harming them\". Patanjali suggests that greed and coveting material wealth increases greed and possessiveness, a cycle that distracts from good reasons for activity that should motivate a person, and ultimately to a state where a person seeks material wealth without effort and by harming, hurting or impoverishing someone else, or some living creature. Yoga Sutra's sutra 2.39 states,\n\nRestraint from possessiveness and greed, or \"aparigraha\", leads one away from harmful and injurious greed, refraining from harming others, and towards the spiritual state of good activity and understanding one's motives and origins. The virtue of non-coveting, non-possessing is a means of Sādhanā, path of spiritual existence. In outer world, \"aparigraha\" manifests as non-possessiveness with simple living; while in psychological terms, it is a state of non-attachment, non-craving and one that envelops the sense of contentment.\n\nSome suggest \"aparigraha\" implies the concepts of charity (dāna) and conservation. Taking and wasting more of nature, or from others, is inconsistent with the ethical precept of aparigraha.\n\nScholars suggest \"aparigraha\" allies with ideas that inspire environmental and ecological sustainability. Aparigraha suggests the reduction of waste and adds a spiritual dimension to preventing destructive consumption of ecosystems and nature.\n\nAsteya is also one of the five vows taken by Jain ascetic monks to attain liberation. It is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else. Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.\n\n"}
{"id": "5354120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5354120", "title": "Apollonian and Dionysian", "text": "Apollonian and Dionysian\n\nThe Apollonian and Dionysian is a philosophical and literary concept, or also a dichotomy, based on Apollo and Dionysus in Greek mythology. Some Western philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative works, most notably Friedrich Nietzsche and later followers. \n\nIn Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both sons of Zeus. Apollo is the god of the sun, of rational thinking and order, and appeals to logic, prudence and purity. Dionysus is the god of wine and dance, of irrationality and chaos, and appeals to emotions and instincts. The Ancient Greeks did not consider the two gods to be opposites or rivals, although often the two deities were entwined by nature.\n\nAlthough the use of the concepts of the Apollonian and Dionysian is linked to Nietzsche's \"The Birth of Tragedy\", the terms were used before him in German culture. The poet Hölderlin spoke of them, while Winckelmann talked of Bacchus, the god of wine. After Nietzsche, others have continued to make use of the distinction. For example, Rudolf Steiner treated in depth the Apollonian and Dionysian and placed them in the general history and spiritual evolution of mankind.\n\nNietzsche's aesthetic usage of the concepts, which was later developed philosophically, first appeared in his book \"The Birth of Tragedy\", which was published in 1872. His major premise here was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian \"Kunsttriebe\" (\"artistic impulses\") form dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Nietzsche is adamant that the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with Euripides that tragedy begins its downfall (\"Untergang\"). Nietzsche objects to Euripides's use of Socratic rationalism (the dialectic) in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of ethics and reason robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian.\n\nTo further the split, Nietzsche diagnoses the Socratic Dialectic as being diseased in the manner that it deals with looking at life. The scholarly dialectic is directly opposed to the concept of the Dionysian because it only seeks to negate life; it uses reason to always deflect, but never to create. Socrates rejects the intrinsic value of the senses and life for \"higher\" ideals. Nietzsche claims in \"The Gay Science\" that when Socrates drinks the hemlock, he sees the hemlock as the cure for life, proclaiming that he has been sick a long time. (Section 340.) In contrast, the Dionysian existence constantly seeks to affirm life. Whether in pain or pleasure, suffering or joy, the intoxicating revelry that Dionysus has for life itself overcomes the Socratic sickness and perpetuates the growth and flourishing of visceral life force—a great Dionysian 'Yes', to a Socratic 'No'. \nThe interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian is apparent, Nietzsche claimed in \"The Birth of Tragedy\", from their use in Greek tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order of his unjust fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. For the audience of such a drama, Nietzsche claimed, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what he called the \"Primordial Unity\", which revives our Dionysian nature—which is almost indescribably pleasurable. However, he later dropped this concept saying it was \"...burdened with all the errors of youth\" (Attempt at Self-Criticism, §2), the overarching theme was a sort of metaphysical solace or connection with the heart of creation.\n\nDifferent from Kant's idea of the sublime, the Dionysian is all-inclusive rather than alienating to the viewer as a sublimating experience. The sublime needs critical distance, while the Dionysian demands a closeness of experience. According to Nietzsche, the critical distance, which separates man from his closest emotions, originates in Apollonian ideals, which in turn separate him from his essential connection with self. The Dionysian embraces the chaotic nature of such experience as all-important; not just on its own, but as it is intimately connected with the Apollonian. The Dionysian magnifies man, but only so far as he realizes that he is one and the same with all ordered human experience. The godlike unity of the Dionysian experience is of utmost importance in viewing the Dionysian as it is related to the Apollonian, because it emphasizes the harmony that can be found within one's chaotic experience.\n\nNietzsche's idea has been interpreted as an expression of \"fragmented consciousness\" or existential instability by a variety of modern and post-modern writers, especially Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. According to Peter Sloterdijk, the Dionysian and the Apollonian form a dialectic; they are contrasting, but Nietzsche does not mean one to be valued more than the other. Truth being \"primordial pain\", our existential being is determined by the Dionysian/Apollonian dialectic.\n\nExtending the use of the Apollonian and Dionysian onto an argument on interaction between the mind and physical environment, Abraham Akkerman has pointed to masculine and feminine features of city form.\n\nAnthropologist Ruth Benedict used the terms to characterize cultures that value restraint and modesty (Apollonian) and ostentatiousness and excess (Dionysian). An example of an Apollonian culture in Benedict's analysis was the Zuñi people as opposed to the Dionysian Kwakiutl people. The theme was developed by Benedict in her main work \"Patterns of Culture\".\n\nAlbert Szent-Györgyi, who wrote that \"a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge\", divided scientists into two categories: the Apollonians and the Dionysians. He called scientific dissenters, who explored \"the fringes of knowledge\", Dionysians. He wrote, \"In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian.\"\n\nAmerican humanities scholar Camille Paglia writes about the Apollonian and Dionysian in her 1990 bestseller \"Sexual Personae\". The broad outline of her concept has roots in Nietzschean discourse, an admitted influence, although Paglia's ideas diverge significantly.\n\nThe Apollonian and Dionysian concepts comprise a dichotomy that serves as the basis of Paglia's theory of art and culture. For Paglia, the Apollonian is light and structured while the Dionysian is dark and chthonic (she prefers \"Chthonic\" to Dionysian throughout the book, arguing that the latter concept has become all but synonymous with hedonism and is inadequate for her purposes, declaring that \"the Dionysian is no picnic.\"). The Chthonic is associated with females, wild/chaotic nature, and unconstrained sex/procreation. In contrast, the Apollonian is associated with males, clarity, celibacy and/or homosexuality, rationality/reason, and solidity, along with the goal of oriented progress: \"Everything great in western civilization comes from struggle against our origins.\"\n\nShe argues that there is a biological basis to the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, writing: \"The quarrel between Apollo and Dionysus is the quarrel between the higher cortex and the older limbic and reptilian brains.\" Moreover, Paglia attributes all the progress of human civilization to masculinity revolting against the Chthonic forces of nature, and turning instead to the Apollonian trait of ordered creation. The Dionysian is a force of chaos and destruction, which is the overpowering and alluring chaotic state of wild nature. Rejection of – or combat with – Chthonianism by socially constructed Apollonian virtues accounts for the historical dominance of men (including asexual and homosexual men; and childless and/or lesbian-leaning women) in science, literature, arts, technology and politics. As an example, Paglia states: \"The male orientation of classical Athens was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny.\"\n\n"}

There is a mural in Texas about her life, displayed in a county park which is named for her.\n\nChristia V. Daniels was born in 1893 in Victoria, Texas and grew up in Edna, Texas, the daughter of Hardy Daniels and Ada Crosby Daniels. Her father had a hauling business, and her mother was a laundress. She had an older, half-sister who had been legally adopted by her mother as well as two younger brothers. Her early life was hevily influenced by her Christian religion, which she professed at 11, and her involvement with the Methodist Church. She attended Samuel Huston College, of which her godfather was a cofounder, and trained to teach at the Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College, graduating in 1915.\n\nChristia Daniels taught at public schools in Edna for three years and then left teaching in 1918 after she married Elbert H. Adair, a brakeman for the Missouri-Pacific Railroad, and moved to Kingsville, Texas. Here, she joined a women's group and fought against gambling establishments and organized petition drives for women's suffrage. Despite the success of the women's suffrage movement, she was prevented from voting in Texas and turned away from a polling place due to state stating that black Americans cannot vote in primaries, even though she was allowed to register to vote. This incident prompted Adair to begin working with the Civil Rights movement. Her work in the community increased when the trends of racial discrimination at the time became more prevalent.\n\nShe moved to Houston in 1925, and joined the city's chapter of the NAACP in 1943. She served the chapter as executive secretary from 1949 or 1950 to 1959, through the period of the landmark Smith v. Allwright case. After the case was decided in the favor of Smith, the Houston chapter of the NAACP became a popular target for bomb threats. She refused to divulge the group's membership rolls to police due to the belief that the Houston police were trying to procure the list in order to break up the chapter, under the guise of claims of barratry. She was one of the chapter members who testified during the trial regarding the attempted seizure of the chapter's records.\n\nAdair worked on desegregation of the Houston Public Library, airport, hospital, and public transit facilities, as well as department store dressing rooms. She was part of the effort to make black Texans eligible to serve on juries, and to be hired for county jobs. Adair co-founded the Harris County Democrats, an integrated organization, and in 1966 was the first African-American woman elected to the state's Democratic Executive Committee (though she refused her seat on the committee in protest). She was also active in the Methodist Episcopal Church from childhood, and was the first woman on the denomination's general board.\n\nAdair was honored during her lifetime, as the namesake of a county park and community center in Houston, which includes a John T. Biggers mural about her life; and in 1984 when she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. She also gave an interview to the Black Women Oral History Project at Harvard's Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, in 1977.\n\nShe was widowed in 1943.

The framework is based on empirical developmental research showing that an individual's perception of reality is an actively constructed \"world of their own\", unique to them and which they continue to develop over their lifespan.\n\nCDF was developed by Otto Laske based on the work of Robert Kegan and Michael Basseches, Laske's teachers at Harvard University. The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage, cognitive level of development, and psychological profile. It provides three epistemological perspectives on individual clients as well as teams. These constructs are designed to probe how an individual and/or group constructs the real world conceptually, and how close an individual's present thinking approaches the complexity of the real world.\n\nThe methodology of CDF is grounded in empirical research on positive adult development which began under Lawrence Kohlberg in the 1960s, continued by Robert Kegan (1982, 1994), Michael Basseches 1984, and Otto Laske (1998, 2006, 2009, 2015, 2018). Laske (1998, 2009) introduced concepts from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy and the Frankfurt School into the framework, making a strict differentiation between social–emotional and cognitive development.\n\nKegan (1982) described five stages of development, of which the latter four are progressively attained only in adulthood. Basseches (1984) showed that adults potentially transcend formal logical thinking by way of dialectical thinking, in four phases, measurable by a fluidity index. Both Kegan's and Basseches' findings were updated and refined by Laske in 2005 and 2008 respectively. In 2008 and 2015, Laske proposed that dialectical thought forms are an instantiation of Bhaskar's \"four moments of dialectic\" (MELD; Bhaskar 1993), and that these ontological moments form a sequence M→E→L→D that underlies individual cognitive development (Laske 2015), providing a basis for a dialectical cognitive science as well as a cognitively oriented management science. Based on the concept of 'dialogical dialectic', Laske stressed the need for a dialogical, in contrast to a monological, social science.The CDF methodology involves three separate instruments that respectively measure a person's social–emotional stage ('what should I do and for whom?'), cognitive level of development ('what can I know and what therefore are my options?'), and psychological profile ('how am I doing right now?'). The first two tools (ED, CD) provide an epistemological, the third (NP) a psychological, perspective on a person or team. See the list of references below.\n\nIn CDF, social-emotional, cognitive, and psychological assessment are arrived at separately, as follows:\n\nIn CDF, each of these profiles by itself is considered a pure abstraction since it is only in their togetherness that the \"hidden dimensions of a person's consciousness\" can be empirically understood and made the basis of an intervention. Importantly, a CDF intervention requires dialectical thinking, in contrast to purely logical thinking as used in positivistic research. For this reason, CDF is a model of dialogical, not monological, research.\n\nAccording to the developmental psychologist Robert Kegan, a person's self-concept evolves in a series of stages through their lifetime. Such evolution is driven alternately by two main motivations: that of being autonomous and that of belonging to a group. Human beings are \"controlled\" by these motivations in the sense that they do not have influence on them but are rather defined by them. Additionally, these motivations are in conflict and their relationship develops over a lifespan.\n\nKegan describes 5 stages of development, of which the latter 4 are progressively attained in adulthood, although only a small proportion of adults reach the fourth stage and beyond:\n\nCDF refers to such stages as \"social–emotional\" in that they relate to the way a person makes meaning of their experience in the social world. CDF holds that people are rarely precisely at a single stage but more accurately are distributed over a range where they are subject to the conflicting influences of a higher and a lower stage.\n\nThe social–emotional profile of person is assessed by means of an interview, referred to as the \"subject–object\" interview. In the interview, the interviewer offers prompts such as \"success\", \"change\", \"control\", \"limits\", \"frustration\", and \"risk\" and invites the interviewee to describe meaningful experiences under those headings. The interviewer serves as a listener, whose role is to focus the attention of the interviewee onto their own thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe interview is scored by identifying excerpts of speech that indicate a particular stage or sub-stage. Relevant sections are chosen from the transcript of the interview and analyzed for indications of the stage of development. The most frequent sub-stage revealed by the scoring is described as the interviewee's \"centre of gravity\". Stages scored at below the center of gravity are described as \"risk\" (of regression) while stages scored above the center of gravity are described as \"potential\" (for development). The distribution of scores is summarized by a \"risk–clarity–potential\" index (RCP) that can be used to characterize the nature of the developmental challenges facing a person.\n\nAccording to Jean Piaget, thinking develops in 4 stages from childhood to young adulthood. Piaget named these stages sensory-motor, pre-operational, concrete-operational, and formal-operational. Development of formal-operational thinking is considered to continue until approximately until the 25th year of life. Subsequent researchers have concentrated on the now famous question of Kohlberg: \"Is there a life after 25?\" In CDF, the development of post formal-operational thinking in an adult is indicated primarily by the strength of dialectical thinking measured in thought form use fluidity.\n\nFollowing Bhaskar (1993), in CDF, human thinking is seen as developing in four sequential phases or 'eras', termed 'common sense', 'understanding', 'reason' and finally 'practical wisdom'. The first three phases of thinking development can be related to the different thinking systems put forward by the philosophers Locke, Kant and Hegel. Each phase includes and transcends the thinking system of the previous phase. The final phase of 'practical wisdom' loops back to a higher form of 'common sense' in that it constitutes sophisticated thinking that has become second nature and is therefore effortless. In contrast to other adult development researchers such as Fischer and Commons, Laske describes post-formal cognitive development in terms of the use and co-ordination of dialectical thought forms and thought form constellations which were described by Basseches as mental schemata.\n\nDialectical thinking has its roots in Greek classical philosophy but is also found in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, and relates to the search for truth through reasoned argument. It finds its foremost expression in the work of the German philosopher Georg Hegel. Essentially, dialectics is viewed as the system by which human thought attempts to capture the nature of reality. Building on Bhaskar and Basseches, CDF uses a framework for dialectical thinking based on the idea that everything in reality is transient and composed of contradictions, part of a larger whole, related in some way to everything else, and subject to sudden transformation. This framework therefore distinguishes dialectical thinking in terms of four classes of dialectical thought forms that can be said to define reality:\n\n\nIn addition, CDF distinguishes seven individual thought forms for every class, making a total of 28 thought forms, representing a re-formulation of Basseches' 24 schematas.\n\nThe cognitive profile describes the thinking tools at a person's disposal and shows the degree to which a person's thinking has developed as indicated by their use of dialectical thought forms in the four classes. The profile is derived by means of a semi-structured interview where the interviewer has the task of eliciting the interviewee's use of thought forms in a conversation about the interviewee's work and workplace. The text of the interview is subsequently analyzed and scored to give a series of mathematical indicators.\n\nAccording to CDF thinking that is highly developed is represented by the following features:\n\n\nSocial–emotional and cognitive development are often seen as separate lines of development but Laske (2008) proposed that they are linked by \"stages of reflective judgment\" or \"epistemic position\", described as the view taken by a person on what constitutes \"knowledge\" and \"truth\". Epistemic position defines a person's ability to deal with uncertainty and insecurity in their knowledge of the world and, together with the stage of social–emotional development, reflects the \"stance\" that a person takes towards the world. Whilst cognitive development provides a person with \"tools\" for thinking consisting of thought forms derived from both logic and dialectics, the \"stance\" that a person takes determines whether they apply the thinking tools at their disposal.\n\nCDF employs the theory put forward by psychologist Henry Murray that much of human behavior is determined by the effort to satisfy certain psychological (or \"psychogenic\" needs), most of which are unconscious. Personality is thus seen as characteristic behavior emerging from the dynamic between a person's pattern of psychogenic needs and the environmental forces acting on that person—termed \"press\".\n\nThe need–press analysis draws on Sigmund Freud's model of the human psyche divided into the components of Id, Ego and Super-ego. In living, a person is subject to the unconscious yearnings of the Id, whilst consciously aspiring to certain ideals imposed by the Super-ego, which itself is influenced by the social context. It is the dynamic balance between the forces of Id and Super-ego and the work environment that determines a person's capacity for work. Imbalances between the social reality of work and a person's ideals lead to frustration, and imbalances between a person's unconscious needs and their ideals lead to a waste of energy or \"energy sink.\"\n\nCDF assessment methodology uses a self-report psychometric questionnaire originated by Henry Murray's student Morris Aderman, called the need–press (NP) inventory.\n\nThe questionnaire assesses psychological characteristics in terms of three categories: \"self-conduct, task focus, and interpersonal perspective,\", each of them defined by 6 variables assessed independently. The questionnaire compares a person's current needs with 1) what they would be like in an ideal (moral) world and 2) what they perceive they are offered in actuality (such as a specific cultural environment they are in tune or at odds with). Each category is composed of several categories (scales) such as: need for control, drive to achieve, affiliation etc. Comparisons and interpretation can be made between a person's scores for \"Need\", and their scores for ideal and actual \"Press\". Comparisons can also be made between a person's scores and those of the group of people with whom they are working. Finally, NP scores can be linked to developmental scores (ED & CD), whether of an individual or team.\n\nThe assessment methodology employed by CDF was created to measure peoples' capability and capacity for work. The theory of work used by CDF is derived from the work of Elliott Jaques. According to Jaques, work is defined as the application of reflective judgment in order to pursue certain goals within certain time limits. This definition stresses the importance of how decisions are made in a complex world and the time-span within which decisions are carried out. While Jaques offers a strictly cognitive definition of work, CDF views the social–emotional aspects of work as equally important, also including the person's (manager's, CEO's) NP profile.\n\nCDF distinguishes between two kinds of work capability, applied and potential. Applied capability refers to the resources that an individual can already apply in order to carry out work. Potential capability refers to the resources that an individual may be capable of applying in the future. An individual can decide at any time not to apply their potential work capability. Equally circumstances may impede a person from applying their potential capability. Work capability is therefore not the same as the capacity to deliver work but rather defines and limits it.\n\nIn CDF work capacity is measured in terms of the need–press personality profile, whilst applied capability is measured in terms of the thinking tools shown up by the cognitive profile, and potential capability is measured in terms of the risk–clarity–potential score taken from the social–emotional profile.\n\nFor Elliot Jaques, human organizations are structured managerially according to levels of accountability. Each level of accountability entails a higher level of complexity in the work required of the role-holder, termed \"size of role\". Jaques defined the notion of requisite organization, where roles in an organization are hierarchically organized at specific levels of increasing complexity.\n\nThe application of CDF as an assessment methodology to measure the \"size of person\" in terms of their work capability and capacity provides a way forward for talent management systems to match the \"size of person\" to the \"size of role\". Progressively more complex roles require progressively higher levels of social–emotional development and cognitive development in the role-holder. In this way requisite organizations can align their human capability architecture with their managerial accountability architecture and design \"growth assignments\" that facilitate the development of capability for more complex roles.\n\nCDF provides a platform for professional coaching such as in leadership development and management development in a variety of ways. Firstly it provides assessment tools from which the coach can construct an integrated model of the coachee complete with the developmental challenges of the client who is to be helped. Secondly, and in the sense used by Edgar Schein the use of the assessment tools and the feedback of results by the coach is an act of \"process consultation\" by which the client may come to understand better the assumptions, values, attitudes and behaviors that are helping or hindering their success. Thirdly, CDF provides tools for deeper and more sophisticated thinking, thereby enabling the client to explore and expand their conceptual landscape of a problem.\n\nCDF distinguishes between behavioral and developmental coaching. The goal of behavioral coaching is to improve the client's actual performance at work, described in CDF terms as their applied capability. In contrast, the goal of developmental coaching is to illuminate and develop the client's current and emergent capabilities for work in the context of their cognitive and social–emotional development.\n\nAs shown in the book \"Dynamic Collaboration: Strengthening Self Organization and Collaborative Intelligence in Teams\", by Jan De Visch and Otto Laske (2018), CDF can be a tool for building in organizations a \"dialogical culture\" by which distributed leadership in organizations can be realized.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18938636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18938636", "title": "Decompiler", "text": "Decompiler\n\nA decompiler is a computer program that takes an executable file as input, and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is therefore the opposite of a compiler, which takes a source file and makes an executable. Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce obfuscated code. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in the reverse engineering of computer software.\n\nThe term \"decompiler\" is most commonly applied to a program which translates executable programs (the output from a compiler) into source code in a (relatively) high level language which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program. By comparison, a disassembler translates an executable program into assembly language (and an assembler could be used to assemble it back into an executable program).\n\nDecompilation is the act of using a decompiler, although the term can also refer to the output of a decompiler. It can be used for the recovery of lost source code, and is also useful in some cases for computer security, interoperability and error correction. The success of decompilation depends on the amount of information present in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the analysis performed on it. The bytecode formats used by many virtual machines (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime) often include extensive metadata and high-level features that make decompilation quite feasible. The presence of debug data can make it possible to reproduce the original variable and structure names and even the line numbers. Machine language without such metadata or debug data is much harder to decompile.\n\nSome compilers and post-compilation tools produce obfuscated code (that is, they attempt to produce output that is very difficult to decompile). This is done to make it more difficult to reverse engineer the executable.\n\nDecompilers can be thought of as composed of a series of phases each of which contributes specific aspects of the overall decompilation process.\n\nThe first decompilation phase loads and parses the input machine code or intermediate language program's binary file format. It should be able to discover basic facts about the input program, such as the architecture (Pentium, PowerPC, etc.) and the entry point. In many cases, it should be able to find the equivalent of the codice_1 function of a C program, which is the start of the user written code. This excludes the runtime initialization code, which should not be decompiled if possible. If available the symbol tables and debug data are also loaded. The front end may be able to identify the libraries used even if they are linked with the code, this will provide library interfaces. If it can determine the compiler or compilers used it may provide useful information in identifying code idioms.\n\nThe next logical phase is the disassembly of machine code instructions into a machine independent intermediate representation (IR). For example, the Pentium machine instruction\n\nmight be translated to the IR\n\nIdiomatic machine code sequences are sequences of code whose combined semantics is not immediately apparent from the instructions' individual semantics. Either as part of the disassembly phase, or as part of later analyses, these idiomatic sequences need to be translated into known equivalent IR. For example, the x86 assembly code:\n\ncould be translated to\n\nSome idiomatic sequences are machine independent; some involve only one instruction. For example, clears the codice_2 register (sets it to zero). This can be implemented with a machine independent simplification rule, such as codice_3.\n\nIn general, it is best to delay detection of idiomatic sequences if possible, to later stages that are less affected by instruction ordering. For example, the instruction scheduling phase of a compiler may insert other instructions into an idiomatic sequence, or change the ordering of instructions in the sequence. A pattern matching process in the disassembly phase would probably not recognize the altered pattern. Later phases group instruction expressions into more complex expressions, and modify them into a canonical (standardized) form, making it more likely that even the altered idiom will match a higher level pattern later in the decompilation.\n\nIt is particularly important to recognize the compiler idioms for subroutine calls, exception handling, and switch statements. Some languages also have extensive support for strings or long integers.\n\nVarious program analyses can be applied to the IR. In particular, expression propagation combines the semantics of several instructions into more complex expressions. For example,\n\ncould result in the following IR after expression propagation:\nThe resulting expression is more like high level language, and has also eliminated the use of the machine register codice_2 . Later analyses may eliminate the codice_5 register.\n\nThe places where register contents are defined and used must be traced using data flow analysis. The same analysis can be applied to locations that are used for temporaries and local data. A different name can then be formed for each such connected set of value definitions and uses. It is possible that the same local variable location was used for more than one variable in different parts of the original program. Even worse it is possible for the data flow analysis to identify a path whereby a value may flow between two such uses even though it would never actually happen or matter in reality. This may in bad cases lead to needing to define a location as a union of types. The decompiler may allow the user to explicitly break such unnatural dependencies which will lead to clearer code. This of course means a variable is potentially used without being initialized and so indicates a problem in the original program.\n\nA good machine code decompiler will perform type analysis. Here, the way registers or memory locations are used result in constraints on the possible type of the location. For example, an codice_6 instruction implies that the operand is an integer; programs do not use such an operation on floating point values (except in special library code) or on pointers. An codice_7 instruction results in three constraints, since the operands may be both integer, or one integer and one pointer (with integer and pointer results respectively; the third constraint comes from the ordering of the two operands when the types are different).\n\nVarious high level expressions can be recognized which trigger recognition of structures or arrays. However, it is difficult to distinguish many of the possibilities, because of the freedom that machine code or even some high level languages such as C allow with casts and pointer arithmetic.\n\nThe example from the previous section could result in the following high level code:\nThe penultimate decompilation phase involves structuring of the IR into higher level constructs such as codice_8 loops and codice_9 conditional statements. For example, the machine code\n\ncould be translated into:\n\nUnstructured code is more difficult to translate into structured code than already structured code. Solutions include replicating some code, or adding boolean variables.\n\nThe final phase is the generation of the high level code in the back end of the decompiler. Just as a compiler may have several back ends for generating machine code for different architectures, a decompiler may have several back ends for generating high level code in different high level languages.\n\nJust before code generation, it may be desirable to allow an interactive editing of the IR, perhaps using some form of graphical user interface. This would allow the user to enter comments, and non-generic variable and function names. However, these are almost as easily entered in a post decompilation edit. The user may want to change structural aspects, such as converting a codice_8 loop to a codice_11 loop. These are less readily modified with a simple text editor, although source code refactoring tools may assist with this process. The user may need to enter information that failed to be identified during the type analysis phase, e.g. modifying a memory expression to an array or structure expression. Finally, incorrect IR may need to be corrected, or changes made to cause the output code to be more readable.\n\nThe majority of computer programs are covered by copyright laws. Although the precise scope of what is covered by copyright differs from region to region, copyright law generally provides the author (the programmer(s) or employer) with a collection of exclusive rights to the program. These rights include the right to make copies, including copies made into the computer's RAM (unless creating such a copy is essential for using the program).\nSince the decompilation process involves making multiple such copies, it is generally prohibited without the authorization of the copyright holder. However, because decompilation is often a necessary step in achieving software interoperability, copyright laws in both the United States and Europe permit decompilation to a limited extent.\n\nIn the United States, the copyright fair use defense has been successfully invoked in decompilation cases. For example, in \"Sega v. Accolade\", the court held that Accolade could lawfully engage in decompilation in order to circumvent the software locking mechanism used by Sega's game consoles. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (PUBLIC LAW 105–304) has proper exemptions for both Security Testing and Evaluation in §1205(i), and Reverse Engineering in §1205(f).\n\nIn Europe, the 1991 Software Directive explicitly provides for a right to decompile in order to achieve interoperability. The result of a heated debate between, on the one side, software protectionists, and, on the other, academics as well as independent software developers, Article 6 permits decompilation only if a number of conditions are met:\n\n\nIn addition, Article 6 prescribes that the information obtained through decompilation may not be used for other purposes and that it may not be given to others.\n\nOverall, the decompilation right provided by Article 6 codifies what is claimed to be common practice in the software industry. Few European lawsuits are known to have emerged from the decompilation right. This could be interpreted as meaning one of three things: 1) the decompilation right is not used frequently and the decompilation right may therefore have been unnecessary, 2) the decompilation right functions well and provides sufficient legal certainty not to give rise to legal disputes or 3) illegal decompilation goes largely undetected. In a recent report regarding implementation of the Software Directive by the European member states, the European Commission seems to support the second interpretation.\n\n\n"}

Common reactions to dysphoria include emotional distress; in some cases, even physical distress. The opposite state of mind is known as euphoria.\n\nIntense states of distress and unease increase the risk of suicide, as well as being unpleasant in themselves.

The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of Great Britain and Tasmania) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology.

{"id": "1009410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1009410", "title": "Geographical segregation", "text": "Geographical segregation\n\nGeographical segregation exists whenever the proportions of population rates of two or more populations are not homogenous throughout a defined space. Populations can be considered any plant or animal species, human genders, followers of a certain religion, people of different nationalities, ethnic groups, etc.\n\nIn social geography segregation of ethnic groups, social classes and genders is often measured by the calculation of indices such as the index of dissimilarity. Different dimensions of segregation (or its contrary) are recognised: exposure, evenness, clustering, concentration, centralisation, etc. More recent studies also highlight new local indices of segregation.\n\nSegregation, as a broad concept, has appeared in all parts of the world where people exist—in different contexts and times it takes on different forms, shaped by the physical and human environments. The spatial concentration of population groups is not a new phenomenon. Since societies began to form there have been segregated inhabitants. Either segregated purposefully by force, or gradually over time, segregation was based on socio-economic, religious, educational, linguistic or ethnic grounds. Some groups choose to be segregated to strengthen social identity.\n\nSegregation can be caused by legal frameworks, such as in the extreme example of apartheid in South Africa, and even Jewish ghettoization in Germany in the 20th century. Segregation can also happen slowly, stimulated by increased land and housing prices in certain neighborhoods, resulting in segregation of rich and poor in many urban cities. Segregation can also be assigned arbitrarily. This can occur on a global scale, such as is seen in the Partition of India, instances in Ireland, and many other situations. Geographical boundaries were often put in place without much consideration for native peoples and natural geographic terrain and cultural limits that had long been in place.\n\nIn apartheid South Africa, segregation was very much a legal concept. Enforced by the government, Africans were discriminated against, and forced to comply with apartheid. Some of the legislation passed dealt with physical segregation in schools, land tenure, geographic segregation and state repression. These were very clearly legislative, but also in the case of most white South Africans, a social construct as well.\n\nSegregation can also be encouraged, using geographical boundaries, while not explicitly enforced. Public housing projects, especially in the United States, have been criticized for this. Putting cheap housing in poor black neighborhoods encouraged local African-Americans to stay in the area, keeping other richer areas white by not building public housing there. This has been changing in the last ten years.\n\nSegregation can also be caused by social factors that become evident as they happen, but are not necessarily government sanctioned. This could be things like informal ghettos, or simply rich neighborhoods. In terms of land capital, over time in a given area, humans will settle down and buy or take land. Some privileged people will acquire better land (that is, more arable, proximate to potential capital, more pleasing views). Demand for these nicer habitats drives up prices, and areas deemed “better” based solely on geography become inherently exclusionary in their population makeup.\n\nWest Point Grey, an area of Vancouver Canada, is in part rich because of the views offered of Downtown Vancouver, the Gulf Islands, and its location near the water and University of British Columbia. Wealthy people had the resources to pay for advantages, and subsequently drove up prices. Examples of this can be seen all over the world. Geographical segregation is not defined by the sightline of places, though. It also occurs around certain structures, or simply in areas that are specifically developed with an income bracket in mind.\n\nAnother segregation term, the ghetto, has been used in many different contexts over time, generally meaning any physical part of a city predominantly occupied by any particular group of people. It implies that the group may be looked down upon and segregated purposefully. This does not mean that all ghettos are built up communities and buildings specifically for a segregation purpose, although many are. In the case of the United States, segregation of the African-American community was to a degree due to white flight out of the cities, than forcing African-Americans to live in the downtown cores.\n\nGated communities could be seen as a combination of both legal frameworks and social conventions regarding segregation. A gated community today is a controlled neighborhood, inhabited by people with common interests, such as safety, or class separation, but not necessarily of the same ethnicity or religion—it is distinct from an international community (in most cases). Gated communities are very controversial, as they can be seen as encouraging distinction and separation, and therefore superiority from those who do not live with the gates community.\n\nVoluntary segregation is almost as common an occurrence as involuntary segregation is. Often, immigrants coming to a new and foreign country will band together for mutual benefit, and to keep a sense of community in the new country. These can be called ethnic enclaves and can be formed by any community or people group. Some well-known groups are Chinatowns, Little Italys and \"barrios\". These localized phenomena also come in the form of ethnoburbs, which are essentially the same concept as an ethnic enclave, but specifically located in suburbs, rather than the traditional downtowns, where Chinatowns and Little Italys are usually based.\n\n"}

In a landmark judgment in the English-speaking Caribbean, Justice Devindra Rampersad ruled the clauses unconstitutional and null and void. (See also: LGBT rights in Trinidad and Tobago.)\n\nBorn in Port of Spain, Jones was an altar boy and sang in the choir at St Patrick's RC Church while attending Newtown Boys' RC primary school. He later attended Fatima College. He was the grandson of the St Patrick's organist Ivy Telfer. His mother was Monica Jones, a British journalist, and his father, Mervyn Telfer, a television broadcaster on the national TV station Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT). Monica later married Rex Lassalle, one of the leaders of a Regiment mutiny on April 21, 1970 (\"see Black Power Revolution\"). Jones was bullied as a child because \"it was obvious to others\" he was gay. He said in a newspaper interview that his parents \"outed\" him: “One day they sat me down and had a talk with me because there was so much homophobic bullying happening to me and I didn’t even know what a \"bullerman\" [a homophobic slur in Trinidad] was. They sat me down and explained what it meant. They didn’t avoid the pink elephant in the room.” Jones was a singer and left Trinidad in the 1985 to pursue his singing career in the UK.\n\nJones returned to Trinidad and Tobago in 1992 and 1996 but \"was forced away again\" to the UK to avoid \"persecution\" and \"homophobia\". He received death threats in Trinidad for his activism. In 2010 and 2014 he returned to Trinidad and Tobago but returned to the UK again in the face of \"intolerable\" homophobia. He filed the historic lawsuit in the High Court of Trinidad and Tobago on February 23, 2017, challenging the constitutionality of Sections 13 and 16 in the Sexual Offences Act on the basis that: the “very existence of these sections continuously and directly affects the claimant’s private life by forcing him to either respect the law and refrain from engaging – even in private with consenting male partners – in prohibited sexual acts to which he is disposed by reason of his homosexual orientation, or to commit the prohibited acts and thereby become liable to criminal prosecution”. The lawsuit claimed the legislation infringed on his rights to privacy and freedom of thought and expression, and contravened his human rights. He further claimed those sections of the Act opened him up to ridicule and persecution because they criminalized consensual adult homosexual acts. \n\nJones was represented by Richard Drabble QC, Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel; and the State by Fyard Hosein, SC, Keisha Prosper and Lesley Almarales.\n\nThe court heard arguments in January 2018 and delivered its judgment on April 12, 2018. \n\nIn his judgement Justice Devindra Rampersad said Jones had proved the State's retention of the pertinent sections had “everything to do with homosexuality and the colonial abhorrence to the practice.” “It is a threat that is sanctioned by the State and that sanction is an important sanction because it justifies in the mind of others in society who are differently minded that the very lifestyle, life and existence of a person who chooses to live, in the way that the claimant does, is criminal and is deemed of a lesser value than anyone else. Those criminal sanctions have the potential to be used oppressively by differently minded citizens as a foundation for hate as condoned by the State,” the judgement said.\n\nRampersad said of LGBTQI+ people in his judgment: “That is not their identity. That is not their soul. That is not the sum total of their value to society or their value to themselves. The experiences of apartheid South African and the USA during and after slavery, even into the mid- and late 20th century, have shown the depths that human dignity has been plunged as a result of presupposed and predetermined prejudices based on factors that do not accept or recognise humanity. Racial segregation, apartheid, the Holocaust – these are all painful memories of this type of prejudice.”\n\nThe law cannot simply be struck from the books because of the Savings Provision of the Trinidad and Tobago Constitution, which retains laws that were in force before the Constitution was enacted in 1976. What Trinidadians and Tobagonians call the \"Buggery Law\" was inherited from the British legal code. However, since the original law was amended twice to raise penalties against homosexual sex acts, Jones argued the savings clause is not relevant.\n\nThe Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi, has since promised to appeal the ruling. \n\nJones uses social media to raise funds for his legal campaign. His Instagram, Twitter and Facebook) accounts often feature posts on his campaign for LGBTQI+ rights in Trinidad and Tobago. \n"}

The hope was that this would start a chain of kind acts that could be publicly tracked by their unique code on an interactive online platform.\n\nIn March 2010, the company furthered its efforts to inspire unexpected acts of kindness with \"Do the KIND Thing\", a platform that empowered people to turn kind acts into support for causes. During the platform's three-month duration, \"Do The KIND Thing\" inspired more than 40,000 acts of kindness in support of nearly 150 causes. At the culmination, KIND awarded funds to the three causes that inspired the greatest number of KIND acts: Operation Gratitude Good Girls Give and Suffolk County JCC\n\nIn March 2011, KIND unveiled a new iteration of \"Do the KIND Thing\" where people could transform their small acts of kindness into big KIND Acts that give back to the world.\n\nOn the first Tuesday of each month, KIND challenges its community to carry out a specific KINDING Mission (KIND Tuesday). If enough people sign up to complete that month's KINDING Mission, KIND carries out a BIG KIND Act for a group of people that really needs it.\n\nThe #kindawesome card is a method noted on the Kind bar website. When someone does something nice, a #kindawesome card can be sent to them that can be redeemed for a free kind bar.

{"id": "3007610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3007610", "title": "Kingdom of Ends", "text": "Kingdom of Ends\n\nThe Kingdom of Ends () is a thought experiment centered on the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant introduced the concept in his \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\" (4:439). The thought experiment proposes a world in which all human beings are treated as ends (meaning treated as if they and their well-being are the goal), not as mere means to an end for other people.\n\nThe Kingdom of Ends is a hypothetical state of existence that is derived from Kant's categorical imperative. A Kingdom of Ends is composed entirely of rational beings, whom Kant defines as those capable of moral deliberation (though his definition expands in other areas) who must choose to act by laws that imply an absolute necessity. It is from this point of view that they must judge themselves and their actions.\n\nThough the term is usually translated as \"Kingdom of Ends\", the German word \"Reich\" is perhaps more appropriately translated as \"realm\". Kant uses it to mean the \"systematic union of different rational beings under common laws\". These common laws, established by the categorical imperative, are the gauge used to evaluate the worthiness of an individual's actions. When all the kingdom's individuals live by the categorical imperative—particularly Kant's second formulation of it—each one will treat all of his fellowmen as ends in themselves, instead of means to achieving one's own selfish goals. This systematic whole is the Kingdom of Ends.\n\nPeople can only belong to the Kingdom of Ends when they become subject to these universal laws. Such rational beings must regard themselves simultaneously as sovereign when making laws, and as subject when obeying them. Morality, therefore, is acting out of reverence for all universal laws which make the Kingdom of Ends possible. In a true Kingdom of Ends, acting virtuously will be rewarded with happiness.\n\nIn his writings on religion, Kant interprets the Kingdom of God as a religious symbol for the moral reality of the Kingdom of Ends. As such, it is the ultimate goal of both religious and political organization of human society.\n\nUtopia\n"}

After World War II it was alleged that Nazis had made lampshades from murdered concentration camp inmates. In the 1950s, murderer Ed Gein, possibly influenced by the stories about the Nazis, made a lampshade from the skin of one of his victims.\n\nThe display of the flayed skin of defeated enemies has a long history. In ancient Assyria, the flaying of defeated enemies and dissidents was common practice. The Assyrians would leave the skin to tan on their city walls.\n\nThere have been several claims that the binding of some ancient and medieval books may be made of human skin. Allegedly, a 13th-century bible and a text of the Decretals were bound in human skin. Along with this hearsay, there are reports of copies of the 1793 French Constitution being written on human skin and 19th-century anatomy textbooks being symbolically bound in skin.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany, claims circulated that Ilse Koch, wife of the commandant of Buchenwald concentration camp, had possessed lampshades made of human skin, and had specifically tattooed prisoners killed in order to use their skin for this purpose. After her conviction for war crimes, General Lucius D. Clay, the interim military governor of the American Zone in Germany, reduced her sentence to four years' prison on the grounds \"there was no convincing evidence that she had selected Nazi concentration camp inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin\".\n\nJean Edward Smith in his biography, \"Lucius D. Clay, an American Life\", reported that the general had maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of goat skin. The book quotes a statement made by General Clay years later:\n\nThe charges were made once more when she was rearrested, but again were found to be groundless. Journalist Mark Jacobson claims to be in possession of this lampshade, but those claims are disputed.\n\nEd Gein was a killer and body snatcher, active in the 1950s, who made trophies from corpses he stole from a local graveyard. When he was finally arrested, a search of the premises revealed, among other disturbing artifacts, a lampshade made out of human skin. Gein appears to have been influenced by the then-current stories about the Nazis collecting body parts in order to make lampshades and other items.\n\nIn a 1970 episode of the first series of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" sketch \"Mr. Hitler and the Minehead by-election\", Adolf Hitler (played by John Cleese) says, \"If he opens his big mouth again ... it's lampshade time!\"\n\nIn the 1973 London Weekend Television drama \"The Death of Adolf Hitler\", Doctor Karl Gebhardt (played by Ray McAnally) claims to Hitler (Frank Finlay) that the lampshade in his office in the Führerbunker is made of human skin. Hitler is disgusted and flies into a rage, violently throwing the lamp away, showing Hitler's cognitive dissonance between his personal morality and the twisted inhumanity of his orders.\n\nIn 1995, August Kreis III was ejected from the set of \"The Jerry Springer Show\" after telling the host \"Your relatives – weren't they all turned into soap or lampshades?... I've got your mom in the trunk of my car\".\n\nThe song \"Skinned\" from the 1995 Blind Melon album \"Soup\" is about Ed Gein and contains the lyrics \"I'll make a lampshade of durable skin.\"\n\nA human lampshade appears in Ken Russell's 2007 short satire \"A Kitten for Hitler\". In the film, Lenny, an American Jewish boy, who has a swastika-shaped birthmark, tries to soften Hitler's heart by giving him a kitten, but when Hitler sees the birthmark, he has Eva Braun kill Lenny to make him into a lampshade for their bedside table lamp. Near the end of the film, in what appears to be an act of God, the swastika transforms into the Star of David.\n\nIn 2010 author Mark Jacobson published \"\". In it he described how after Hurricane Katrina he uncovered a lamp which he believed to be made of human skin, and which may have come from a Nazi concentration camp. Initial flawed DNA testing appeared to show this was the case, but later more sophisticated testing proved it was cow skin.\n\nIn 2012, a human-skin lamp appeared in the \"I Am Anne Frank\" episode of \"\".\n"}
{"id": "47025476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47025476", "title": "Lea Lublin", "text": "Lea Lublin\n\nLea Lublin (born 1929, Brest, Poland, died in 1999, Paris, France) was an Argentine-French performance artist. Her involvement with feminist movements and themes included the WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution in Los Angeles in 2007.\n\nLea Lublin emigrated with her family to Argentina in 1931 and grew up in Buenos Aires. There she attended classes at the from age 12 on and graduated in 1949. Lublin began her artist life as painter, but in mid-1960 after her move to Paris, she began her interest in exploration of new media and materials. This interest lead her to cooperation with Centro de Artes Visuales of the Institute Torquato di Tella, an Argentinean center for experimental and avant-garde art.\n\nLublin's work investigates imagery, often searching for what may not have yet been seen within imagery that is otherwise familiar. Her work has been influenced by psychoanalysis and feminist thought.\n\nLublin activated her works, often encouraging the viewer to interact with the work. For example, she mounted glass over painted reproductions of famous, iconographic paintings such as the Mona Lisa and installed windshield wipers onto the glass. The audience was invited to squirt water on the painting, which would be cleared again by the wipers.\n\nLarge-scale Installation art works followed. Lublin immersed viewers into the work, using made-to-specs inflatable tubes and objects, as well as black light and dark rooms or heaps of tiny plastic balls in which audience members could sit and cover themselves.\n\nLublin also created performance art sometimes called \"exhibition-performances.\" In \"Mon fils\" (1968), she participated in the respectable May Exhibition in Paris by taking her baby son to the museums during the regular exhibition hours and exhibiting him and herself by doing the normal care of changing diapers, breast feeding and putting her son to sleep in his bed that she had brought with them. This brought public attention to social and gender roles in her work. She continued performances of this kind in Argentina and Chile until the end of the 1960s. Her next work the \"Terranauts\" (1969) was deeply influenced by French feminism. Lublin eventually moved permanently to Paris, where she worked and lived until her death in 1999.\n\nIn her work, Lublin left behind the flat canvas that she had used as painter and became part of the movement of the 1960s that used art as a means for involved active social dialogue. Lublin supported the division on art and the life, building on Borges' belief that art is a form of breathing. And her stand in it was feminist, involving the audience, critical but open for different receiver's groups.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Lublin tended to present her work in public rather than inside museums. She asked questions to passers by originally regarding art and later about the role of the women. Lublin also put provocative questions on large cloths, hoisted like flags to attract attention. By setting up closed circuit TV cameras nearby, she gave contributors the air of speaking as pundits on TV, breaking with role expectations and their own personal experience.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s and until her last works in the mid 1990s, Lublin returned to interacting with iconographic works, particularly Renaissance paintings. She deconstructed the imagery of these paintings by, for example, removing the child from different paintings of Madonna with the child. This work explored the role of the baby and his mother in paintings created by male painters. Following psychoanalytical patterns, she identified the painter with the child looking for an eroticized image of the mother in the works or otherwise revealing sexual undertones in Christian imagery.\n\nWhen Lublin briefly returned to her former home Buenos Aires in 1989, she investigated Marcel Duchamp's stay in the city from 1918 to 1919. Lublin got access to Duchamp's former apartment and noticed that both the old windows and the still mostly original colors of some walls matched those of Duchamp's iconic 1920 work \"Fresh Widow\" which he made after returning to Paris. Lublin also discovered that the female alter ego Duchamp used after 1920, Rose Sélavy, matched advertising in a Buenos Aires newspaper that he was known to have read. When she left, she stole the dilapidated letter box from Duchamp's former apartment and exhibited it later, recalling his Readymade works. Lublin's interactions with Duchamp continued when she deconstructed the Rose advertising as well as his famous pissoirs in several of her own works, shifting them into a dispute with feminist statements. One of these was titled \"Le corps amer (à mère), l'objet perdu de M.D.\", shown at \"Femininmasculin\" at Beauborg in Paris. This piece consisted of a large, transparent skirt, stomach, and breasts with a urinal inside.\n\nLublin is considered to be part of the same generation as artists Lygia Clark and Allan Kaprow.\n\nHer works are in the collections of Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Centre national des arts plastiques, the Fonds régional d’art contemporain Alsace, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n\nThe vast majority of the existing works are in her estate, administrated by Nicolas Lublin in Paris. In 2015 the Lenbachhaus, in Munich, Germany hosts the first ever retrospective, drawing heavily on the estate and works from several museum collections.\n\n"}

Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.\n\nWhat resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.\n\nIn addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21583", "title": "Nationality", "text": "Nationality\n\nNationality is a legal relationship between an individual person and a state. Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. What these rights and duties are varies from state to state.\n\nBy custom and international conventions, it is the right of each state to determine who its nationals are. Such determinations are part of nationality law. In some cases, determinations of nationality are also governed by public international law—for example, by treaties on statelessness and the European Convention on Nationality.\n\nNationality differs technically and legally from citizenship, which is a different legal relationship between a person and a country. The noun \"national\" can include both citizens and non-citizens. The most common distinguishing feature of citizenship is that citizens have the right to participate in the political life of the state, such as by voting or standing for election. However, in most modern countries all nationals are citizens of the state, and full citizens are always nationals of the state.\n\nIn older texts, the word \"nationality\" rather than \"ethnicity\", often used to refer to an ethnic group (a group of people who share a common ethnic identity, language, culture, descent, history, and so forth). This older meaning of \"nationality\" is not defined by political borders or passport ownership and includes nations that lack an independent state (such as the Arameans, Scots, Welsh, English, Basques, Catalans, Kurds, Kabyles, Baloch, Berbers, Bosniaks, Kashmiris,\nPalestinians, Sindhi, Tamils, Hmong, Inuit, Copts, Māori, Sikhs, Wakhi and Székelys).\n\nIndividuals may also be considered nationals of groups with autonomous status that have ceded some power to a larger government.\n\nIn international law, nationality is the status or relationship that gives a nation the right to protect a person from other nations. Diplomatic and consular protection are dependent upon this relationship between the person and the state. A person's status as being the national of a country is used to resolve the conflict of laws.\n\nNationality is also the status that allows a nation to grant rights to the subject and to impose obligations upon the subject. In most cases, no rights or obligations are automatically attached to this status, although the status is a necessary precondition for any rights and obligations created by the state.\n\nWithin the broad limits imposed by few treaties and international law, states may freely define who their nationals are and are not. However, since the \"Nottebohm\" case, other states are only required to respect their claim to protect an alleged national if the nationality is based on a true social bond. In the case of dual nationality, states may determine the most effective nationality for a person, to determine which state's laws are most relevant. There are also limits on removing a person's status as a national. Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"Everyone has the right to a nationality,\" and \"No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.\"\n\nNationals normally have the right to enter or return to the country they belong to. Passports are issued to nationals of a state, rather than only to citizens, because the passport is the travel document used to enter the country. However, nationals may not have the right of abode (the right to live permanently) in the countries that grant them passports.\n\nConceptually, citizenship is focused on the internal political life of the state and nationality is a matter of international dealings.\n\nIn the modern era, the concept of full citizenship encompasses not only active political rights, but full civil rights and social rights. Nationality is a necessary but not sufficient condition to exercise full political rights within a state or other polity. Nationality is required for full citizenship, and some people have no nationality in international law. A person who is denied full citizenship or nationality is commonly called a stateless person.\n\nHistorically, the most significant difference between a national and a citizen is that the citizen has the right to vote for elected officials, and to be elected. This distinction between full citizenship and other, lesser relationships goes back to antiquity. Until the 19th and 20th centuries, it was typical for only a small percentage of people who belonged to a city or state to be full citizens. In the past, most people were excluded from citizenship on the basis of gender, socioeconomic class, ethnicity, religion, and other factors. However, they held a legal relationship with their government akin to the modern concept of nationality.\n\nUnited States nationality law defines some persons born in U.S. outlying possessions as U.S. nationals but not citizens. British nationality law defines six classes of British national, among which \"British citizen\" is one class (having the right of abode in the United Kingdom, along with some \"British subjects\"). Similarly, in the Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, the status of national without household registration applies to people who have Republic of China nationality, but do not have an automatic entitlement to enter or reside in the Taiwan Area, and do not qualify for civic rights and duties there. Under the nationality laws of Mexico, Colombia, and some other Latin American countries, nationals do not become citizens until they turn 18.\n\nNationality is sometimes used simply as an alternative word for ethnicity or national origin, just as some people assume that citizenship and nationality are identical. In some countries, the cognate word for \"nationality\" in local language may be understood as a synonym of ethnicity or as an identifier of cultural and family-based self-determination, rather than on relations with a state or current government. For example, some Kurds say that they have Kurdish nationality, even though there is no Kurdish sovereign state at this time in history.\nIn the context of former Soviet Union and former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, \"nationality\" is often used as translation of the Russian \"nacional'nost' \" and Serbo-Croatian \"narodnost\", which were the terms used in those countries for ethnic groups and local affiliations within the member states of the federation. In the Soviet Union, more than 100 such groups were formally recognized. Membership in these groups was identified on Soviet internal passports, and recorded in censuses in both the USSR and Yugoslavia. In the early years of the Soviet Union's existence, ethnicity was usually determined by the person's native language, and sometimes through religion or cultural factors, such as clothing. Children born after the revolution were categorized according to their parents' recorded ethnicities. Many of these ethnic groups are still recognized by modern Russia and other countries.\n\nSimilarly, the term \"nationalities of China\" refers to ethnic and cultural groups in China. Spain is one nation, made up of nationalities, which are not politically recognized as nations (state), but can be considered smaller nations within the Spanish nation. Spanish law recognises the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Catalonia, Valencia, Galicia and the Basque Country as \"nationalities\" (\"nacionalidades\").\n\nNational identity is a person's subjective sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. A person may be a national of a state, in the sense of being its citizen, without subjectively or emotionally feeling a part of that state, for example many migrants in Europe often identify with their ancestral and/or religious background rather than with the state of which they are citizens. Conversely, a person may feel that he belongs to one state without having any legal relationship to it. For example, children who were brought to the U.S. illegally when quite young and grow up there with little contact with their native country and its culture often have a national identity of feeling American, despite legally being nationals of a different country.\n\nDual nationality is when a single person has a formal relationship with two separate, sovereign states. This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country claims all offspring of the mother's as their own nationals, but the father's country claims all offspring of the father's.\n\nNationality, with its historical origins in allegiance to a sovereign monarch, was seen originally as a permanent, inherent, unchangeable condition, and later, when a change of allegiance was permitted, as a strictly exclusive relationship, so that becoming a national of one state required rejecting the previous state.\n\nDual nationality was considered a problem that caused conflict between states and sometimes imposed mutually exclusive requirements on affected people, such as simultaneously serving in two countries' military forces. Through the middle of the 20th century, many international agreements were focused on reducing the possibility of dual nationality. Since then, many accords recognizing and regulating dual nationality have been formed.\n\nStatelessness is the condition in which an individual has no formal or protective relationship with any state. This might occur, for example, if a person's parents are nationals of separate countries, and the mother's country rejects all offspring of mothers married to foreign fathers, but the father's country rejects all offspring born to foreign mothers. Although this person may have an emotional national identity, he or she may not legally be the national of any state.\n\nAnother stateless situation arises when a person holds a travel document (passport) which recognizes the bearer as having the nationality of a \"state\" which is not internationally recognized, has no entry in the International Organization for Standardization's country list, is not a member of the United Nations, etc. In the current era, persons native to Taiwan who hold Republic of China passports are one example. \nThis list includes parents' ability to confer nationality on their children or to spouses. \n\n\n"}

When budgeting for a new product, NRE must be considered to analyze if a new product will be profitable. Even though a company will pay for NRE on a project only once, NRE costs can be prohibitively high and the product will need to sell well enough to produce a return on the initial investment. NRE is unlike production costs, which must be paid constantly to maintain production of a product. It is a form of fixed cost in economics terms. Once a system is designed any number of units can be manufactured without increasing NRE cost.\n\nIn a project-type (manufacturing) company, large parts (possibly all) of the project represent NRE. In this case the NRE costs are likely to be included in the first project's costs, this can also be called research and development (R&D). If the firm cannot recover these costs, it must consider funding part of these from reserves, possibly take a project loss, in the hope that the investment can be recovered from further profit on future projects.\n\nThe concept of full product NRE as described above may lead readers to believe that NRE expenses are necessarily high. However, Focused NRE wherein small amounts of NRE money can yield large returns by making existing product changes is an option to consider as well. A small adjustment to an existing assembly may be considered, in order to use a less expensive or improved subcomponent or to replace a subcomponent which is no longer available. In the world of embedded firmware, NRE may be invested in code development to fix problems or to add features where the costs to implement are a very small percentages of an immediate return. Chrysler found such a way to repair a transmission problem by investing trivial NRE dollars into computer firmware to fix a mechanical problem to save some tens of millions of dollars in mechanical repairs to transmissions in the field. \n\nMastery of NRE concepts as financial investments are a most excellent loss control tool and must be considered a key part of manufacturing profit enhancement.\n\n"}

Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion.\n\nDespite antecedents dating back to the 1800s and support from diverse fields such as economics, philosophy, political science, history, and law, odious debt is not part of international law; in fact, \"[n]o national or international tribunal has ever cited Odious Debt as grounds for invalidating a sovereign obligation.\" Instead, international law holds governments strictly liable for all debt incurred by their predecessors.\n\nThe concept of odious debt was formalized in a 1927 treatise by Alexander Nahum Sack, a Russian émigré legal theorist. It was based on two 19th-century precedents—Mexico's repudiation of debts incurred by Emperor Maximilian, and the denial by the United States of Cuban liability for debts incurred by the Spanish colonial regime.\n\nSack wrote:\nWhen a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the interests of the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc, this debt is odious for the people of the entire state. This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime. The reason why these odious debts cannot attach to the territory of the state is that they do not fulfil one of the conditions determining the lawfulness of State debts, namely that State debts must be incurred, and the proceeds used, for the needs and in the interests of the State. Odious debts, contracted and utilised for purposes which, to the lenders' knowledge, are contrary to the needs and the interests of the nation, are not binding on the nation – when it succeeds in overthrowing the government that contracted them – unless the debt is within the limits of real advantages that these debts might have afforded. The lenders have committed a hostile act against the people, they cannot expect a nation which has freed itself of a despotic regime to assume these odious debts, which are the personal debts of the ruler.\nSack theorized that such debts are not enforceable when (1) the lender should have known that (2) the debt was incurred without the consent and (3) without benefit to the populace. There are many examples of similar debt repudiation. Chief Justice William Howard Taft, acting as an arbiter, used the doctrine to find that Costa Rica did not have to pay the United Kingdom debts incurred by the Federico Tinoco Granados regime.\n\nPatricia Adams, executive director of Probe International, a Canadian environmental and public policy advocacy organization and author of \"Odious Debts: Loose Lending, Corruption, and the Third World's Environmental Legacy\", stated: \"by giving creditors an incentive to lend only for purposes that are transparent and of public benefit, future tyrants will lose their ability to finance their armies, and thus the war on terror and the cause of world peace will be better served.\" In a Cato Institute policy analysis, Adams suggested that debts incurred by Iraq during Saddam Hussein's reign were odious because the money was spent on weapons, instruments of repression, and palaces.\n\nA 2002 article by economists Seema Jayachandran and Michael Kremer renewed interest in this topic. They propose that the idea can be used to create a new type of economic sanction to block further borrowing by dictators. Jayachandran proposed new recommendations in November 2010 at the 10th anniversary of the Jubilee movement at the Center for Global Development in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the loan sanctions model has been adapted by the Centre for Global Developments and has been the base for a number of further suggestions. Some think the doctrine could aid international development. Others think that the doctrine should allow even more kinds of debt to be canceled.\n\nIn December 2008, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa attempted to default on Ecuador's national debt, calling it illegitimate odious debt, because it was contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes. He succeeded in reducing the price of the debt letters before continuing paying the debt.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Haiti's Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986, there were calls to cancel Haiti's debt owed to multilateral institutions, calling it unjust odious debt, and Haiti could better use the funds for education, health care, and basic infrastructure. As of February 2008, the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution had 66 co-sponsors in the U.S. House of Representatives. Several organizations in the United States issued action alerts around the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution, and a Congressional letter to the U.S. Treasury, including Jubilee USA, the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti and Pax Christi USA.\n\n"}

{"id": "24743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24743", "title": "Pessimism", "text": "Pessimism\n\nPessimism is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is \"Is the glass half empty or half full?\"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an optimist is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.\n\nPhilosophical pessimism is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often existential nihilists believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.\n\nThe term pessimism derives from the Latin word \"pessimus\" meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by Jesuit critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel 'Candide, ou l'Optimisme'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of Leibniz who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the \"Revue de Trévoux\" accused him of \"pessimisme\".\n\nPhilosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a worldview or ethic that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the Idea of Progress and religious faith) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the Dialogue of Pessimism and Ecclesiastes (which maintains that everything is \"hevel\", literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean 'senseless' and 'absurd'.)\n\nIn Western philosophy, philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other. In \"Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit\", Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as \"that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense ironic; that freedom and happiness are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd.\"\n\nPhilosophical pessimists see the self-consciousness of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this \"terror\" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.\n\nThe philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can \"progress\" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse. This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, \"our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection\".\n\nThe pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense \"absurd\". Absurdity is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: \"a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting\". The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to Socrates and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.\n\nThe responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as Schopenhauer and Mainländer, recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in Indian religions and Christian monasticism). Some followers tend to believe that \"expecting the worst leads to the best.\" Rene Descartes even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to \"negative\" events were removed. Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace nothingness. Others like Nietzsche, Leopardi, Julius Bahnsen and Camus respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a \"Dionysian pessimism\", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: Suicide, a leap of faith (as per Kierkegaard's knight of faith), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.\n\nPhilosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers (Wagner, Brahms and Mahler). Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is aphoristic writing, and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include Miguel de Cervantes, Lord Byron, Charles Baudelaire, Gottfried Benn, Sadegh Hedayat, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Joseph Conrad, Charles Bukowski, Thomas Mann, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Mihai Eminescu, Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Cormac McCarthy, Samuel Beckett, Dino Buzzati, Jorge Luis Borges, H. P. Lovecraft, Michel Houellebecq, Thomas Ligotti, Thomas Bernhard and Camilo Pessanha.\n\nIn \"Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks\", Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the pre-Socratic philosophers such as Anaximander, Heraclitus (called \"the Weeping Philosopher\") and Parmenides represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the \"enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist\". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:\nHeraclitus denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable \"indefinite.\" And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: \"I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before.\" \"The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52\" \nAnother Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient Cyrenaic philosopher Hegesias (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.\nComplete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.\nHegesias held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: \"for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference\". According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called \"Death by Starvation\", which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, Ptolemy II Philadelphus banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.\n\nFrom the 3rd century BCE, Stoicism propounded as an exercise \"the premeditation of evils\"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.\n\nBaltasar Gracián (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel \"El Criticón\" was his favorite book. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's \"The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence\" into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style (conceptismo) and often quoted him in his works. Gracian's novel \"El Criticón\" (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for happiness which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. \"The Critic\" paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His \"Pocket Oracle\" was a book of aphorisms on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.\n\nVoltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist due to his critique of Alexander Pope's optimistic \"An Essay on Man\", and Leibniz' affirmation that \"we live in the best of all possible worlds.\" Voltaire's novel Candide is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his Poem on the Lisbon Disaster is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a Deist, Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the problem of evil.\n\nThe major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called \"the patriarch of pessimism\". For Rousseau, humans in their \"natural goodness\" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the state of nature as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by \"amour propre\", a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives \"always outside himself\", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of \"perfectibility\" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').\n\nRousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus \"The Social Contract\" opens with the famous phrase \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\" Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are \"greater slaves\" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live \"outside themselves\".\n\nThough a lesser known figure outside Italy, Giacomo Leopardi was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that \"Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives.\" Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that \"it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing.\"\n\nLeopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of Christopher Columbus who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully. Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: \"He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die.\"\n\nArthur Schopenhauer's pessimism comes from his elevating of Will above reason as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The Will is the ultimate metaphysical animating noumenon and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one metaphor, Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will. Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. \nHe pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and sexuality as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.\n\nAll satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — \"The world as will and representation, pg 319\" \n\nSchopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging \"like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents\". This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (\"nichtigkeit\") and to realize that \"the purpose of our existence is not to be happy\".\n\nMoreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.\n\nSchopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through \"losing yourself\" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of asceticism (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by \"saintly persons\") could free oneself from the Will altogether.\n\nSchopenhauer never used the term \"pessimism\" to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that. Other common terms used to describe his thought were voluntarism and irrationalism which he also never used.\n\nDuring the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, post-Schopenhauerian pessimism became a rather popular \"trend\" in 19th century Germany. Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as Hegelianism, materialism, Neo-Kantianism and the emerging positivism. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in science, the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as Julius Bahnsen, Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, Philipp Mainländer and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's transcendental idealism into what Frederick C. Beiser calls transcendental realism. The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not things-in-themselves), the transcendental realist thesis is that \"the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves.\"\n\nBy espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the \"Post-Schopenhauerian\" thinkers inherited from the Frankfurt sage's teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would \"assuage\" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing historicism, as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor Julius Frauenstadt and with Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist). Julius Bahnsen would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall, while Philipp Mainländer set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a \"pessimism of the future\", a \"Dionysian pessimism.\" Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek pre-socratics and also saw it at the core of ancient Greek tragedy. He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw Socratic philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as \"morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse\". Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and nihilism. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a \"great liberation\" through a \"pessimism of strength\" which \"does not sit in judgement of this condition\". Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to \"make oneself a new pair of wings\", i.e. to re-evaluate all values and create new ones. A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of amor fati and eternal recurrence). Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is \"good for one's health\" as a \"remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life\".\n\nIn a 1945 article, Albert Camus wrote \"the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea.\" Camus helped popularize the idea of \"the absurd\", a key term in his famous essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which \"sets me in opposition to all creation\". For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through \"eluding\" (\"l'esquive\"), a 'trickery' for \"those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it\". He considered suicide and religion as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for \"there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.\" Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of Sisyphus, who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\n\nThere are several theories of epistemology which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to nihilism, philosophical skepticism and relativism.\n\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi (1743–1819), analyzed rationalism, and in particular Immanuel Kant's \"critical\" philosophy in order to carry out a reductio ad absurdum according to which all rationalism reduces to nihilism, and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of faith and revelation.\n\nRichard Rorty, Michel Foucault, and Ludwig Wittgenstein questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective social relations of power, or language-games that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of anti-foundationalism, while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.\n\nPhilosophical pessimism stands opposed to the optimism or even utopianism of Hegelian philosophies. Emil Cioran claimed \"Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?\" Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action. This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of social progress can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, \"every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history\". Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an \"idolatry of tomorrow\" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in The Rebel.\n\nThere is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of cultural criticism and social decline which is seen in Oswald Spengler's 'The Decline of the West'. Spengler promoted a cyclic model of history similar to the theories of Giambattista Vico. Spengler believed modern western civilization was in the 'winter' age of decline (\"untergang\"). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in Weimar Germany. Similarly, traditionalist Julius Evola thought that the world was in the Kali Yuga, a dark age of moral decline.\n\nIntellectuals like Oliver James correlate economic progress with economic inequality, the stimulation of artificial needs, and affluenza. Anti-consumerists identify rising trends of conspicuous consumption and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like Jean Baudrillard have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.\n\nConservative thinkers, especially social conservatives, often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. William F. Buckley famously remarked that he was \"standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'\" and Whittaker Chambers was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to communism, though he was himself violently anti-communist. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in Christianity and/or Greek philosophy, leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. Robert Bork's \"Slouching Toward Gomorrah\" and Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind\" are famous expressions of this point of view.\n\nMany economic conservatives and libertarians believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it. They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the welfare state. Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in dystopian novels such as George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to emigrate.\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2007–08 in the United States, the neologism \"pessimism porn\" was coined to describe the alleged eschatological and survivalist thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.\n\nTechnological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the industrial revolution with the Luddite movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The Romantic movement was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like William Wordsworth and William Blake believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.\n\nSome social critics and environmentalists believe that globalization, overpopulation and the economic practices of modern capitalist states over-stress the planet's ecological equilibrium. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, climate change will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and ecological collapse. James Lovelock believes that the ecology of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate. Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:\n\nThe presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.\n\nSome radical environmentalists, anti-globalization activists, and Neo-luddites can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern \"progress\". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is anarcho-primitivism which faults the agricultural revolution with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote deindustrialization, abandonment of modern technology and rewilding.\n\nAn infamous anarcho-primitivist is Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, \"Industrial Society and Its Future\" he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern \"industrial-technological system\". The manifesto begins thus: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.\n\nOne of the most radical pessimist organizations is the voluntary human extinction movement which argues for the extinction of the human race through antinatalism.\n\nPope Francis' controversial 2015 encyclical on ecological issues is ripe with pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world.\n\n'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on thermodynamic principles. According to the first law of thermodynamics, matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the second law of thermodynamics — also known as the entropy law — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the heat death of the universe, taken as a whole.\n\nThe term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and the paradigm founder of ecological economics. Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on \"The Entropy Law and the Economic Process\". Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism. \n\nAmong other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when mankind will ultimately face extinction. In effect, \"any\" conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point. \n\nEntropy pessimism is a widespread view in ecological economics and in the degrowth movement.\n\nBibas writes that some criminal defense attorneys prefer to err on the side of pessimism: \"Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser.\"\n\nIn the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with melancholy, and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. \nThe study of pessimism has parallels with the study of depression. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional pain or even biology. Aaron Beck argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world. Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in Depressive realism or (pessimistic realism). Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding. The pessimism item on the Beck Depression Inventory has been judged useful in predicting suicides. The Beck Hopelessness Scale has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.\n\nWender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: \"If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources.\"\n\nThrough history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration. Al-Ghazali and William James rejected their pessimism after suffering psychological, or even psychosomatic illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term \"pessimism\" is being abused. The link between pessimism and nihilism is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to optimism, nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist Nouriel Roubini was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. \"Personality Plus\" opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. melancholy and phlegmatic) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. choleric and sanguine) miss.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "989011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=989011", "title": "Population pyramid", "text": "Population pyramid\n\nA population pyramid, also called an \"age-sex pyramid\", is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population (typically that of a country or region of the world), which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured by raw number or as a percentage of the total population. This tool can be used to visualize and age of a particular population. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species.\n\nPopulation pyramids often contain continuous stacked-histogram bars, making it a horizontal bar diagram. The population size is depicted on the x-axis (horizontal) while the age-groups are represented on the y-axis (vertical). The size of the population can either be measured as a percentage of the total population or by raw number. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right. Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent. A great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid, and this can shed light on the extent of development and other aspects of the population.\n\nThe measures of central tendency, mean, median, and mode, should be considered when assessing a population pyramid. since the data is not completely accurate. For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur.\n\nA population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low fertility rate. The broad base of the pyramid means the majority of population lies between ages 0–14, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population sub-replacement fertility level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter life expectancy of sixty years. However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\" women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' \"Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,\" considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age-dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The dependency ratio refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15–64). According to Weeks' \"Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues,\" population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. Population momentum, when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term doubling time, which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the age stratification since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population.\n\nIn the demographic transition model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone. In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two.\n\nEach country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, most population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.\n\n\n\n\nGary Fuller (1995) described Youth bulge as a type of expansive pyramid. Gunnar Heinsohn (2003) argues that an excess in especially young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest, war and terrorism, as the \"third and fourth sons\" that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology.\n\nHeinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment) and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge, including European colonialism, 20th-century fascism, rise of Communism during the Cold War, and ongoing conflicts such as that in Darfur and terrorism. This factor has been also used to account for the Arab Spring events. Economic recessions, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Late 2000's recession, are also claimed to be explained in part due to a large youth population who cannot find jobs. Youth bulge can be seen as one factor among many in explaining social unrest and uprisings in society. A 2016 study finds that youth bulges increases the chances of non-ethnic civil wars, but not ethnic civil wars.\n\nA large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough – in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16–30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males. In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability. For Cincotta and Doces (2011), the transition to more mature age structures is almost a sine qua non for democratization.\n\nTo reverse the effects of youth bulges, specific policies such as creating more jobs, improving family planning programs, and reducing over all infant mortality rates should be a priority.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa are currently experiencing a prominent youth bulge. \"Across the Middle East, countries have experienced a pronounced increase in the size of their youth populations over recent decades, both in total numbers and as a percentage of the total population. Today, the nearly 111 million individuals aging between 15 to 29 living across the region make up nearly 27 percent of the region’s population.\" Structural changes in service provision, especially health care, beginning in the 1960s created the conditions for a demographic explosion, which has resulted in a population consisting primarily of younger people. It is estimated that around 65% of the regional population is under the age of 30.\n\nThe Middle East has invested more in education, including religious education, than most other regions such that education is available to most children. However, that education has not led to higher levels of employment, and youth unemployment is currently at 25%, the highest of any single region. Of this 25%, over half are first time entrants into the job market.\n\nThe youth bulge in the Middle East and North Africa has been favorably compared to that of East Asia, which harnessed this human capital and saw huge economic growth in recent decades. The youth bulge has been referred to by the Middle East Youth Initiative as a demographic gift, which, if engaged, could fuel regional economic growth and development. \"While the growth of the youth population imposes supply pressures on education systems and labor markets, it also means that a growing share of the overall population is made up of those considered to be of working age; and thus not dependent on the economic activity of others. In turn, this declining dependency ratio can have a positive impact on overall economic growth, creating a demographic dividend. The ability of a particular economy to harness this dividend, however, is dependent on its ability to ensure the deployment of this growing working-age population towards productive economic activity, and to create the jobs necessary for the growing labor force.\" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "15282871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15282871", "title": "Predicate functor logic", "text": "Predicate functor logic\n\nIn mathematical logic, predicate functor logic (PFL) is one of several ways to express first-order logic (also known as predicate logic) by purely algebraic means, i.e., without quantified variables. PFL employs a small number of algebraic devices called predicate functors (or predicate modifiers) that operate on terms to yield terms. PFL is mostly the invention of the logician and philosopher Willard Quine.\n\nThe source for this section, as well as for much of this entry, is Quine (1976). Quine proposed PFL as a way of algebraizing first-order logic in a manner analogous to how Boolean algebra algebraizes propositional logic. He designed PFL to have exactly the expressive power of first-order logic with identity. Hence the metamathematics of PFL are exactly those of first-order logic with no interpreted predicate letters: both logics are sound, complete, and undecidable. Most work Quine published on logic and mathematics in the last 30 years of his life touched on PFL in some way.\n\nQuine took \"functor\" from the writings of his friend Rudolf Carnap, the first to employ it in philosophy and mathematical logic, and defined it as follows:\n\n\"The word \"functor\", grammatical in import but logical in habitat... is a sign that attaches to one or more expressions of given grammatical kind(s) to produce an expression of a given grammatical kind.\" (Quine 1982: 129)\nWays other than PFL to algebraize first-order logic include:\nPFL is arguably the simplest of these formalisms, yet also the one about which the least has been written.\n\nQuine had a lifelong fascination with combinatory logic, attested to by his (1976) and his introduction to the translation in Van Heijenoort (1967) of the paper by the Russian logician Moses Schönfinkel founding combinatory logic. When Quine began working on PFL in earnest, in 1959, combinatory logic was commonly deemed a failure for the following reasons:\n\nThe PFL syntax, primitives, and axioms described in this section are largely Kuhn's (1983). The semantics of the functors are Quine's (1982). The rest of this entry incorporates some terminology from Bacon (1985).\n\nAn \"atomic term\" is an upper case Latin letter, \"I\" and \"S\" excepted, followed by a numerical superscript called its \"degree\", or by concatenated lower case variables, collectively known as an \"argument list\". The degree of a term conveys the same information as the number of variables following a predicate letter. An atomic term of degree 0 denotes a Boolean variable or a truth value. The degree of \"I\" is invariably 2 and so is not indicated.\n\nThe \"combinatory\" (the word is Quine's) predicate functors, all monadic and peculiar to PFL, are Inv, inv, ∃, +, and p. A term is either an atomic term, or constructed by the following recursive rule. If τ is a term, then Invτ, invτ, ∃τ, +τ, and pτ are terms. A functor with a superscript \"n\", \"n\" a natural number > 1, denotes \"n\" consecutive applications (iterations) of that functor.\n\nA formula is either a term or defined by the recursive rule: if α and β are formulas, then αβ and ~(α) are likewise formulas. Hence \"~\" is another monadic functor, and concatenation is the sole dyadic predicate functor. Quine called these functors \"alethic.\" The natural interpretation of \"~\" is negation; that of concatenation is any connective that, when combined with negation, forms a functionally complete set of connectives. Quine's preferred functionally complete set was conjunction and negation. Thus concatenated terms are taken as conjoined. The notation + is Bacon's (1985); all other notation is Quine's (1976; 1982). The alethic part of PFL is identical to the \"Boolean term schemata\" of Quine (1982).\n\nAs is well known, the two alethic functors could be replaced by a single dyadic functor with the following syntax and semantics: if α and β are formulas, then (αβ) is a formula whose semantics are \"not (α and/or β)\" (see NAND and NOR).\n\nQuine set out neither axiomatization nor proof procedure for PFL. The following axiomatization of PFL, one of two proposed in Kuhn (1983), is concise and easy to describe, but makes extensive use of free variables and so does not do full justice to the spirit of PFL. Kuhn gives another axiomatization dispensing with free variables, but that is harder to describe and that makes extensive use of defined functors. Kuhn proved both of his PFL axiomatizations sound and complete.\n\nThis section is built around the primitive predicate functors and a few defined ones. The alethic functors can be axiomatized by any set of axioms for sentential logic whose primitives are negation and one of ∧ or ∨. Equivalently, all tautologies of sentential logic can be taken as axioms.\n\nQuine's (1982) semantics for each predicate functor are stated below in terms of abstraction (set builder notation), followed by either the relevant axiom from Kuhn (1983), or a definition from Quine (1976). The notation formula_1 denotes the set of n-tuples satisfying the atomic formula formula_2\n\nIdentity is reflexive (\"Ixx\"), symmetric (\"Ixy\"→\"Iyx\"), transitive ( (\"Ixy\"∧\"Iyz\") → \"Ixz\"), and obeys the substitution property:\n\n\"Cropping\" enables two useful defined functors:\nS generalizes the notion of reflexivity to all terms of any finite degree greater than 2. N.B: S should not be confused with the primitive combinator S of combinatory logic.\nHere only, Quine adopted an infix notation, because this infix notation for Cartesian product is very well established in mathematics. Cartesian product allows restating conjunction as follows:\nReorder the concatenated argument list so as to shift a pair of duplicate variables to the far left, then invoke S to eliminate the duplication. Repeating this as many times as required results in an argument list of length max(\"m\",\"n\").\n\nThe next three functors enable reordering argument lists at will. \nGiven an argument list consisting of \"n\" variables, p implicitly treats the last \"n\"-1 variables like a bicycle chain, with each variable constituting a link in the chain. One application of p advances the chain by one link. \"k\" consecutive applications of p to \"F\" moves the \"k\"+1 variable to the second argument position in \"F\".\n\nWhen \"n\"=2, Inv and inv merely interchange \"x\" and \"x\". When \"n\"=1, they have no effect. Hence p has no effect when \"n\"<3.\n\nKuhn (1983) takes \"Major inversion\" and \"Minor inversion\" as primitive. The notation p in Kuhn corresponds to inv; he has no analog to \"Permutation\" and hence has no axioms for it. If, following Quine (1976), p is taken as primitive, Inv and inv can be defined as nontrivial combinations of +, ∃, and iterated p.\n\nThe following table summarizes how the functors affect the degrees of their arguments.\n\nAll instances of a predicate letter may be replaced by another predicate letter of the same degree, without affecting validity. The rules are:\n\nInstead of axiomatizing PFL, Quine (1976) proposed the following conjectures as candidate axioms.\n\n\"n\"-1 consecutive iterations of p restores the \"status quo ante\":\n+ and ∃ annihilate each other:\n\n\nNegation distributes over +, ∃, and p:\n\n\n\n+ and p distributes over conjunction:\n\n\nIdentity has the interesting implication:\n\nQuine also conjectured the rule: If formula_34 is a PFL theorem, then so are formula_35 formula_36 and formula_37.\n\nBacon (1985) takes the conditional, negation, \"Identity\", \"Padding\", and \"Major\" and \"Minor inversion\" as primitive, and \"Cropping\" as defined. Employing terminology and notation differing somewhat from the above, Bacon (1985) sets out two formulations of PFL:\n\nBacon also:\n\nThe following algorithm is adapted from Quine (1976: 300-2). Given a closed formula of first-order logic, first do the following:\n\nNow apply the following algorithm to the preceding result:\n\n1. Translate the matrices of the most deeply nested quantifiers into disjunctive normal form, consisting of disjuncts of conjuncts of terms, negating atomic terms as required. The resulting subformula contains only negation, conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantification.\n\n2. Distribute the existential quantifiers over the disjuncts in the matrix using the rule of passage (Quine 1982: 119):\n\n3. Replace conjunction by Cartesian product, by invoking the fact:\n\n4. Concatenate the argument lists of all atomic terms, and move the concatenated list to the far right of the subformula.\n\n5. Use Inv and inv to move all instances of the quantified variable (call it \"y\") to the left of the argument list.\n\n6. Invoke S as many times as required to eliminate all but the last instance of \"y\". Eliminate \"y\" by prefixing the subformula with one instance of ∃.\n\n7. Repeat (1)-(6) until all quantified variables have been eliminated. Eliminate any disjunctions falling within the scope of a quantifier by invoking the equivalence:\n\nThe reverse translation, from PFL to first-order logic, is discussed in Quine (1976: 302-4).\n\nThe canonical foundation of mathematics is axiomatic set theory, with a background logic consisting of first-order logic with identity, with a universe of discourse consisting entirely of sets. There is a single predicate letter of degree 2, interpreted as set membership. The PFL translation of the canonical axiomatic set theory ZFC is not difficult, as no ZFC axiom requires more than 6 quantified variables.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "201718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201718", "title": "Principle of maximum entropy", "text": "Principle of maximum entropy\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information).\n\nAnother way of stating this: Take precisely stated prior data or testable information about a probability distribution function. Consider the set of all trial probability distributions that would encode the prior data. According to this principle, the distribution with maximal information entropy is the best choice.\n\nThe principle was first expounded by E. T. Jaynes in two papers in 1957 where he emphasized a natural correspondence between statistical mechanics and information theory. In particular, Jaynes offered a new and very general rationale why the Gibbsian method of statistical mechanics works. He argued that the entropy of statistical mechanics and the information entropy of information theory are basically the same thing. Consequently, statistical mechanics should be seen just as a particular application of a general tool of logical inference and information theory.\n\nIn most practical cases, the stated prior data or testable information is given by a set of conserved quantities (average values of some moment functions), associated with the probability distribution in question. This is the way the maximum entropy principle is most often used in statistical thermodynamics. Another possibility is to prescribe some symmetries of the probability distribution. The equivalence between conserved quantities and corresponding symmetry groups implies a similar equivalence for these two ways of specifying the testable information in the maximum entropy method.\n\nThe maximum entropy principle is also needed to guarantee the uniqueness and consistency of probability assignments obtained by different methods, statistical mechanics and logical inference in particular.\n\nThe maximum entropy principle makes explicit our freedom in using different forms of prior data. As a special case, a uniform prior probability density (Laplace's principle of indifference, sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason), may be adopted. Thus, the maximum entropy principle is not merely an alternative way to view the usual methods of inference of classical statistics, but represents a significant conceptual generalization of those methods.\n\nHowever these statements do not imply that thermodynamical systems need not be shown to be ergodic to justify treatment as a statistical ensemble.\n\nIn ordinary language, the principle of maximum entropy can be said to express a claim of epistemic modesty, or of maximum ignorance. The selected distribution is the one that makes the least claim to being informed beyond the stated prior data, that is to say the one that admits the most ignorance beyond the stated prior data.\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy is useful explicitly only when applied to \"testable information\". Testable information is a statement about a probability distribution whose truth or falsity is well-defined. For example, the statements\n\nand\n\n(where \"p\" + \"p\" are probabilities of events) are statements of testable information.\n\nGiven testable information, the maximum entropy procedure consists of seeking the probability distribution which maximizes information entropy, subject to the constraints of the information. This constrained optimization problem is typically solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\nEntropy maximization with no testable information respects the universal \"constraint\" that the sum of the probabilities is one. Under this constraint, the maximum entropy discrete probability distribution is the uniform distribution,\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy is commonly applied in two ways to inferential problems:\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy is often used to obtain prior probability distributions for Bayesian inference. Jaynes was a strong advocate of this approach, claiming the maximum entropy distribution represented the least informative distribution.\nA large amount of literature is now dedicated to the elicitation of maximum entropy priors and links with channel coding.\n\nMaximum entropy is a sufficient updating rule for radical probabilism. Richard Jeffrey's probability kinematics is a special case of maximum entropy inference. However, maximum entropy is not a generalisation of all such sufficient updating rules.\n\nAlternatively, the principle is often invoked for model specification: in this case the observed data itself is assumed to be the testable information. Such models are widely used in natural language processing. An example of such a model is logistic regression, which corresponds to the maximum entropy classifier for independent observations.\n\nOne of the main applications of the maximum entropy principle is in discrete and continuous density estimation.\nSimilar to support vector machine estimators, \nthe maximum entropy principle may require the solution to a quadratic programming and thus provide \na sparse mixture model as the optimal density estimator. One important advantage of the method is able to incorporate prior information in the density estimation.\n\nWe have some testable information \"I\" about a quantity \"x\" taking values in {\"x\", \"x\"..., \"x\"}. We assume this information has the form of \"m\" constraints on the expectations of the functions \"f\"; that is, we require our probability distribution to satisfy the moment inequality/equality constraints:\n\nFurthermore, the probabilities must sum to one, giving the constraint\n\nThe probability distribution with maximum information entropy subject to these equality constraints is:\n\nIt is sometimes called the Gibbs distribution. The normalization constant is determined by:\n\nand is conventionally called the partition function. (The Pitman–Koopman theorem states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a sampling distribution to admit sufficient statistics of bounded dimension is that it have the general form of a maximum entropy distribution.)\n\nThe λ parameters are Lagrange multipliers. In the case of equality constraints their values are determined from the solution of the nonlinear equations\n\nIn the case of inequality constraints, the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a convex optimization program with linear constraints. \nIn both cases, there is no closed form solution, and the computation of the Lagrange multipliers usually requires numerical methods.\n\nFor continuous distributions, the Shannon entropy cannot be used, as it is only defined for discrete probability spaces. Instead Edwin Jaynes (1963, 1968, 2003) gave the following formula, which is closely related to the relative entropy (see also differential entropy).\n\nwhere \"m\"(\"x\"), which Jaynes called the \"invariant measure\", is proportional to the limiting density of discrete points. For now, we shall assume that \"m\" is known; we will discuss it further after the solution equations are given.\n\nA closely related quantity, the relative entropy, is usually defined as the Kullback–Leibler divergence of \"m\" from \"p\" (although it is sometimes, confusingly, defined as the negative of this). The inference principle of minimizing this, due to Kullback, is known as the Principle of Minimum Discrimination Information.\n\nWe have some testable information \"I\" about a quantity \"x\" which takes values in some interval of the real numbers (all integrals below are over this interval). We assume this information has the form of \"m\" constraints on the expectations of the functions \"f\", i.e. we require our probability density function to satisfy the inequality (or purely equality) moment constraints:\n\nAnd of course, the probability density must integrate to one, giving the constraint\n\nThe probability density function with maximum \"H\" subject to these constraints is: \n\nwith the partition function determined by\n\nAs in the discrete case, in the case where all moment constraints are equalities, the values of the formula_12 parameters are determined by the system of nonlinear equations:\n\nIn the case with inequality moment constraints the Lagrange multipliers are determined from the solution of a convex optimization program. \n\nThe invariant measure function \"m\"(\"x\") can be best understood by supposing that \"x\" is known to take values only in the bounded interval (\"a\", \"b\"), and that no other information is given. Then the maximum entropy probability density function is\n\nwhere \"A\" is a normalization constant. The invariant measure function is actually the prior density function encoding 'lack of relevant information'. It cannot be determined by the principle of maximum entropy, and must be determined by some other logical method, such as the principle of transformation groups or marginalization theory.\n\nFor several examples of maximum entropy distributions, see the article on maximum entropy probability distributions.\n\nProponents of the principle of maximum entropy justify its use in assigning probabilities in several ways, including the following two arguments. These arguments take the use of Bayesian probability as given, and are thus subject to the same postulates.\n\nConsider a discrete probability distribution among \"m\" mutually exclusive propositions. The most informative distribution would occur when one of the propositions was known to be true. In that case, the information entropy would be equal to zero. The least informative distribution would occur when there is no reason to favor any one of the propositions over the others. In that case, the only reasonable probability distribution would be uniform, and then the information entropy would be equal to its maximum possible value, log \"m\". The information entropy can therefore be seen as a numerical measure which describes how uninformative a particular probability distribution is, ranging from zero (completely informative) to log \"m\" (completely uninformative).\n\nBy choosing to use the distribution with the maximum entropy allowed by our information, the argument goes, we are choosing the most uninformative distribution possible. To choose a distribution with lower entropy would be to assume information we do not possess. Thus the maximum entropy distribution is the only reasonable distribution.\n\nThe following argument is the result of a suggestion made by Graham Wallis to E. T. Jaynes in 1962. It is essentially the same mathematical argument used for the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics in statistical mechanics, although the conceptual emphasis is quite different. It has the advantage of being strictly combinatorial in nature, making no reference to information entropy as a measure of 'uncertainty', 'uninformativeness', or any other imprecisely defined concept. The information entropy function is not assumed \"a priori\", but rather is found in the course of the argument; and the argument leads naturally to the procedure of maximizing the information entropy, rather than treating it in some other way.\n\nSuppose an individual wishes to make a probability assignment among \"m\" mutually exclusive propositions. She has some testable information, but is not sure how to go about including this information in her probability assessment. She therefore conceives of the following random experiment. She will distribute \"N\" quanta of probability (each worth 1/\"N\") at random among the \"m\" possibilities. (One might imagine that she will throw \"N\" balls into \"m\" buckets while blindfolded. In order to be as fair as possible, each throw is to be independent of any other, and every bucket is to be the same size.) Once the experiment is done, she will check if the probability assignment thus obtained is consistent with her information. (For this step to be successful, the information must be a constraint given by an open set in the space of probability measures). If it is inconsistent, she will reject it and try again. If it is consistent, her assessment will be\n\nwhere \"p\" is the probability of the \"i\" proposition, while \"n\" is the number of quanta that were assigned to the \"i\" proposition (i.e. the number of balls that ended up in bucket \"i\").\n\nNow, in order to reduce the 'graininess' of the probability assignment, it will be necessary to use quite a large number of quanta of probability. Rather than actually carry out, and possibly have to repeat, the rather long random experiment, the protagonist decides to simply calculate and use the most probable result. The probability of any particular result is the multinomial distribution,\n\nwhere\n\nis sometimes known as the multiplicity of the outcome.\n\nThe most probable result is the one which maximizes the multiplicity \"W\". Rather than maximizing \"W\" directly, the protagonist could equivalently maximize any monotonic increasing function of \"W\". She decides to maximize\n\nAt this point, in order to simplify the expression, the protagonist takes the limit as formula_19, i.e. as the probability levels go from grainy discrete values to smooth continuous values. Using Stirling's approximation, she finds\n\nAll that remains for the protagonist to do is to maximize entropy under the constraints of her testable information. She has found that the maximum entropy distribution is the most probable of all \"fair\" random distributions, in the limit as the probability levels go from discrete to continuous.\n\nGiffin and Caticha (2007) state that Bayes' theorem and the principle of maximum entropy are completely compatible and can be seen as special cases of the \"method of maximum relative entropy\". They state that this method reproduces every aspect of orthodox Bayesian inference methods. In addition this new method opens the door to tackling problems that could not be addressed by either the maximal entropy principle or orthodox Bayesian methods individually. Moreover, recent contributions (Lazar 2003, and Schennach 2005) show that frequentist relative-entropy-based inference approaches (such as empirical likelihood and exponentially tilted empirical likelihood – see e.g. Owen 2001 and Kitamura 2006) can be combined with prior information to perform Bayesian posterior analysis.\n\nJaynes stated Bayes' theorem was a way to calculate a probability, while maximum entropy was a way to assign a prior probability distribution.\n\nIt is however, possible in concept to solve for a posterior distribution directly from a stated prior distribution using the principle of minimum cross entropy (or the Principle of Maximum Entropy being a special case of using a uniform distribution as the given prior), independently of any Bayesian considerations by treating the problem formally as a constrained optimisation problem, the Entropy functional being the objective function. For the case of given average values as testable information (averaged over the sought after probability distribution), the sought after distribution is formally the Gibbs (or Boltzmann) distribution the parameters of which must be solved for in order to achieve minimum cross entropy and satisfy the given testable information.\n\nThe principle of maximum entropy bears a relation to a key assumption of kinetic theory of gases known as molecular chaos or \"Stosszahlansatz\". This asserts that the distribution function characterizing particles entering a collision can be factorized. Though this statement can be understood as a strictly physical hypothesis, it can also be interpreted as a heuristic hypothesis regarding the most probable configuration of particles before colliding .\n\n\n\n"}

One model for such a forum is a wiki model where the public may submit the prior art and commentary that are relevant to a given patent application, and patent examiners can consult that forum. The intended effect is that patent examination will be more efficient and thorough so that the patents that are issued will be of a higher quality than is currently possible.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, patent examination in France for novelty and utility was performed by the private French Academy under commission from the French government. The Academy sought the input of outside experts in the specific fields of the inventions. Galileo, for example, was consulted when a patent was applied for regarding a new method of determining longitude according to the position of the moon. Galileo’s conclusion is that the method would work in principle, but the measuring techniques are not accurate enough to provide meaningful results; therefore, the patent was denied.\n\nIn the United States, the third parties may not provide commentary or opinions directly to a patent examiner during the prosecution of a patent unless the patent applicant gives the examiner written permission to do so. Rule 99, which previously allowed a member of the public to submit prior art to an examiner within two months of an application publication, has been repealed by the AIA. Rules 290 (37 CFR 1.290) and 35 USC 122(e) control the submission of prior-art references by third parties after the publication of an application and before the issuance of the patent. The cited prior-art references must be dated at least six months from the date of the publication, the first rejection of any claim, or the notice of allowance.\n\nThe European Patent Convention (EPC) provides that any person may present observations concerning the patentability of an invention described in a European patent application. This is a form of public participation to patent examination. Filing such observations by third parties at the European Patent Office (EPO) is free of charge, but the observations must include a statement of grounds. The statement of grounds must be in English, French or German. The person filing the observations does not become party to the proceedings.\n\nIn the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), third parties may submit prior art relevant to a published patent application within two months of said publication or before a notice of allowance is given, whichever comes first. In contrast to European practice, however, third parties are not allowed to provide any additional explanation of the relevance of the prior art. The USPTO requires a fee.\n\nSome countries such as Australia can only accept but not grant patents after examination. The accepted patent is then advertised and public comment is sought. After the lapsing of a certain period (90 days in Australia) with no comment the patent is granted.\n\nIn July 2012, a third party observation system was also introduced for Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications. The observations have to relate to novelty and inventive step, and they may be submitted anonymously. The observations can be made at any time from the publication of the PCT application until the expiration of 28 months from the priority date. No fee is due for filing the observations.\n\nThe review of patent and patent applications through wiki projects was proposed in 2005 by patent attorney J. Matthew Buchanan on his blog. A subsequent proposal was made in \"Fortune\" magazine in 2006. The claimed purpose is the improvement of the quality of the patent examination, as well as any re-examinations, through the involvement of the public, to help identify any relevant prior art. The USPTO has endorsed some of these projects.\n\nAccording to Dave Kappos, former vice president for intellectual-property law at IBM, and later head of the USPTO, \"it's a very powerful concept because it leverages the enormous capabilities of the entire world of technical talent.\"\n\nWikipedia itself has been used by the U.S. patent examiners as a reference to get a \"quick outline of an unfamiliar topic\". Citations of Wikipedia as prior art, however, are not allowed in the U.S. due to the fluid and open nature of its editing. Nonetheless, in the related area of trademark examination, entries from Wikipedia have been cited in precedential opinions by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO.\n\nWikipedia has also been used to collect early references related to controversial patents. History of virtual learning environments, for example, is an article that was created primarily to list prior art that would potentially invalidate , “Internet-based education support system and methods”. This patent issued to Blackboard Inc. in June 2000. The Moodle wiki has a similar page. Once the patent was issued, Blackboard Inc. sued its competitor Desire2Learn to stop them from infringing the patent. In July 2009, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that all of the claims of the Blackboard patent were invalid either for being too vague or for being already in practice before Blackboard filed their application. Blackboard, however, has four continuation applications pending where it can correct the deficiencies in its claims and get new patents to issue.\n\nWhile the lawsuit was moving forward, the Software Freedom Law Center filed for a reexamination citing that new prior art had been discovered that raised a substantial new question of validity. The USPTO agreed and the patent is currently undergoing reexamination.\n\nOn June 15, 2007, the United States Patent and Trademark Office began a two-year pilot community patent review called Peer to patent or Community Patent Review. The program organizers anticipate having 250 pending software patent applications reviewed by members of the interested public. They can submit prior art along with commentary and vote on the most relevant prior art. Four months after a patent application is posted the most relevant prior art is provided to the patent examiner.\n\nIn the first five months of the program, over 20 applications have been opened to the public and 8 have completed reviews. Over 28,000 site visits have been recorded. 1,600 reviewers from more than 100 different countries have registered. Over one hundred thirty potential prior art references have been submitted. General Electric, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, and Oracle Corporation each have volunteered some of their pending patent applications for review.\n\nPatent examiners will have access to the commentary and will consider it in their examination. Applications that are part of the pilot program will get accelerated examination.\n\nOf the first 19 office actions received by Peer-to-Patent applications, 5 cited the prior art submitted by reviewers.\n\nA new pilot started on October 25, 2010, and will continue until September 30, 2011.\n\nIP.com PatentDebate is a blog-type Website were the public can comment on all pending published U.S. patent applications. User registration is required. Unlike Peer to Patent, however, there is no formal relationship between the USPTO and PatentDebate. The site is sponsored at least in part by advertising.\n\nArticle One Partners provides a community review format for enlisting members of the public to search for prior art for already issued patents. These patents are generally the subject of ongoing litigation. Anyone who signs up can earn cash rewards if they submit the most relevant prior art. Additionally, members can earn profit-sharing points for activities such as referring friends. The profit-sharing points earn them cash rewards. Article One Partners was recognized as \"2009 Startup of the Year\" by Silicon Alley Insider.\n\nThe now defunct BountyQuest was an early attempt to recruit members of the public to search for prior art for issued patents. Bounties were offered by companies for any prior art that someone could find that would invalidate the claims of a given US patent. BountyQuest existed from 2000 to 2003.\n\nPatentFizz provides a forum for commenting on issued patents and provides a simplified view of patents.\n\nPatexia is a patent research company that provides patent valuation services to companies with intellectual property portfolios by crowdsourcing the search problem to technical and scientific subject matter experts. Patexia provides a free online search engine capable of searching patents and patent litigation by patent number, company, or keyword; an online news aggregator on innovation and IP topics; a contest platform with prizes for crowdsourced patent research; and a freelance marketplace to connect its subject matter experts to businesses for direct consultation to solve technical problems for clients.\n\n\n\n"}

Formally, it is a quotient object in the category of (small) categories, analogous to a quotient group or quotient space, but in the categorical setting.\n\nLet \"C\" be a category. A \"congruence relation\" \"R\" on \"C\" is given by: for each pair of objects \"X\", \"Y\" in \"C\", an equivalence relation \"R\" on Hom(\"X\",\"Y\"), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. That is, if\nare related in Hom(\"X\", \"Y\") and\nare related in Hom(\"Y\", \"Z\"), then \"g\"\"f\" and \"g\"\"f\" are related in Hom(\"X\", \"Z\").\n\nGiven a congruence relation \"R\" on \"C\" we can define the quotient category \"C\"/\"R\" as the category whose objects are those of \"C\" and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms in \"C\". That is,\n\nComposition of morphisms in \"C\"/\"R\" is well-defined since \"R\" is a congruence relation.\n\nThere is a natural quotient functor from \"C\" to \"C\"/\"R\" which sends each morphism to its equivalence class. This functor is bijective on objects and surjective on Hom-sets (i.e. it is a full functor).\n\nEvery functor \"F\" : \"C\" → \"D\" determines a congruence on \"C\" by saying \"f\" ~ \"g\" iff \"F\"(\"f\") = \"F\"(\"g\"). The functor \"F\" then factors through the quotient functor \"C\" → \"C\"/~ in a unique manner. This may be regarded as the “first isomorphism theorem” for functors.\n\n\nIf \"C\" is an additive category and we require the congruence relation ~ on \"C\" to be additive (i.e. if \"f\", \"f\", \"g\" and \"g\" are morphisms from \"X\" to \"Y\" with \"f\" ~ \"f\" and \"g\" ~\"g\", then \"f\" + \"f\" ~ \"g\" + \"g\"), then the quotient category \"C\"/~ will also be additive, and the quotient functor \"C\" → \"C\"/~ will be an additive functor. \n\nThe concept of an additive congruence relation is equivalent to the concept of a \"two-sided ideal of morphisms\": for any two objects \"X\" and \"Y\" we are given an additive subgroup \"I\"(\"X\",\"Y\") of Hom(\"X\", \"Y\") such that for all \"f\" ∈ \"I\"(\"X\",\"Y\"), \"g\" ∈ Hom(\"Y\", \"Z\") and \"h\"∈ Hom(\"W\", \"X\"), we have \"gf\" ∈ \"I\"(\"X\",\"Z\") and \"fh\" ∈ \"I\"(\"W\",\"Y\"). Two morphisms in Hom(\"X\", \"Y\") are congruent iff their difference is in \"I\"(\"X\",\"Y\").\n\nEvery unital ring may be viewed as an additive category with a single object, and the quotient of additive categories defined above coincides in this case with the notion of a quotient ring modulo a two-sided ideal.\n\nThe localization of a category introduces new morphisms to turn several of the original category's morphisms into isomorphisms. This tends to increase the number of morphisms between objects, rather than decrease it as in the case of quotient categories. But in both constructions it often happens that two objects become isomorphic that weren't isomorphic in the original category. \n\nThe Serre quotient of an abelian category by a Serre subcategory is a new abelian category which is similar to a quotient category but also in many cases has the character of a localization of the category.\n"}

It applies purely to the geometry of an object, not to the structural analysis that deals with predicted behaviour of mechanical parts.\n\n\"Shape analysis\" is the (mostly) automatic analysis of geometric shapes, for example using a computer to detect similarly shaped objects in a database or parts that fit together. For a computer to automatically analyze and process geometric shapes, the objects have to be represented in a digital form. Most commonly a boundary representation is used to describe the object with its boundary (usually the outer shell, see also 3D model). However, other volume based representations (e.g. constructive solid geometry) or point based representations (point clouds) can be used to represent shape.\n\nOnce the objects are given, either by modeling (computer-aided design), by scanning (3D scanner) or by extracting shape from 2D or 3D images, they have to be simplified before a comparison can be achieved. The simplified representation is often called a \"shape descriptor\" (or fingerprint, signature). These simplified representations try to carry most of the important information, while being easier to handle, to store and to compare than the shapes directly.\nA \"complete shape descriptor\" is a representation that can be used to completely reconstruct the original object (for example the medial axis transform).\n\nShape analysis is used in many application fields:\n\nShape descriptors can be classified by their invariance with respect to the transformations allowed in the associated shape definition. Many descriptors are invariant with respect to \"congruency\", meaning that congruent shapes (shapes that could be translated, rotated and mirrored) will have the same descriptor (for example moment or spherical harmonic based descriptors or Procrustes analysis operating on point clouds).\n\nAnother class of shape descriptors (called \"intrinsic\" shape descriptors) is invariant with respect to isometry. These descriptors do not change with different isometric embeddings of the shape. Their advantage is that they can be applied nicely to deformable objects (e.g. a person in different body postures) as these deformations do not involve much stretching but are in fact near-isometric. Such descriptors are commonly based on geodesic distances measures along the surface of an object or on other isometry invariant characteristics such as the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum (see also spectral shape analysis).\n\nThere are other shape descriptors, such as \"graph-based\" descriptors like the medial axis or the Reeb graph that capture geometric and/or topological information and simplify the shape representation but can not be as easily compared as descriptors that represent shape as a vector of numbers.\n\nFrom this discussion it becomes clear, that different shape descriptors target different aspects of shape and can be used for a specific application. Therefore, depending on the application, it is necessary to analyze how well a descriptor captures the features of interest.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3954490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3954490", "title": "Social control theory", "text": "Social control theory\n\nIn criminology, social control theory proposes that exploiting the process of socialization and social learning builds self-control and reduces the inclination to indulge in behavior recognized as antisocial. It derives from functionalist theories of crime and was developed by Ivan Nye (1958), who proposed that there were four types of control:\n\nSocial control theory proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs encourage them not to break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and have a stake in their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply stating that human beings may choose to engage in a wide range of activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a Hobbesian view of human nature as represented in Leviathan, i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit social contracts, agreements and arrangements among people. Thus, morality is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal.\n\nThe earliest form of the theory (or at least the earliest recorded) was proposed by Edward A. Ross in 1901, who defined social control as \"the more that the smooth running of social machinery implies the frequent breaking off or turning aside of individual activities, the more perfect is the social order.\" Hence, the more perfect that the social order is, the more social control is achieved. His best-known work, Social Control (1901), deals with the reasons for and the means of societal limitation of the individual.\n\nAnother early form of the theory was proposed by Reiss (1951: 196) who defined delinquency as, \"...behavior consequent to the failure of personal and social controls.\" Personal control was defined as, \"...the ability of the individual to refrain from meeting needs in ways which conflict with the norms and rules of the community\" while social control was, \"...the ability of social groups or institutions to make norms or rules effective.\" Reiss' version did not specify the sources of such \"abilities\" nor the specific control mechanisms leading to conformity, but he did assert that the failure of primary groups such as the family to provide reinforcement for non-delinquent roles and values was crucial to the explanation of delinquency.\nReiss also wrote extensively on the application of his work to criminology.\n\nJackson Toby (1957), argued that \"the uncommitted adolescent is a candidate for gang socialization.\" acknowledging \"gang socialization\" as part of the causal, motivational dynamic leading to delinquency, but introduced the concept of \"stakes in conformity\" to explain \"candidacy\" for such learning experiences. He believed that all could be tempted into delinquency, but most refused because they considered that they had too much to lose. The young who had few stakes or investments in conformity were more likely to be drawn into gang activity. The notion of \"stakes in conformity\" fits very well with concepts invoked in later versions of social control theory.\n\nIvan Nye (1958) not only elaborated a social control theory of delinquency, but specified ways to \"operationalize\" (measure) control mechanisms and related them to self-reports of delinquent behavior. He formulated the theory after interviewing 780 young people in Washington State. The sample was criticized because it did not represent any urban environments, and those selected might have been more apt to describe their families unfavorably. Some were concerned that criminal activity was only mentioned in two of the questions, so the extrapolations to crime in general were considered unsafe. Like Reiss, he focused on the family as a source of control. Moreover, Nye specified three different types of control:\nYouth may be directly controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting the opportunity for delinquency, as well as through parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of criminogenic motivation at the time. Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, \"...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control\" (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, \"...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control...\"\n\nWalter Reckless (1961) developed containment theory by focusing on a youth's self-conception or self-image of being a good person as an insulator against peer pressure to engage in delinquency.\nThis inner containment through self-images is developed within the family and is essentially formed by about the age of twelve. Outer containment was a reflection of strong social relationships with teachers and other sources of conventional socialization within the neighborhood. The basic proposition is there are \"pushes\" and \"pulls\" that will produce delinquent behavior unless they are counteracted by containment. The motivations to deviate as pushes are:\nand the pulls are:\n\nAn analysis of 'neutralization' was developed by Sykes and Matza (1957) who believed that there was little difference between delinquents and non-delinquents, with delinquents engaging in non-delinquent behavior most of the time. They also asserted that most delinquents eventually opt out of the delinquent lifestyle as they grow older, suggesting that there is a basic code of morality in place but that the young are able to deviate by using techniques of neutralization, i.e. they can temporarily suspend the applicability of norms by developing attitudes \"favorable to deviant behavior\". The five common techniques were:\nLater Matza (1964) developed his theory of \"drift\" which proposed that people used neutralization to drift in and out of conventional behaviour, taking a temporary break from moral restraints. Matza based his \"drift\" theory upon four observations which were:\n\nAlthough this theory of drift has not been widely supported by empirical tests, it remains a key idea in criminology despite not answering why some conform and others don't.\n\nTravis Hirschi adopted Toby's concept of an investment in conventionality or \"stake in conformity\". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued that a person was less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.\n\nHirschi has since moved away from his bonding theory, and in co-operation with Michael R. Gottfredson, developed a general theory or \"self-control theory\" in 1990. Akers (1991) argued that a major weakness of this new theory was that Gottfredson and Hirschi did not define self-control and the tendency toward criminal behavior separately. By not deliberately operationalizing self-control traits and criminal behavior or criminal acts individually, it suggests that the concepts of low self-control and propensity for criminal behavior are the same. Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993) rebutted Akers argument by suggesting it was actually an indication of the consistency of general theory. That is, the theory is internally consistent by conceptualizing crime and deriving from that a concept of the offender's traits. The research community remains divided on whether the general theory is sustainable but there is emerging confirmation of some of its predictions (e.g. LaGrange & Silverman: 1999)\n\nGibbs (1989) has redefined social control and applied it to develop a control theory of homicide. Any attempt to get an individual to do or refrain from doing something can be considered an attempt at control. To qualify as 'social' control, such attempts must involve three parties. One or more individuals intends to manipulate the behavior of another by or through a third party. Gibbs' third party can be an actual person or a reference to \"society\", \"expectations\" or \"norms\". For example, if one party attempts to influence another by threatening to refer the matter to a third party assumed to have authority, this is referential social control. If one party attempts to control another by punishing a third (e.g. general deterrence), it is a form of vicarious social control. The presence of the third party distinguishes social control from mere external behavioral control, simple interpersonal responses, or issuing orders for someone to do something. This definition clearly distinguishes social control from mere \"reactions to deviance\" and from deviant behavior itself.\n\nGibbs argues that \"Homicide can be described either as control or as resulting from control failure\" (1989: 35), and proposes that the homicide rate is a function not just of the sheer volume of disputes, but also of the frequency of recourse to a third party for peaceful dispute settlement (p37). When one person fails to control the actions of another through the third party, murder represents another violent attempt at direct control. People resort to self-help when forms of social control are unavailable or fail. Gibbs is critical of Hirschi's Social Control Theory because it merely assumes that social relationships, personal investments and beliefs that discourage delinquency are social controls (which is one reason why Hirschi's theory is often referred to as a Social Bond Theory).\n\nMuch of the early research on social control theory is based on self-reporting studies. Critics of self-report data note that there may be various motives for disclosing information, and that questions may be interpreted differently by individual participants. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions are intuitively convincing, e.g. that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others, or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face imprisonment. Davies (1994 and 2004), reports that in late-nineteenth century Britain, crime rates fell dramatically, as did drug and alcohol abuse, and illegitimacy became less common. All of these indexes of deviance were fairly steady between World War I and 1955. After 1955, they all rose to create a U-curve of deviance, over the period from 1847 to 1997. He attributes the initial shift to adoption of a culture in which the assumptions of Protestant Christianity were taken for granted. Everyone at the time believed—at least somewhat—in a moral code of helping others. This belief was rooted in religion. The same social norms for the defense of the person and property that informed the law before 1955 remain the policy norms. Furthermore, the concept that people are uncontrollable and may offend against those norms in social interactions, cannot be explained by simply counting how many people practice the golden rule (see the general discussion in Braithwaite: 1989).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10181099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10181099", "title": "Standard RPG System", "text": "Standard RPG System\n\nThe Standard RPG System (SRS for short) is a Japanese role-playing game system developed by FarEast Amusement Research and used in \"Alshard\", \"Tenra War\", \"Kaze no Stigma RPG\", \"Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica RPG\" and so on. The newest, the 14th game that use SRS are the \"Full Metal Panic! RPG\" based upon the anime and light novels of the same title. SRS games are published by several companies such as Game Field, Softbank Creative, JIVE and Kadokawa(Former Enterbrain and Fujimi Shobo).\n\nStandard RPG System is available under an open content license for non-commercial uses.\n\nStandard RPG System uses only 6-sided dice. To determine whether the action is successful or not the player rolls only 2d6, if the total of the dice rolled by the player and ability/class adjustments is more than or equal to difficulty score the action succeeds. To determine damage the player rolls a number of 6-sided dice. The number of dice that are rolled increases with various class abilities.\n\nPlayers choose up to three character classes during character creation - for example, fighter/fighter/fighter (a 3rd-level fighter), valkyrie/valkyrie/scout (a 2nd-level valkyrie/1st-level scout), or black magician/white mage/wizard (a 1st-level black magician/1st-level white mage/1st-level wizard).\n\nThere are 6 attributes: \"Tairyoku\" \"Strength\", \"Hansha\" \"Reflexes\", \"Chikaku\" \"Perception\", \"Richi\" \"Reason\", \"Ishi\" \"Will\" and \"Kouun\" \"Luck\". In Tenra War, \"Tenka\", representing social ability, is present instead of \"Kouun\". Characters' attributes are decided by the selection of classes almost automatically. Attribute scores also determine the eight combat ability scores.\n\nThe game session is proceeded under the \"Scene system\" and divided into 4 phases: opening phase, middle phase, climax phase and ending phase.\nIn the opening phase, player characters (PCs) get into the incident with each one having a motivation such as business, adventure, curiosity and romantic feeling for the heroine. PCs do not need to make up a party in this phase. In the middle phase, the PCs get together. And they fight against creatures and research the incident.\nIn the climax phase, the boss enemy appears as the arch-foe against PCs. The ending phase is the phase for the epilogue.\nEach phase is also divided into several scenes. The Game Master(GM) chooses a \"scene player\" as the scene's protagonist. If the GM allows and the player succeed in an Appear roll, other PCs can appear on the scene as well.\n\nEach SRS game have a different \"Breakthrough system\" work much like hero points.\n\nIn \"Alshard\" and \"Alshard Gaia\", characters possess supreme divine powers according to their classes. For example, fighters possess the power of 'Thor', which adds extra damage to damage rolls, while white mages possess the power of 'Idun', which can raise the dead. Supreme divine powers are named \"Kago\" (加護, lit. divine protection). Each character can use \"Kago\" three times every a session, according to the three classes chosen during character creation.\n\nIn \"Tenra War\", its Breakthrough system is called \"Gou system\" (業システム, lit. karma system). Player characters earn \"Aiki\" (合気, lit. harmonious spirit) points by good roleplaying in the sessions. \"Aiki points\" can be transferred into \"Kiai\" (気合, lit. fighting spirit or willpower) points work much like costs for more powerful abilities.\n\nPlayer characters in \"Kaze no Stigma RPG\" and \"Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica RPG\" can use \"Kizuna Kouka\" (絆効果, lit. bonds effect) depends on their human relationships.\n\nTrinity x Venus SRS is based upon the superhero manga of the same title. Player Characters are the users of supernatural abilities called V.I.P. abilities. Trinity x Venus SRS's breakthrough system is named \"Advanced V.I.P. system\", PCs (player characters) can use customizable supernatural abilities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "277125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277125", "title": "Superrationality", "text": "Superrationality\n\nIn economics and game theory, a participant is considered to have superrationality (or renormalized rationality) if they have perfect rationality (and thus maximize their own utility) but assume that all other players are superrational too and that a superrational individual will always come up with the same strategy as any other superrational thinker when facing the same problem. Applying this definition, a superrational player playing against a superrational opponent in a prisoner's dilemma will cooperate while a rationally self-interested player would defect. \n\nThis decision rule is not a mainstream model within game theory and was suggested by Douglas Hofstadter in his article, series, and book \"Metamagical Themas\" as an alternative type of rational decision making different from the widely accepted game-theoretic one. Superrationality is a form of Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative. Hofstadter provided this definition: \"Superrational thinkers, by recursive definition, include in their calculations the fact that they are in a group of superrational thinkers.\"\n\nNote that contrary to the Homo reciprocans, the superrational thinker will not always play the equilibrium that maximizes the total social utility, and is thus not a philanthropist.\n\nThe idea of superrationality is that two logical thinkers analyzing the same problem will think of the same correct answer. For example, if two people are both good at math and both have been given the same complicated problem to do, both will get the same right answer. In math, knowing that the two answers are going to be the same doesn't change the value of the problem, but in game theory, knowing that the answer will be the same might change the answer itself.\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma is usually framed in terms of jail sentences for criminals, but it can be stated equally well with cash prizes instead. Two players are each given the choice to cooperate (C) or to defect (D). The players choose without knowing what the other is going to do. If both cooperate, each will get $100. If they both defect, they each get $1. If one cooperates and the other defects, then the defecting player gets $200, while the cooperating player gets nothing.\n\nThe four outcomes and the payoff to each player are listed below\n\nOne valid way for the players to reason is as follows:\n\nThe conclusion is that the rational thing to do is to defect. This type of reasoning defines game-theoretic rationality, and two game-theoretic rational players playing this game both defect and receive a dollar each.\n\nSuperrationality is an alternative method of reasoning. First, it is assumed that the answer to a symmetric problem will be the same for all the superrational players. Thus the sameness is taken into account \"before\" knowing what the strategy will be. The strategy is found by maximizing the payoff to each player, assuming that they all use the same strategy. Since the superrational player knows that the other superrational player will do the same thing, whatever that might be, there are only two choices for two superrational players. Both will cooperate or both will defect depending on the value of the superrational answer. Thus the two superrational players will both cooperate, since this answer maximizes their payoff. Two superrational players playing this game will each walk away with $100.\n\nNote that a superrational player playing against a game-theoretic rational player will defect, since the strategy only assumes that the superrational players will agree. \n\nAlthough standard game theory assumes common knowledge of rationality, it does so in a different way. The game theoretic analysis maximizes payoffs by allowing each player to change strategies independently of the others, even though in the end, it assumes that the answer in a symmetric game will be the same for all. This is the definition of a game theoretic Nash equilibrium, which defines a stable strategy as one where no player can improve the payoffs by unilaterally changing course. The superrational equilibrium in a symmetric game is one where all the players' strategies are forced to be the same before the maximization step. (There is no agreed upon extension of the concept of superrationality to asymmetric games.)\n\nSome argue that superrationality implies a kind of magical thinking in which each player supposes that their decision to cooperate will cause the other player to cooperate, despite the fact that there is no communication. Hofstadter points out that the concept of \"choice\" doesn't apply when the player's goal is to figure something out, and that the decision does not cause the other player to cooperate, but rather same logic leads to same answer independent of communication or cause and effect. This debate is over whether it is reasonable for human beings to act in a superrational manner, not over what superrationality means, and is similar to arguments about whether it is reasonable for humans to act in a 'rational' manner, as described by game theory (wherein they can figure out what other players will or have done by asking themselves, what would I do if I was them, and applying backwards induction and iterated elimination of dominated strategies).\n\nFor simplicity, the foregoing account of superrationality ignored mixed strategies: the possibility that the best choice could be to flip a coin, or more generally to choose different outcomes with some probability. In the prisoner's dilemma, it is superrational to cooperate with probability 1 even when mixed strategies are admitted, because the average payoff when one player cooperates and the other defects is the same as when both cooperate, and so defecting increases the risk of both defecting, which decreases the expected payout. But in some cases, the superrational strategy is mixed.\n\nFor example, if the payoffs in are as follows:\n\nSo that defecting has a huge reward, the superrational strategy is defecting with a probability of 499,900/999,899 or a little over 49.995%. As the reward increases to infinity, the probability only approaches 1/2 further, and the losses for adopting the simpler strategy of 1/2 (which are already minimal) approach 0. In a less extreme example, if the payoff for one cooperator and one defector was $400 and $0, respectively, the superrational mixed strategy world be defecting with probability 100/299 or about 1/3.\n\nIn similar situations with more players, using a randomising device can be essential. One example discussed by Hofstadter is the platonia dilemma: an eccentric trillionaire contacts 20 people, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him or her a telegram (assumed to cost nothing) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If they receive more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and communication between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do (if it is known that all 20 are superrational) is to send a telegram with probability p=1/20 — that is, each recipient essentially rolls a 20-sided die and only sends a telegram if it comes up \"1\". This maximizes the probability that exactly one telegram is received.\n\nNotice though that this is not the solution in a conventional game-theoretical analysis. Twenty game-theoretically rational players would each send in telegrams and therefore receive nothing. This is because sending telegrams is the dominant strategy; if an individual player sends telegrams they have a chance of receiving money, but if they send no telegrams they cannot get anything. (If all telegrams were guaranteed to arrive, they would only send one, and no one would expect to get any money.)\n\n"}
{"id": "24028642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24028642", "title": "Symbol (formal)", "text": "Symbol (formal)\n\nA logical symbol is a fundamental concept in logic, tokens of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern. Although the term \"symbol\" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the formal languages studied in mathematics and logic, the term \"symbol\" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a token instance of the symbol. In logic, symbols build literal utility to illustrate ideas.\n\nSymbols of a formal language need not be symbols \"of\" anything. For instance there are logical constants which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.\n\nA symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if it is consistent with the formation rules of the language.\n\nIn a formal system a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations. The set of formal symbols in a formal language is referred to as an alphabet (hence each symbol may be referred to as a \"letter\")\n\nA formal symbol as used in first-order logic may be a variable (member from a universe of discourse), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a predicate (mapping to T/F).\n\nFormal symbols are usually thought of as purely syntactic structures, composed into larger structures using a formal grammar, though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a formal semantics).\n\nThe move to view units in natural language (e.g. English) as formal symbols was initiated by Noam Chomsky (it was this work that resulted in the Chomsky hierarchy in formal languages). The generative grammar model looked upon syntax as autonomous from semantics. Building on these models, the logician Richard Montague proposed that semantics could also be constructed on top of the formal structure:\nThis is the philosophical premise underlying Montague grammar.\n\nHowever, this attempt to equate linguistic symbols with formal symbols has been challenged widely, particularly in the tradition of cognitive linguistics, by philosophers like Stevan Harnad, and linguists like George Lakoff and Ronald Langacker.\n\n"}
{"id": "3654105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3654105", "title": "Truthiness", "text": "Truthiness\n\nTruthiness is the belief or assertion that a particular statement is true based on the intuition or perceptions of some individual or individuals, without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or facts. Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions.\n\nThe concept of truthiness has emerged as a major subject of discussion surrounding U.S. politics during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion.\n\nAmerican television comedian Stephen Colbert coined the term \"truthiness\" in this meaning as the subject of a segment called \"The Wørd\" during the pilot episode of his political satire program \"The Colbert Report\" on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of appeal to emotion and \"gut feeling\" as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse. He particularly applied it to U.S. President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including Wikipedia. Colbert has sometimes used a Dog Latin version of the term, \"Veritasiness\". For example, in Colbert's \"Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando\" the word \"Veritasiness\" can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.\n\n\"Truthiness\" was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. Linguist and \"OED\" consultant Benjamin Zimmer pointed out that the word \"truthiness\" already had a history in literature and appears in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\"), as a derivation of \"truthy\", and \"The Century Dictionary\", both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as \"truthfulness, faithfulness\". Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert said, \"Truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister\".\n\nStephen Colbert, portraying his character Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word \"truthiness\" just moments before taping the premiere episode of \"The Colbert Report\" on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – \"truth\" – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: \"We're not talking about truth, we're talking about something that seems like truth – the truth we want to exist\", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: \"Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen.\"\n\nWhen asked in an out-of-character interview with \"The Onion\"'s A.V. Club for his views on \"the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart\", Colbert elaborated on the critique he intended to convey with the word:\n\nDuring an interview on December 8, 2006, with Charlie Rose, Colbert stated:\n\nOn his April 2, 2009 episode of \"The Colbert Report\", Colbert added an addendum to the definition: a word so straight that it drives men wild.\n\nAfter Colbert's introduction of truthiness, it quickly became widely used and recognized. Six days after, CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" featured a discussion of \"The Colbert Report\" by host Howard Kurtz, who played a clip of Colbert's definition. On the same day, ABC's \"Nightline\" also reported on truthiness, prompting Colbert to respond by saying: \"You know what was missing from that piece? Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised. \"Nightline\"'s on opposite me...\"\n\nWithin a few months of its introduction by Colbert, truthiness was discussed in \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"USA Weekly\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"Newsweek\", CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, the Associated Press, \"Editor & Publisher\", \"Salon\", \"The Huffington Post\", \"Chicago Reader\", CNET, and on ABC's \"Nightline\", CBS's \"60 Minutes\", and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nThe February 13, 2006 issue of \"Newsweek\" featured an article on \"The Colbert Report\" titled \"The Truthiness Teller\", recounting the career of the word \"truthiness\" since its popularization by Colbert.\n\nIn its issue of October 25, 2005, eight days after the premiere episode of the \"Report\", \"The New York Times\" ran its third article on \"The Colbert Report\", \"Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News\". The article specifically discussed the segment on \"truthiness\", although the \"Times\" misreported the word as \"trustiness\". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the \"Times\" ran a correction. On the next episode of the \"Report\", Colbert took the \"Times\" to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that \"trustiness\" is \"not even a word\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" again discussed \"truthiness\" in its issue of December 25, 2005, this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's zeitgeist, in an article titled \"2005: In a Word; Truthiness\" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting \"truthiness\", Steinberg said, \"the pundit who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert\".\n\nIn the January 22, 2006 issue, columnist Frank Rich used the term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled \"Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito\", to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the Samuel Alito nomination, the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, and Jack Murtha's Vietnam War record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, \"The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness.\" \"Editor & Publisher\" reported on Rich's use of \"truthiness\" in his column, saying he \"tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" published two letters on the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner, where Stephen Colbert was the featured guest, in its May 3, 2006 edition, under the headline \"Truthiness and Power\".\n\nFrank Rich referenced truthiness again in \"The New York Times\" in 2008, describing the strategy of John McCain's presidential campaign as being \"to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness\", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because \"McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it.\" Rich also noted, \"You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on \" 'The View'.\" Barbara Walters and Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face.\"\n\nUsage of \"truthiness\" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, etymology professor Anatoly Liberman began an hour-long program on public radio by discussing truthiness and predicting that it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two. His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the American Dialect Society announced that \"truthiness\" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the \"Macmillan English Dictionary\" featured \"truthiness\" as its Word of the Week a few weeks later. \"Truthiness\" was also selected by \"The New York Times\" as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. Global Language Monitor, which tracks trends in languages, named \"truthiness\" the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, \"wikiality\", as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list.\n\nThe word was listed in the annual \"Banished Word List\" released by a committee at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in 2007. The list included \"truthiness\" among other overused terms, such as \"awesome\" celebrity couple portmanteaus such as \"Brangelina\", and \"pwn\". In response, on January 8, 2007 Colbert stated that Lake Superior State University was an \"attention-seeking second-tier state university\". The 2008 List of Banished Words restored \"truthiness\" to formal usage, in response to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\nOn January 6, 2006, the American Dialect Society announced that \"truthiness\" was selected as its 2005 Word of the Year. The Society described its rationale as follows:\nIn its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted \"truthiness\" as the word of the year. First heard on \"The Colbert Report\", a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Central television channel, \"truthiness\" refers to the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As Stephen Colbert put it, \"I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart.\"\n\nOn December 10, 2006 the Merriam-Webster Dictionary announced that \"truthiness\" was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year on Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year, based on a reader poll, by a 5–1 margin over the second-place word \"google\". \"We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs\", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue.\" However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during \"The Wørd\" segment on December 12, 2006 Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured \"truthiness\". To make room for the definition of \"truthiness\", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word \"try\" was removed with Colbert stating \"Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder.\" He also sarcastically told viewers to \"not\" download the new page and \"not\" glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools.\n\nIn the June 14, 2008 edition of \"The New York Times\", the word was featured as 1-across in the crossword puzzle. Colbert mentioned this during the last segment on the June 18 episode of \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", and declared himself the \"King of the Crossword\".\n\nIn December 2009, the BBC online magazine asked its readers to nominate suggestions of things to be included on a poster which would represent important events in the 2000s (decade), divided into five different categories: \"People\", \"Words\", \"News\", \"Objects\" and \"Culture\". Suggestions were sent in and a panel of five independent experts shortened each category to what they saw as the 20 most important. Among the nominations selected in the \"Words\" category was \"Truthiness\". As a result, the word \"Truthiness\" appeared in the poster.\n\nIn 2012, a study examining truthiness was carried out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington. The experiments showed that people are more likely to believe that a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it.\n\nHillary Clinton mentions the word in her 2017 book \"What Happened\" regarding the national dissolution of objective facts.\n\nAs noted by Jesse Singal in an April 5, 2016 piece \"How the False Story of Kitty Genovese’s Murder Went Viral\" in \"New York\" magazine upon the death of Kitty Genovese's murderer, the entire escalation of a myth surrounding the murder, alleging that 38 people had been silent witnesses allowing a vicious death to proceed in front of them, was attributable to the myth's appeal to \"truthiness\" (grounded in fear – of insecurity and lack of community spirit) over full investigation into actual truth:\n\n\"Today, of course, there is exponentially more news coverage than there was in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'”\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" published an editorial in its January 16, 2006 issue titled \"The Truthiness Hurts\", crediting the rise of \"truthiness\" as serendipitously providing an apt description of the Oprah Book Club controversy over James Frey's fictionalized \"memoir\", \"A Million Little Pieces.\" \"Truthiness\" was also used to describe the controversy over the factual accuracy of Frey's book by \"USA Today\" in its January 15, 2006 issue, by several other publications including \"The New York Times,\" and by the television news program \"Nightline\" on its October 23 and January 26 editions.\n\nOprah Winfrey also discussed \"truthiness\" with Frank Rich on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column \"Truthiness 101\" Rich had recently published in \"The New York Times\". They also mentioned Colbert's role in making the word \"truthiness\".\n\nOn January 27, MSNBC ran a commentary titled \"Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert\", making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a \"small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness\", but also opportunistic and too little too late.\n\nIn 2006, Liberal Party of Canada leadership contender Ken Dryden used truthiness as an extensive theme in a speech in the House of Commons. The speech dealt critically with the Harper government's Universal Child Care Plan. Dryden defined truthiness as \"something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true.\"\n\nThe transcript of all debates in the House (Hansard) is made available in both official languages; the translators into French chose to render \"truthiness\" as \"fausse vérité\" (\"false truth\").\n\nThe Associated Press reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year, including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:\nMichael Adams, a professor at North Carolina State University who specializes in lexicology, said \"truthiness\" means \"truthy, not facty\". \"The national argument right now is, one, 'Who's got the truth?' and, two, 'Who's got the facts? he said. \"Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going to make much progress.\"\nOn each of the first four episodes of the \"Report\" after the selection of \"truthiness\" as \"Word of the Year,\" Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his \"On Notice\" board, and Associated Press reporter Heather Clark, the author of the article, to his \"Dead to Me\" board:\n\n\"You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, written by one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me,\" Colbert said during his show Monday. \"I'm not mentioned, despite the fact that truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister.\"\n\nLater Adams admitted the \"absolutely hilarious\" nature of the show and said he couldn't \"think of any greater honor than to be placed on Colbert's 'On Notice' board,\" and that he \"owes Colbert thanks.\"\n\nOn the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the \"Threat-Down\", one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of bears. On the following episode he called Adams and asked for an apology. Though Adams never apologized, Colbert \"accepted\" his \"apology\", but failed to take him \"off notice\".\n\nOn January 13, the first day after the four-day run of criticism of the AP on the \"Report,\" the AP ran a story about \"The Colbert Report\" being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled \"Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America\". As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of \"truthiness\"; excerpts of the story are:\n\n\"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his muse Bill O'Reilly might lead in all seriousness.\"\n\nIt's a sin of omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...'It's like Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what \"Hamlet\" is about,' he said.\"\n\n\"The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s...'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.\n\n\"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as \"The New York Times\" wrote, 'a summation of what [Colbert] sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.\n\n\"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting leading up to the Iraq War. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'\"\n\nOn January 14, Clark herself responded in an article titled \"Exclusive 'News' – I'm dead to Stephen Colbert\". She furthered the rise of \"truthiness\" in published English in conceding, \"Truthiness be told, I never had seen \"The Colbert Report\" until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time...It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact.\"\n\nOn January 31, 2006, Arianna Huffington used \"truthiness\" in The Huffington Post. Huffington later appeared as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of \"The Colbert Report\". She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word \"truthiness\". During the interview, Colbert declared, \"I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father.\" Huffington corrected him, citing Wikipedia, that he had merely \"popularized\" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: \"Fuck them!\"\n\nAt the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Colbert, the featured guest, described President Bush's thought processes using the definition of truthiness. \"Editor and Publisher\" used \"truthiness\" to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, in an article published the same day titled \"Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner—President Not Amused?\" \"E&P\" reported that the \"blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush ... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close\" and that many people at the dinner \"looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting—or too much speaking 'truthiness' to power\". \"E&P\" reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew \"possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever\", and published a letter to the editor asserting that \"Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness\". On the same weekend, \"The Washington Post\" and others also reported on the event. Six months later, in a column titled \"Throw The Truthiness Bums Out\", \"The New York Times\" columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a \"cultural primary\" and christened it the \"defining moment\" of the United States' 2006 midterm elections.\n\nConservative commentator Charles Krauthammer brought the term up in a discussion about President Obama on the show \"Fox News All-Stars\" in June 2010, saying:\nIn 2014, the Cato Institute filed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court co-authored by humorist P. J. O'Rourke in the \"Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus\" free speech case. The brief included an extended discussion of the role of truthiness in American political discourse:\n\nColbert refreshed \"truthiness\" in an episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on July 18, 2016, using the neologism \"Trumpiness\" regarding statements made by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, \"Trumpiness\" does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a \"Washington Post\" column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his \"wildest promises\" but supported him anyway.\n\n"}

Green algae traditionally excludes the land plants, rendering them a paraphyletic group. Since the realization that the embryophytes emerged from within the green algae, some authors are starting to include them. They have cells with cellulose in their cell walls, and primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria that contain chlorophylls a and b and lack phycobilins. More than 350,000 species of Viridiplantae exist.\n\nIn some classification systems, the group has been treated as a kingdom, under various names, e.g. Viridiplantae, Chlorobionta, or simply Plantae, the latter expanding the traditional plant kingdom to include the green algae. Adl\" et al.\", who produced a classification for all eukaryotes in 2005, introduced the name Chloroplastida for this group, reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll. They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that some of the species are not plants, as understood traditionally. The Viridiplantae are made up of two clades: Chlorophyta and Streptophyta as well as the basal Mesostigmatophyceae and Chlorokybophyceae.

{"id": "89637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89637", "title": "Vulgarism", "text": "Vulgarism\n\nIn the study of language and literary style, a vulgarism is an expression or usage considered non-standard or characteristic of uneducated speech or writing. In colloquial or lexical English, \"vulgarism\" or \"vulgarity\" may be synonymous with profanity or obscenity, but a linguistic or literary vulgarism encompasses a broader category of perceived fault not confined to scatological or sexual offensiveness. These faults may include errors of pronunciation, misspellings, word malformations, and malapropisms. \"Vulgarity\" is generally used in the more restricted sense. In regular and mostly informal conversations, the presence of vulgarity, if any, are mostly for intensifying, exclaiming or scolding. In modern times, vulgarism continues to be frequently used by people. A research paper produced by Oxford University in 2005 shows that the age group of 10-21 years old speak more vulgarity than the rest of the world's population combined. The frequent and prevalent usage of vulgarity as a whole has led to a paradox, in which people use vulgarity so often that it becomes less and less offensive to people, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe English word \"vulgarism\" derives ultimately from Latin \"vulgus,\" \"the common people\", often as a pejorative meaning \"the [unwashed] masses, undifferentiated herd, a mob\". In classical studies, Vulgar Latin as the Latin of everyday life is conventionally contrasted to Classical Latin, the literary language exemplified by the \"Golden Age\" canon (Cicero, Caesar, Vergil, Ovid, among others). This distinction was always an untenable mode of literary criticism, unduly problematizing, for instance, the so-called \"Silver Age\" novelist Petronius, whose complex and sophisticated prose style in the \"Satyricon\" is full of conversational vulgarisms.\n\nVulgarism has been a particular concern of British English traditionalists. In the 1920s, the English lexicographer Henry Wyld defined \"vulgarism\" as:a peculiarity which intrudes itself into Standard English, and is of such a nature as to be associated with the speech of vulgar or uneducated speakers. The origin of pure \"vulgarisms\" is usually that they are importations, not from a regional but from a class dialect—in this case from a dialect which is not that of a province, but of a low or uneducated social class. ... [A vulgarism] is usually a variety of Standard English, but a bad variety. The moral and aesthetic values explicit in such a definition depends on class hierarchy viewed as authoritative. For instance, the \"misuse\" of aspiration (H-dropping, such as pronouncing \"have\" as ave\") has been considered a mark of the lower classes in England at least since the late 18th century, as dramatized in \"My Fair Lady\". Because linguistic vulgarism betrayed social class, its avoidance became an aspect of etiquette. In 19th-century England, books such as \"The Vulgarisms and Improprieties of the English Language\" (1833) by W. H. Savage, reflected upper-middle-class anxieties about \"correctness and good breeding\".\n\nVulgarisms in a literary work may be used deliberately to further characterization, by use of \"eye dialect\" or simply by vocabulary choice.\n\n"}
{"id": "26302071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26302071", "title": "What Darwin Got Wrong", "text": "What Darwin Got Wrong\n\nWhat Darwin Got Wrong is a 2010 book by philosopher Jerry Fodor and cognitive scientist Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, in which the authors criticize Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. It is an extension of an argument first presented as \"Why Pigs Don't Have Wings\" in the \"London Review of Books\".\n\nFodor published an article, entitled \"Why Pigs Don't Have Wings\", in the \"London Review of Books\" in October 2007. It stated that \"In fact, an appreciable number of perfectly reasonable biologists are coming to think that the theory of natural selection can no longer be taken for granted.\"\n\nIn support of this proposed disestablishment of natural selection, the article stated two arguments:\n\n\nThe \"London Review of Books\" published eleven letters (including two from Fodor himself) over the following three months. They included negative responses from Simon Blackburn, Tim Lewens, Jerry Coyne and Philip Kitcher, and Daniel Dennett and a mixed response from Steven Rose.\n\nCoyne and Kitcher dispute Fodor's \"striking claim that evolutionary biologists are abandoning natural selection as the principal, or even an important, cause of evolutionary change\" and state that \"[t]his is news to us, and, we believe, will be news to most knowledgeable people as well.\" They go on to criticise his conceptual and empirical issues, and state that \"[t]he rival mechanisms Fodor cites are supplements to natural selection, not replacements\", and that \"Evo-devo is not an alternative to adaptation; rather, it is a way to explain how the genes mechanistically produce adaptations.\" Evolutionary developmental biologist PZ Myers has expressed a similar criticism of this characterisation of evolutionary developmental biology.\n\nDennett states that Fodor's discussion of Gould and Lewontin’s spandrel argument misrepresents that argument, stating \"that far from suggesting an alternative to adaptationism, the very concept of a spandrel depends on there being adaptations\".\n\nBlackburn writes that \"His problem is fortunately quite easily solved [...] Two traits may be found together in nature, but one can play a causal role in producing a reproductive advantage, when the other does not.\" We can thus know that the trait that gives the advantage is the one being selected. Fodor replies that the problem is not merely about our knowledge of what is being selected, but the process of selection itself: \"how can the operation of selection distinguish traits that are coextensive in a creature's ecology?\" Blackburn writes back that Fodor's question is irrelevant to the process of natural selection as actually formulated by biologists, \"viz.\" organisms with genes that enhance reproductive success are more likely to pass on genes to the next generation, and so the frequency of those genes increases. \"Is this incoherent? Nothing Fodor says bears on that question.\"\n\nThe book is divided into two parts. Part One is a review of \"new facts and new non-selectional mechanisms that have been discovered in biology\". Part Two is a discussion of \"the logical and conceptual bases of the theory of natural selection\". At the outset, the authors state their atheism and commitment to naturalistic explanations, and add that they accept evolution and common descent, but doubt that evolution proceeds by natural selection.\n\nThe authors' central argument against the concept of natural selection is what they call \"the problem of selection-for\". An extension of Gould and Lewontin's concept of spandrels, the authors note that certain traits of organisms always come together. The authors give examples:\n\n\nBecause these traits come together, they are both correlated with fitness. Therefore, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini argue that the theory of natural selection \"cannot predict/explain what traits the creatures in a population are selected-for\", and so \"the claim that selection is the mechanism of evolution cannot be true\".\n\nAnother way the authors put the same point is as follows: If the mechanism of natural selection (as it is currently formulated) is correct, then it is a paradigm example of intensional causation. Intensional causation requires either (1) there be a mind involved in the causal process, or (2) the causal mechanism has access to nomological laws. Since there is neither (1) nor (2) at the biological level, the theory of natural selection cannot be correct. \n\nIn a response, published by the \"London Review of Books\" in November 2007, to \"Why Pigs Don't Have Wings\", Tim Lewens states that Elliott Sober gave the following solution to this problem in 1984:\n\nLewens continues:\nFodor and Piattelli-Palmarini published a short summary of their book in \"New Scientist\".\n\nThe philosopher Mary Midgley wrote that \"What Darwin Got Wrong\" \"strikes an outsider as an overdue and valuable onslaught on neo-Darwinist simplicities\".\nThe journalist Oliver Burkeman wrote an article entitled \"Why everything you've been told about evolution is wrong\" in \"The Guardian\" but concludes \"It would be jawdroppingly surprising, to say the least, were Fodor to be right. A safer, if mealy-mouthed, conclusion to draw is that his work acts as an important warning to those of us who think we understand natural selection\".\n\nThe book also received a positive review from intelligent-design proponent William Dembski.\n\nThe philosophers Michael Ruse, Philip Kitcher (writing with philosopher of mind Ned Block) and Massimo Pigliucci have written reviews critical of the book.\n\nPigliucci criticises the first part of the book for claiming that 'Darwinism' \"put[s] far too much emphasis on external causes of biological change, namely natural selection, and has ignored internal mechanisms\", whilst failing to acknowledge that biology has long addressed such internal mechanisms, with Darwin himself \"explicitly referring his readers to ‘the laws of correlation of growth’ – that is, to the fact that the internal structure of living organisms imposes limits and direction to evolution\". He criticises the second part of the book for raising correlated traits as a new issue when \"Biologists have long known about the problem\" and have dealt with it:\nRuse makes the following suggestion for the motivation for the book:\nThe evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne describes this book as \"a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection\" and \"as biologically uninformed as it is strident\".\n\nIn a review in \"Science\" Douglas J. Futuyma concluded:\nAdam Rutherford, writing in \"The Guardian\", also reviewed the book negatively.\n\n\n\n"}

White-collar work may be performed in an office or other administrative setting. Other types of work are those of a blue-collar worker, whose job requires manual labor and a pink-collar worker, whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales, or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white and pink (service) industry categorizations.\n\nThe term refers to the white dress shirts of male office workers common through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Western countries, as opposed to the blue overalls worn by many manual laborers.\n\nThe term \"white collar\" is credited to Upton Sinclair, an American writer, in relation to contemporary clerical, administrative, and management workers during the 1930s, though references to white-collar work appear as early as 1935.\n\nFormerly a minority in the agrarian and early industrial societies, white-collar workers have become a majority in industrialized countries due to modernization and outsourcing of manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe blue-collar and white-collar descriptors as it pertains to work dress may no longer be an accurate descriptor as office attire has broadened beyond a white shirt and tie. Employees in office environments may wear a variety of colors, may dress business casual or wear casual clothes altogether. In addition work tasks have blurred. \"White-collar\" employees may perform \"blue-collar\" tasks (or vice versa). An example would be a restaurant manager who may wear more formal clothing yet still assist with cooking food or taking customers' orders or a construction worker who also performs desk work.\nLess physical activity among white-collar workers has been thought to be a key factor in increased life-style related health conditions such as fatigue, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and heart disease. Workplace interventions such as alternative activity workstations, sit-stand desks, promotion of stair use are among measures being implemented to counter the harms of sedentary workplace environments. A Cochrane systematic review published in 2018 concluded that \"At present there is low-quality evidence that the use of sit-stand desks reduce workplace sitting.\" Also, evidence was lacking on the long term health benefits of such interventions.\n\n\n"}
