{"id": "14934336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14934336", "title": "2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future", "text": "2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future\n\nPrinceton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill's 1981 book, 2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future was an attempt to predict the technological and social state of humanity 100 years in the future. O'Neill's positive attitude towards both technology and human potential distinguished this book from gloomy predictions of a Malthusian catastrophe by contemporary scientists. Paul R. Ehrlich wrote in 1968 in \"The Population Bomb\", \"in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death\". The Club of Rome's 1972 \"Limits to Growth\" predicted a catastrophic end to the Industrial Revolution within 100 years from resource exhaustion and pollution.\n\nO'Neill's contrary view had two main components. First, he analyzed the previous attempts to predict the future of society—including many catastrophes that had not materialized. Second, he extrapolated historical trends under the assumption that the obstacles identified by other authors would be overcome by five technological \"Drivers of Change\". He extrapolated an average American family income in 2081 of $1 million/year. Two developments based on his own research were responsible for much of his optimism. In \"\" O'Neill described solar power satellites that provide unlimited clean energy, making it far easier for humanity to reach and exceed present developed-world living standards. Overpopulation pressures would be relieved as billions of people eventually emigrate to colonies in free space. These colonies would offer an Earth-like environment but with vastly higher productivity for industry and agriculture. These colonies and satellites would be constructed from asteroid or lunar materials launched into the desired orbits cheaply by the mass drivers O'Neill's group developed.\n\nPrevious futurist authors he cites:\n\nArthur C. Clarke's \"Profiles of the Future\" included a long list of predictions, many of which O'Neill endorsed. Two of his maxims that O'Neill quotes seem to sum up O'Neill's attitude, as well:\n\nSections are included on the five key \"Drivers of Change\" believed by O'Neill to be the focus of future development:\n\nO'Neill applied basic physics to understand the limits of possible change, using the history of the technology to extrapolate likely progress. He applied the history of computing to reason about how people and institutions will shape and be shaped by the likely changes. He predicted that future computers must run at a very low-voltage because of heat. The main basis of his technology extrapolation for computers is Moore's Law, one of the greatest successes of Trend estimation in predicting human progress.\n\nHis predicted the social aspects of the future of computers. He identified computers as the most certain of his five \"drivers of change\", because their adoption could be driven primarily by individual or local decisions, while the other four such as space colonies depended on large-scale decision-making. He observed the success of minicomputers, calculators, and the first home computers, and predicted that every home would have a computer in a hundred years. With the aid of speculations by computer pioneers such as John von Neumann and the writers of \"tracts\" such as Zamyatin's \"We\", O'Neill also predicted that privacy would be under siege from computers in 2081.\n\nO'Neill predicted that software engineering issues and the intractability of artificial intelligence problems would require massive programming efforts and very powerful processors to achieve truly usable computers. His prediction was based on the difficulties and failures of computer use he had observed in 1981, including a candid horror story of his own Princeton University library's attempt to computerize its operations. His computers of the future, represented by the robot butler his visitor to Earth encounters in 2081, included speaker-independent speech recognition and natural language processing. O'Neill correctly pointed out the huge difference between computers and human brains, and stated that, while a more human-like artificial brain is a worthy goal, computers will be vastly improved descendants of today's rather than truly intelligent and creative artificial brains.\n\nThis section was written as a series of dispatches home from \"Eric C. Rawson\", a native of a distant space colony called \"Fox Cluster\". By analogy with American religious colonists such as the Puritans and Mormons, O'Neill suggests that such a colony might have been founded by a group of pacifists who chose to live about twice as far from the Sun as Pluto in order to avoid involvement in Earth's wars. His calculations indicate that colonies at this distance could have Earth-level sunlight using a mirror the same weight as the colony itself. Eric pays a visit to the Earth of 2081 to take care of family business and explore a world that is nearly as foreign to him as it is to us.\n\nAfter each dispatch, O'Neill added a section that described his reasoning for each situation the visitor described, such as riding a \"floater\" train going thousands of miles per hour in vacuum, interacting with a household robot or visiting a fully enclosed Pennsylvania city with a tropical climate in midwinter. Each section was written from his perspective as a physicist. For example, his description of \"Honolulu, Pennsylvania\" included multiple roof layers that could be retracted in good weather. The city enjoyed an artificial tropical climate all year because of internal climate controls and advanced insulation. He also proposed magnetically levitated \"floater\" trains moving in very-low-pressure tunnels that would replace airplanes on heavily traveled routes.\n\nThis section explores, not the most probable outcomes, but \"the limits of the possible\": how likely some scenarios O'Neill considered less probable are, and what they might mean. These included nuclear annihilation, attaining immortality, and contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. For this last case, he presents a thought experiment about how a hypothetical alien civilization, the \"Primans\", could explore the galaxy with self-replicating robots, monitoring every planetary system in the Galaxy without betraying their own position, and destroying intelligent life (by building giant mirrors to incinerate the planet) if they felt threatened. This experiment seems to prove that conflict or even surprise contact with an intelligent alien life form—that staple of science fiction—is highly unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35742703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35742703", "title": "3D bioprinting", "text": "3D bioprinting\n\nThree dimensional (3D) bioprinting is the utilization of 3D printing and 3D printing–like techniques to combine cells, growth factors, and biomaterials to fabricate biomedical parts that maximally imitate natural tissue characteristics. Generally, 3D bioprinting utilizes the layer-by-layer method to deposit materials known as bioinks to create tissue-like structures that are later used in medical and tissue engineering fields. Bioprinting covers a broad range of biomaterials.\n\nCurrently, bioprinting can be used to print tissues and organs to help research drugs and pills. However, emerging innovations span from bioprinting of cells or extracellular matrix deposited into a 3D gel layer by layer to produce the desired tissue or organ. In addition, 3D bioprinting has begun to incorporate the printing of scaffolds. These scaffolds can be used to regenerate joints and ligaments.\n\n3D bioprinting generally follows three steps, pre-bioprinting, bioprinting, and post-bioprinting.\n\nPre-bioprinting is the process of creating a model that the printer will later create and choosing the materials that will be used. One of the first steps is to obtain a biopsy of the organ. Common technologies used for bioprinting are computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To print with a layer-by-layer approach, tomographic reconstruction is done on the images. The now-2D images are then sent to the printer to be made. Once the image is created, certain cells are isolated and multiplied. These cells are then mixed with a special liquefied material that provides oxygen and other nutrients to keep them alive. In some processes, the cells are encapsulated in cellular spheroids 500μm in diameter. This aggregation of cells does not require a scaffold, and are required for placing in the tubular-like tissue fusion for processes such as extrusion.\n\nIn the second step, the liquid mixture of cells, matrix, and nutrients known as bioinks are placed in a printer cartridge and deposited using the patients' medical scans. When a bioprinted pre-tissue is transferred to an incubator, this cell-based pre-tissue matures into a tissue.\n\n3D bioprinting for fabricating biological constructs typically involves dispensing cells onto a biocompatible scaffold using a successive layer-by-layer approach to generate tissue-like three-dimensional structures. Artificial organs such as livers and kidneys made by 3D bioprinting have been shown to lack crucial elements that affect the body such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, and the growth of billions of cells required for these organs. Without these components the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within their interiors. Given that every tissue in the body is naturally composed of different cell types, many technologies for printing these cells vary in their ability to ensure stability and viability of the cells during the manufacturing process. Some of the methods that are used for 3D bioprinting of cells are photolithography, magnetic bioprinting, stereolithography, and direct cell extrusion.\n\nThe post-bioprinting process is necessary to create a stable structure from the biological material. If this process is not well-maintained, the mechanical integrity and function of the 3D printed object is at risk. To maintain the object, both mechanical and chemical stimulations are needed. These stimulations send signals to the cells to control the remodeling and growth of tissues. In addition, in recent development, bioreactor technologies have allowed the rapid maturation of tissues, vascularization of tissues and the ability to survive transplants.\n\nBioreactors work in either providing convective nutrient transport, creating microgravity environments, changing the pressure causing solution to flow through the cells, or add compression for dynamic or static loading. Each type of bioreactor is ideal for different types of tissue, for example compression bioreactors are ideal for cartilage tissue.\n\nResearchers in the field have developed approaches to produce living organs that are constructed with the appropriate biological and mechanical properties. 3D bioprinting is based on three main approaches: Biomimicry, autonomous self-assembly and mini-tissue building blocks.\n\nThe first approach of bioprinting is called biomimicry. The main goal of this approach is to create fabricated structures that are identical to the natural structure that are found in the tissues and organs in the human body. Biomimicry requires duplication of the shape, framework, and the microenvironment of the organs and tissues. The application of biomimicry in bioprinting involves creating both identical cellular and extracellular parts of organs. For this approach to be successful, the tissues must be replicated on a micro scale. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the microenvironment, the nature of the biological forces in this microenvironment, the precise organization of functional and supporting cell types, solubility factors, and the composition of extracellular matrix.\n\nThe second approach of bioprinting is autonomous self-assembly. This approach relies on the physical process of embryonic organ development as a model to replicate the tissues of interest. When cells are in their early development, they create their own extracellular matrix building block, the proper cell signaling, and independent arrangement and patterning to provide the required biological functions and micro-architecture. Autonomous self-assembly demands specific information about the developmental techniques of the tissues and organs of the embryo. There is a \"scaffold-free\" model that uses self-assembling spheroids that subjects to fusion and cell arrangement to resemble evolving tissues. Autonomous self-assembly depends on the cell as the fundamental driver of histogenesis, guiding the building blocks, structural and functional properties of these tissues. It demands a deeper understanding of how embryonic tissues mechanisms develop as well as the microenvironment surrounded to create the bioprinted tissues.\n\nThe third approach of bioprinting is a combination of both the biomimicry and self-assembly approaches, which is called mini tissues. Organs and tissues are built from very small functional components. Mini-tissue approach takes these small pieces and manufacture and arrange them into larger framework.\n\nAkin to ordinary ink printers, bioprinters have three major components to them. These are the hardware used, the type of bio-ink, and the material it is printed on (biomaterials).\n\"Bio-ink is a material made from living cells that behaves much like a liquid, allowing people to \"print\" it in order to create a desired shape. To make bio-ink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as bio-paper.\"\n\nIn bioprinting, there are three major types of printers that have been used. These are inkjet, laser-assisted, and extrusion printers. Inkjet printers are mainly used in bioprinting for fast and large-scale products. One type of inkjet printer, called drop-on-demand inkjet printer, prints materials in exact amounts, minimizing cost and waste. Printers that utilize lasers provide high-resolution printing; however, these printers are often expensive. Extrusion printers print cells layer-by-layer, just like 3D printing to create 3D constructs. In addition to just cells, extrusion printers may also use hydrogels infused with cells.\n\n3D bioprinting contributes to significant advances in the medical field of tissue engineering by allowing for research to be done on innovative materials called biomaterials. Biomaterials are the materials adapted and used for printing three-dimensional objects. Some of the most notable bioengineered substances are usually stronger than the average bodily materials, including soft tissue and bone. These constituents can act as future substitutes, even improvements, for the original body materials. Alginate, for example, is an anionic polymer with many biomedical implications including feasibility, strong biocompatibility, low toxicity, and stronger structural ability in comparison to some of the body's structural material. Synthetic hydrogels are also commonplace, including PV-based gels. The combination of acid with a UV-initiated PV-based cross-linker has been evaluated by the Wake Forest Institute of Medicine and determined to be a suitable biomaterial. Engineers are also exploring other options such as printing micro-channels that can maximize the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from neighboring tissues In addition, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency aims to print mini organs such as hearts, livers, and lungs as the potential to test new drugs more accurately and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1989064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989064", "title": "Al-Maʿarri", "text": "Al-Maʿarri\n\nAbu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri (Arabic ', full name '; December 973 – May 1057) was a blind Arab philosopher, poet, and writer. Al-Maʿarri held and expressed an irreligious worldview which was met with controversy, but in spite of it, he is regarded as one of the greatest classical Arabic poets.\n\nBorn in the city of Maʿarra during the Abbasid era, he studied in nearby Aleppo, then in Tripoli and Antioch. Producing popular poems in Baghdad, he nevertheless refused to sell his texts. In 1010, he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health, and continued writing which gained him local respect.\n\nDescribed as a \"pessimistic freethinker\", Al-Maʿarri was a controversial rationalist of his time, citing reason as the chief source of truth. He was pessimistic about life, describing himself as \"a double prisoner\" of blindness and isolation. He attacked the dogmas of religion, criticized and rejected Islam, and became a Deist. He was equally critical and sarcastic about Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. He advocated social justice and lived a secluded, ascetic lifestyle. He became a vegan, entreating: \"do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals / Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught /\nfor their young\". Al-Maʿarri held an antinatalist thought, in line with his general pessimism, suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains and suffering of life.\n\nAl-Maʿarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time. Among his works are \"The Tinder Spark\", \"Unnecessary Necessity\", and \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" (\"Resalat Al-Ghufran\") which may be considered a precursor to Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". Al-Maʿarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was beheaded by jihadists from the al-Nusra Front.\n\nAbu al-ʿAlaʾ was born in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nu'man, Syria, near the city of Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate, the third Islamic caliphate, during the Golden Age of Islam. He was a member of the \"Banu Sulayman\", a notable family of Maʿarra, belonging to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the \"Banu Sulayman\" had also been noted as good poets.\n\nHe lost his eyesight at the age of four due to smallpox. His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness. Later in his life, he regarded himself as \"a double prisoner\" which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life.\n\nHe started his career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE, when al-Maʿarri was still a child. Al-Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his \"Risālat al-ghufrān\". Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.\n\nIn 1004–05 al-Maʿarri learned that his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well received in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival.\n\nHe remained in Maʿarra for the rest of his life, where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle, refusing to sell his poems, living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet. His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town. Though he was confined, he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others. He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally, as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad. Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle, in his seventies, he became rich and was the most revered person in his area. Al-Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his home town.\n\nAl-Maʿarri was a sceptic in his beliefs who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion. This, along with his general negative view on life, has made him described as a pessimistic freethinker. One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of reason against the claims of custom, tradition, and authority. Al-Maʿarri taught that religion was a \"fable invented by the ancients\", worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses.\n\nAl-Maʿarri criticized many of the dogmas of Islam, such as the Hajj, which he called \"a pagan's journey\". He rejected claims of any divine revelation and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic, for whom reason provides a moral guide, and virtue is its own reward.\n\nHis religious scepticism and positively antireligious views extended beyond Islam and included both Judaism and Christianity, as well. Al-Maʿarri remarked that monks in their cloisters or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality: if they were born among Magians or Sabians they would have become Magians or Sabians. Encapsulating his view on organized religion, he once stated: \"The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains.\"\n\nAl-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works. He opposed all forms of violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, he decided not to sell his texts, which made it difficult for him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.\n\nIn al-Maʿarri's later years, he became a vegan, neither consuming meat nor any other animal products. He wrote:\nAl-Maʿarri's fundamental pessimism is expressed in his antinatalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him over the loss of a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life:\n\nEven on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.\n\nAl-Maʿarri is controversial even today as he was sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab world. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of al-Maʿarri during the Syrian civil war. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family.\n\nStill, al-Maʿarri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets. Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet Lucretius, calling them progressive for their time.\n\nAn early collection of his poems appeared as \"The Tinder Spark\" (\"Saqṭ al-zand\"; ). The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the Hamdanid ruler Sa'd al-Dawla. It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet. A few poems in the collection were about armour.\n\nA second, more original collection appeared under the title \"Unnecessary Necessity\" (\"Luzūm mā lam yalzam\" ), also simply \"Luzūmīyāt\" or \"Necessities\". The title refers to how al-Maʿarri saw the business of living and alludes to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used.\n\nHis third famous work is a work of prose known as \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" (\"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" ).\nThe work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al-Qarih, whom al-Maʿarri mocks for his religious views. In this work, the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period, contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find salvation.\nBecause of the aspect of conversing with the deceased in paradise, the \"Resalat Al-Ghufran\" has been compared to the \"Divine Comedy\" of Dante which came hundreds of years after. The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn Shuhayd's \"Risala al-tawabi' wa al-zawabi\", though there is no evidence that al-Maʿarri was inspired by Ibn Shahayd nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by al-Maʿarri. Algeria reportedly banned \"The Epistle of Forgiveness\" from the International Book Fair held in Algiers in 2007.\n\n\"Paragraphs and Periods\" (\"Al-Fuṣūl wa al-ghāyāt\") is a collection of homilies. The work has also been called a parody of the Quran.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7742492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7742492", "title": "An-Nisa, 34", "text": "An-Nisa, 34\n\nAn-Nisa, 34 (also known as Quran 4:34) is the 34th verse of chapter (\"surah\") #4 of the Quran (titled An-Nisa/The Women).\n\nThere are a number of translations that differ on the specific interpretations of the words.\n\nMarmaduke Pickthall:\n\nAbdullah Yusuf Ali:\n\nSahih International, at Quran.com:\n\nAhmad Shafaat:\n\nMuhsin Khan, at Quran.com:\n\nMuhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri:\n\nLaleh Bakhtiar, PhD:\nMaulvi Sher Ali on behalf of the Ahmadiyya religion:\n\nThere are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.\n\nIn the Prophet's farewell sermon as recorded in al-Tabari's History, and similarly in a \"hadith\" collected by Abu Dawud, he instructed husbands to beat their wives, but not severely (فَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ضَرْبًا غَيْرَ مُبَرِّحٍ \"fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih\"; literal translation: \"beat them, a beating without severity\") if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husband's absence; according to the cited farewell address sermon in al-Tabari's history, for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to \"tread\" on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband. This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited, but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol. IX of Al-Tabari's history. Ibn 'Abbas, a companion of the Prophet, is recorded in the Tafsir of al-Tabari for verse 4:34 as saying that beating without severity is using a \"siwak\" (small tooth cleaning twig) or a similar object. There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it. In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud, Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face.\n\nAnother hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah. The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated, \"hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark.\"\n\nIn his \"Arabic-English Lexicon\", Edward William Lane notes various definitions for the Arabic word \"\"Lahada\"” such as \"\"Lahada\" means push, which appears in the first hadith and is rendered as \"he struck\" in the English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.\n\nThere have been several fatwas against domestic violence. Feminist writers have argued that society during Quranic times differed from modern times, especially in how children were reared and raised, creating a need for gender roles. However, these scholars highlight that the Qur'an can be interpreted differently as society changes.\n\nJonathan A.C. Brown gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse:\n\nThe first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards God, not the husband.\n\nThe Qur'an states that men are the guardians of women, and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives. Women, however, are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property, provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband, provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles. Nevertheless, they are responsible for educating the children, as God has given the one preference over the other. Man is also considered to be the head of the family. The Qur'an recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands. Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity. Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system.\n\nFor both men and women, \"zulm\"- known in English as actions of 'cruelty' against someone- is explicitly prohibited.\n\nThe equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text. The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them.\nThe Qur'an is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings (24:2), and that both men and women are seen as equals under God, and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven (4:124).\n\nIn her book \"Qur'an and Women\", scholar Amina Wadud writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet. During this time, women did not have access to the technology that women today have; giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge. For this reason, Wadud writes, \"The Qur'an establishes his [the husband's] responsibility as \"qiwamah\": seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill.\" The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet.\n\nScholar Ayesha Chaudhry writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text, writing that \"Despite the potential for such verses [4:34] to have multiple plain-sense meanings, living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the pre-colonial Islamic tradition\".\n\nThe late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabataba'i (1903-1981 AD) provides the following exegesis on 4:34 from both Sunni and Shi'ite sources in his Mizan:Ibn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ash’ath ibn ‘Abdil-Malik from al-Hasan that he said: “A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her. The Messenger of Allah said: “Retribution”. Then Allah revealed the verse, “Men are maintainers of women… (4:34); so the woman returned without retribution [ad-Durr 'l-munthur, as-Suyuti]. [as-Suyuti] has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too. Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said: “I wanted one thing (retribution), but Allah decided otherwise\"...there were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it, but it was only in his administrative order, not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people, otherwise it would have been an invalid nullification...the Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud: \"How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with?\". It is narrated also in al-Kafi through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Ja’far (Imam Muhammad al-Baqir) that he said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “What! Does one of you hit his wife, and then attempt to embrace her?\". Countless such statements are found in the traditions; and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subject.Al-Tabari (839-923 AD) wrote that, \"The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives, or against a slave, nor against any person at all.\" In fact, when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives, rather than beat him, Al-Tabari accounts that he instead, \"stayed away from his wives for 29 nights.\"\n\nIn response to \"nushûz\", admonishment, leaving wives in their beds and \"idribihunna\" are permitted. Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the Qur'an (see \"nushûz\").\n\nThis allots men authority over women due to following reasons:\n1: Because God has given some more strength than others.\n2: Because men spent from their property to support women i.e., \nclothing, residence, and sustenance.The word \"qawwamun\" is also used at Al-Quran 4:134. Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness.\n\nOne of the reason men being \"qawwamun\" over women is that God has favoured some over others.\n\nSecond reason of men being \"qawwamun\" over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women.\n\nThe verse declares that pious women are:\n1: Obedient\n2: Guarding the unseen as God prescribes.\n\nThe verse commands women to be \"qanitat\". The term has been used in to refer to men and women alike, who are obedient to God. Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband, while others assert that it means obedience to God. Some \"scholars\" agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife, and her first loyalty is to God.\n\n\"Hafizat\" is derived from \"hafaz\" meaning to guard. The subjective form is \"hafiz\" meaning a person who guards and \"hafizah\" meaning she who guards (feminine). \"Hafizat\" is plural of \"hafizah\" (both being feminine). It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes.\n\nAnd those whose rebellion (\"nushûz\") is feared. It is advised\n1: to admonish them\n2: to leave them alone in beds\n3: to beat them\n\n\nThe first response to \"nushuz\" is \"wā'z\" (‘وَعَظ’), meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour. There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation.\n\nAccording to tafsir ibn kathir, a well known commentary of Quran. He describes in his exegesis.\n\nShould the \"nushuz\" continue, the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife. Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action.\n\nAccording to tafsir ibn Kathir.\n\nThe term \"iḍribūhunna\" (usually translated, 'beat them') in 4:34 comes from the root \"ḍaraba\" (Arabic: ضرب). The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean: to hit, to travel the earth, to set up, to condemn and to give examples. Thus scholars interpret \"iḍribūhunna\" in different ways. Whereas many interpret it to mean \"to strike\", others hold that the term means \"to separate\". Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce. In the context of this verse, iḍribūhunna has also been interpreted to mean \"go to bed with them\", the Arabic root word \"daraba\" being taken from the prosaic example \"the stud-camel covered the she-camel\".\n\nThe term \"daraba\" is translated by Yusuf Ali as \"beat,\" but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Qur'an to convey different meanings. The phrase, \"Daraba Allah mathalan\" translates to, \"Allah \"gives\" or \"sets\" an example.\" The use of this word might be compared to the way \"to strike\" is used in English, which can mean, \"to strike a pose,\" or \"to strike a bargain,\" not just referring to the physical act of hitting something. The use of \"daraba\" is also intentional, because a different Arabic word exists, \"daraba\" which is translated to, \"to strike repeatedly or intensely.\"\n\nMuslim scholars who permit hitting, emphasize that it must not be harsh, but rather light. Muslim men are never to hit their spouse's face, nor to hit them in such a way as would leave marks on their body. Scholars suggest that the response administered should be in proportion to the fault committed. Traditionally the idea of beating was \"with a toothbrush\" or \"with a folded handkerchief.\" Jonathan A.C. Brown resumes the situation:If a wife exhibited egregious disobedience (nushuz) such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior, leaving the house against the husband's will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex (without medical grounds), the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette. If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect, any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.Many jurists interpret \"iḍribūhunna\" as \"more or less symbolic.\" Others, however, argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an \"energetic demonstration\" of the love of the husband. But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife.\n\nThe 2007 translation \"The Sublime Quran\" by Laleh Bakhtiar translates \"iḍribūhunna\" not as 'beat them' but as 'go away from them'. The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shari‘ah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context. The Prophet never beat his wives, and his example from the Sunnah informs the interpretation of this verse. This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses, such as 4:101 which contains word \"darabtum\" (derivation from \"daraba\"), demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word \"daraba\" to have meaning 'going' or 'moving'.\n\nThe Islamic scholar Tahir-ul-Qadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran \"Irfan-ul-Quran\": \"(...)and (if they still do not improve) turn away from them, striking a temporary parting.(...)\". This translation is further supported by the fact that the word \"darabtum\" is used in the same chapter (specifically, in ), which means to \"go abroad\" in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word (\"\"daraba\") as \"idribuhunna\"\" in 4:34.\n\nThe book \"Woman in the Shade of Islam\" by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman al-Sheha stated that a man may \"beat\" his wife only if it occurs without \"hurting, breaking a bone, leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face, at any cost.\"\n\nA widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that, as a last resort, men can \"scourge\" their wives.\n\nSome jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Qur'an, it is still discountenanced.\n\nIn his book \"\", University of Southern California scholar Reza Aslan, stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary \"has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men.\"\n\nThe Islamic prophet Mohammed himself, according to Islamic tradition, never once struck a woman in argument. This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text.\n\nMuslim feminist writer Asra Q. Nomani has argued, Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book, <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Inside the Gender Jihad: Women's Reform in Islam<nowiki>\"</nowiki>:\n\nIbn Ishaq has said that Muhammad in his The Farewell Sermon said that:\n\nNada Ibrahim of the University of South Australia states that three words—\"qawwamuna\", \"nushuzahunna\", and \"wadribuhunna\"—are mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives. She explains that in particular, English language Qur'an commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word \"wadribuhunna\" and that \"A clear disagreement exists among English-language Qur’an commentators on how best to translate this word. All translations give an explicit negative connotation, and – when read out of context – further exacerbates any misunderstanding.\"\n\nIn quran’s Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following:\nIn this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them..\n\nIbn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says\n\nIt means that God is exalted.\nIt means that God is great.\n\n\n\n"}

He began his career creating figurative art influenced by expressionism. He has worked in several media, including acrylic and oil on canvas, photography, and video. In the 1990s he and other Guatemalan artists such as Regina José Galindo began creating art \"actions\" or live art, a combination of street art, performance art, minimalism, and conceptual art. A-1 53167 is the code name (his Guatemalan ID card number) that Aníbal López has used since 1997 to sign many of his art actions as a way to show how he questions codes of information regarding identity.The effect is to erase an ethnic-specific sense of belonging and perhaps to resist the impulse of art consumers to categorize him in preconceived categories such as indigenous, Mayan, or Guatemalan.\n\nAníbal López, or A-1 53167, creates street interventions that combine the rationalist detachment of conceptual art with the political bravado of Latin American guerrilla fighters. In \"El Préstamo\" (\"The Loan\"), a gun-toting A-1 53167 staged an armed robbery by attacking an unwitting passer-by. The stolen money was used to fund an exhibition at the \"Contexto\" art space, thus transforming the victim into an art sponsor and the spectator into an accomplice in the event.\n\nIn 2001 at the 49th Venice Biennale, he exhibited photographs from a 2000 action in which he scattered the contents of ten large bags of coal across the main boulevard in the center of Guatemala City where a military parade was to take place. The action was intended to remind the military of the crimes and massacres it committed against the country's citizens during the 36-year civil war when more than 200 000 civilians were killed - mostly members of the indigenous Maya Indian community. The military committed human rights abuses including some acts that have been judged to be genocide, as documented by Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú and others. In an interview with Biennale organizers, the artist stated, \"There is a close relationship namely, between the coal, the massacres, and the military, because this material can always be found in the mass graves. In most cases, houses and corpses are burned. I knew that the coal would be cleared away before the parade. I scattered it at about two o'clock in the morning, and at seven o'clock it had already been removed. But there were still traces left. I wanted the military to walk over these traces, and to be able to take photos of the marching army. Since I work with signs that have somehow established themselves, in this case the coal that points to the massacres and the mass graves, I refer with the action to existing problems, without becoming too obvious. It wasn't my intention for the spectators to perceive these signs, but rather that the military itself should notice them.\"\n\nAt the opening of his Berlin exhibition in 2004, he presented another action, this time aimed at the art world. He arranged for six security guards to prevent the public from any contact with the art, the objects, and other people, all under a prohibition sign that said \"Do it right\".\n\nFor \"One Ton Of Books Dumped On Reform Avenue,\" a dump truck stopped in the middle of Guatemala City's Avenida La Reforma, a major artery, dumped its load of used books, and drove away. Local traffic was disrupted and had to maneuver around the pile of seeming rubbish. Pedestrians joined the fracas, moving into the boulevard to pick through the abandoned books, taking anything that interested them. The action was memorialized in a video.\n\nIn 2007, Lopez paid smugglers to transport empty boxes into Brazil, resulting in the action, \"Sculpture Composed of 500 Boxes of Contraband Transported from Paraguay to Brazil,\" also memorialized in a video.\n\nIn \"Roll of 120m x 4m Black Plastic Hanging From The Incienso Bridge\" (2003), Lopez attached a long ribbon of plastic to a bridge, where it then floated in the air above a valley.\n\nHe is represented by Prometeogallery, Milan, Italy, and The 9.99 Gallery, Guatemala City.\n\nAníbal López's awards include:\n\nSince 1996 he has held several solo and group exhibitions in Guatemala, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Costa Rica and the United States.

In his book \"Disturbing the Universe\" (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, self-replicating automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to John von Neumann, based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled \"The General and Logical Theory of Automata\". Dyson expanded on von Neumann's automata theories and added a biological component to them.\n\nAstrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram spacecraft unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, artificial intelligence and modern microelectronics—a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an ion drive engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by bombardier beetles. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.\n\nThe term \"astrochicken\" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding von Neumann-inspired automata. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in Adelaide, Australia on the subject of space exploration with biotechnology. An audience member called out \"Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken.\" and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.\n\nToday, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist Rodney Brooks has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of NASA for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the Mars Pathfinder mission. Physicist and noted author Michio Kaku wrote in his work \"Hyperspace\", \"Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets\".\n\nAs a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the Dyson sphere and the Dyson tree, have become popular in the scientific and science fiction communities. The more whimsically named \"Astrochicken\" has not achieved this same level of fame.\n\n"}
{"id": "6928882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6928882", "title": "Biological hydrogen production (algae)", "text": "Biological hydrogen production (algae)\n\nThe biological hydrogen production with algae is a method of photobiological water splitting which is done in a closed photobioreactor based on the production of hydrogen as a solar fuel by algae. Algae produce hydrogen under certain conditions. In 2000 it was discovered that if \"C. reinhardtii\" algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.\n\nPhotosynthesis in cyanobacteria and green algae splits water into hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons are transported over ferredoxins. Fe-Fe-hydrogenases (enzymes) combine them into hydrogen gas. In \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" Photosystem II produces in direct conversion of sunlight 80% of the electrons that end up in the hydrogen gas. Light-harvesting complex photosystem II light-harvesting protein LHCBM9 promotes efficient light energy dissipation. The Fe-Fe-hydrogenases\nneed an anaerobic environment as they are inactivated by oxygen. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to examine metabolic pathways.\n\nThe chlorophyll (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture.\n\nIn 1939 Hans Gaffron observed that the algae he was studying, \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\" (a green-algae), would sometimes switch from the production of oxygen to the production of hydrogen. He never discovered the cause of this change and for many years other scientists failed in their attempts to discover it. In the late 1990s, Anastasios Melis discovered that if the algae culture medium is deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis), to the production of hydrogen. He found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase, but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis found that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted its internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen. \"Chlamydomonas moewusii\" is also a good strain for the production of hydrogen.\n\nIt would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone. This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.\n\n\nAttempts are in progress to solve these problems via bioengineering.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "216216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216216", "title": "Conservation biology", "text": "Conservation biology\n\nConservation biology is the management of nature and of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions. It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences, and the practice of natural resource management.\n\nThe conservation ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology.\n\nThe term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of \"The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology\" held at the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and Michael E. Soulé with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including Kurt Benirschke, Sir Otto Frankel, Thomas Lovejoy, and Jared Diamond. The meeting was prompted by the concern over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic diversity within species. The conference and proceedings that resulted sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other. Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity (biodiversity) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy. The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, conservation behavior and conservation physiology. It stimulated further development of conservation genetics which Otto Frankel had originated first but is now often considered a subdiscipline as well.\n\nThe rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a \"Discipline with a deadline\". Conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the population ecology (dispersal, migration, demographics, effective population size, inbreeding depression, and minimum population viability) of rare or endangered species. Conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance, loss, and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic, population, species, and ecosystem diversity. The concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50% of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years, which has contributed to poverty, starvation, and will reset the course of evolution on this planet.\n\nConservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss, species extinctions, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the current biodiversity crisis based on morals, ethics, and scientific reason. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.\n\nConscious efforts to conserve and protect \"global\" biodiversity are a recent phenomenon. Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community. This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the \"Tragedy of the Commons\".\n\nFrom this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict. For example, the Alaskan Tlingit peoples and the Haida of the Pacific Northwest had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of sockeye salmon. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed. There are numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules, rituals, and organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management.\n\nThe Mauryan emperor Ashoka around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.\n\nConservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the Tao, Shinto, Hindu, Islamic and Buddhist traditions. In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture land degradation: \"What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left.\" In the bible, through Moses, God commanded to let the land rest from cultivation every seventh year. Before the 18th century, however, much of European culture considered it a pagan view to admire nature. Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised. However, as early as AD 680 a wildlife sanctuary was founded on the Farne Islands by St Cuthbert in response to his religious beliefs.\n\nNatural history was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in Europe and North America. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in Germany, 250 in Great Britain, 250 in the United States, and 300 in France. Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries.\n\nBefore Charles Darwin set sail on HMS \"Beagle\", most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged. George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences. Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors. The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.\n\nBy the early 19th century biogeography was ignited through the efforts of Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Lyell and Charles Darwin. The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors. Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and conservation organizations, their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.\n\nThe modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century Enlightenment period particularly in England and Scotland. A number of thinkers, among them notably Lord Monboddo, described the importance of \"preserving nature\"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in Christian theology.\n\nScientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of British India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.\n\nThe Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to other colonies, as well the United States, where Yellowstone National Park was opened in 1872 as the world's first national park.\n\nThe term \"conservation\" came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as timber, fish, game, topsoil, pastureland, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of forests (forestry), wildlife (wildlife refuge), parkland, wilderness, and watersheds. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869 was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world after extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds and the respected ornithologist Alfred Newton. Newton was also instrumental in the passage of the first Game laws from 1872, which protected animals during their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to extinction.\n\nOne of the first conservation societies was the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded in 1889 in Manchester as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. Originally known as \"the Plumage League\", the group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon, and formed the RSPB. The National Trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\"\n\nIn the United States, the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 gave the President power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. John Muir founded the Sierra Club in 1892, and the New York Zoological Society was set up in 1895. A series of national forests and preserves were established by Theodore Roosevelt from 1901 to 1909. The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in Dinosaur National Monument in 1959.\n\nIn the 20th century, Canadian civil servants, including Charles Gordon Hewitt and James Harkin spearheaded the movement toward wildlife conservation.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in big cat conservation in South America led by the New York Zoological Society. In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., Carl E. Akeley, Archie Carr and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era. Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the Virunga Mountains and observed the mountain gorilla in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading Albert I of Belgium to act in defense of the mountain gorilla and establish Albert National Park (since renamed Virunga National Park) in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nBy the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the Endangered Species Act along with the Species at Risk Act (SARA) of Canada, Biodiversity Action Plans developed in Australia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act (1966) and National Environmental Policy Act (1970), which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.\n\nIn 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the urban conservation movement. A local organization was established in Birmingham, UK, a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a grassroots movement, its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The Society for Conservation Biology originated in 1985.\n\nBy 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the Convention on Biological Diversity; subsequently many countries began programmes of Biodiversity Action Plans to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management and the Society for the Environment.\n\nSince 2000, the concept of landscape scale conservation has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.\n\nEcology has clarified the workings of the biosphere; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The burgeoning human population and associated agriculture, industry, and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.\n\nExtinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply statistical measures of fossil records, rates of habitat loss, and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy to obtain such estimates. \"The Theory of Island Biogeography\" is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current background extinction rate is estimated to be one species every few years.\n\nThe measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000) to how many have received a species binomial (estimated range: 1.5-8 million). Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence. From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of vertebrates, 5% of invertebrates and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as endangered or threatened. Better knowledge is being constructed by The Plant List for actual numbers of species.\n\nSystematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:\n\n\nConservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for grant proposals or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of Geographic Information Systems to assist in the decision making process.\n\nConservation physiology was defined by Steven J. Cooke and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.' Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.\n\nThe Society for Conservation Biology is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as philosophy, law, economics, humanities, arts, anthropology, and education. Within biology, conservation genetics and evolution are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.\n\nIs conservation biology an objective science when biologists advocate for an inherent value in nature? Do conservationists introduce bias when they support policies using qualitative description, such as habitat \"degradation\", or \"healthy\" ecosystems? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of science, reason, logic, and values in their conservation management plans. This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.\n\nThere is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large. The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.\n\nConservation may be classified as either in-situ conservation, which is protecting an endangered species in its natural habitat, or ex-situ conservation, which occurs outside the natural habitat. In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.\n\nAlso, non-interference may be used, which is termed a preservationist method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans. In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.\n\nConservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.\n\nA conservationist may be inspired by the \"resource conservation ethic\", which seeks to identify what measures will deliver \"the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time.\" In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an intrinsic value that is independent of anthropocentric usefulness or utilitarianism. Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. Aldo Leopold was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List. The IUCN Red List serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity. More than the dramatic rates of species loss, however, conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on rare, endemic or endangered species. Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and ecosystem diversity. Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the conservation status of species is employed extensively in conservation management, some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.\n\nWhile most in the community of conservation science \"stress the importance\" of sustaining biodiversity, there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving \"biodiversity hotspots\", some scientists (e.g) and conservation organizations, such as the Nature Conservancy, argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in \"biodiversity coldspots\". The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.\n\nBiodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, \"[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth.\"\n\nThose arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where biomass, not biodiversity, reigns supreme. It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the endemic species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot. Moreover, measures show that maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any better than targeting randomly chosen regions. Population level biodiversity (i.e. coldspots) are disappearing at a rate that is ten times that at the species level. The level of importance in addressing biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism. A hotspot priority approach would not invest so heavily in places such as steppes, the Serengeti, the Arctic, or taiga. These areas contribute a great abundance of population (not species) level biodiversity and ecosystem services, including cultural value and planetary nutrient cycling.\n\nThose in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections. The IUCN Red List categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale. This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass. Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary adaptability, and biomass. Both sides agree, however, that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature; the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective way.\n\nConservation biologists have started to collaborate with leading global economists to determine how to measure the wealth and services of nature and to make these values apparent in global market transactions. This system of accounting is called \"natural capital\" and would, for example, register the value of an ecosystem before it is cleared to make way for development. The WWF publishes its \"Living Planet Report\" and provides a global index of biodiversity by monitoring approximately 5,000 populations in 1,686 species of vertebrate (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians) and report on the trends in much the same way that the stock market is tracked.\n\nThis method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has been endorsed by the G8+5 leaders and the European Commission. Nature sustains many ecosystem services that benefit humanity. Many of the Earth's ecosystem services are public goods without a market and therefore no price or value. When the \"stock market\" registers a financial crisis, traders on Wall Street are not in the business of trading stocks for much of the planet's living natural capital stored in ecosystems. There is no natural stock market with investment portfolios into sea horses, amphibians, insects, and other creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable to society. The ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet's ecosystems by about 30 percent, which is the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have registered decline from 1970 through 2005.\n\nThe inherent natural economy plays an essential role in sustaining humanity, including the regulation of global atmospheric chemistry, pollinating crops, pest control, cycling soil nutrients, purifying our water supply, supplying medicines and health benefits, and unquantifiable quality of life improvements. There is a relationship, a correlation, between markets and natural capital, and social income inequity and biodiversity loss. This means that there are greater rates of biodiversity loss in places where the inequity of wealth is greatest\n\nAlthough a direct market comparison of natural capital is likely insufficient in terms of human value, one measure of ecosystem services suggests the contribution amounts to trillions of dollars yearly. For example, one segment of North American forests has been assigned an annual value of 250 billion dollars; as another example, honey-bee pollination is estimated to provide between 10 and 18 billion dollars of value yearly. The value of ecosystem services on one New Zealand island has been imputed to be as great as the GDP of that region. This planetary wealth is being lost at an incredible rate as the demands of human society is exceeding the bio-regenerative capacity of the Earth. While biodiversity and ecosystems are resilient, the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many ecosystem functions through technological innovation.\n\nSome species, called a \"keystone species\" form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem. The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species. Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem. The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (\"Hydrodamalis gigas\") through its interaction with sea otters, sea urchins, and kelp. Kelp beds grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the food chain. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to overhunting, sea urchin populations grazed unrestricted on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise. The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley, who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.\n\nAn \"indicator species\" has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to wetlands, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a \"miner's canary\". Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities. Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest silviculture treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a pesticide may impart on the health of an ecosystem.\n\nGovernment regulators, consultants, or NGOs regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective. It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997).\n\nAn example of an \"umbrella species\" is the monarch butterfly, because of its lengthy migrations and aesthetic value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as \"flagship species\", which are species, such as the giant panda, the blue whale, the tiger, the mountain gorilla and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures. Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern. \n\nConservation biologists study trends and process from the paleontological past to the ecological present as they gain an understanding of the context related to species extinction. It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include: the Ordovician (440 mya), Devonian (370 mya), Permian–Triassic (245 mya), Triassic–Jurassic (200 mya), and Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (66 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost; that is to say the rates of deforestation, reef destruction, wetland draining and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species. The latest \"Living Planet Report\" by the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that we have exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet, requiring 1.6 Earths to support the demands placed on our natural resources.\n\nConservation biologists are dealing with and have published evidence from all corners of the planet indicating that humanity may be causing the sixth and fastest planetary extinction event. It has been suggested that we are living in an era of unprecedented numbers of species extinctions, also known as the Holocene extinction event. The global extinction rate may be approximately 1,000 times higher than the natural background extinction rate. It is estimated that two-thirds of all mammal genera and one-half of all mammal species weighing at least have gone extinct in the last 50,000 years. The Global Amphibian Assessment reports that amphibians are declining on a global scale faster than any other vertebrate group, with over 32% of all surviving species being threatened with extinction. The surviving populations are in continual decline in 43% of those that are threatened. Since the mid-1980s the actual rates of extinction have exceeded 211 times rates measured from the fossil record. However, \"The current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate for amphibians.\" The global extinction trend occurs in every major vertebrate group that is being monitored. For example, 23% of all mammals and 12% of all birds are Red Listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), meaning they too are threatened with extinction. Even though extinction is natural, the decline in species is happening at such an incredible rate that evolution can simply not match, therefore, leading to the greatest continual mass extinction on Earth. Humans have dominated the planet and our high consumption of resources, along with the pollution generated is affecting the environments in which other species live. There are a wide variety of species that humans are working to protect such as the Hawaiian Crow and the Whooping Crane of Texas. People can also take action on preserving species by advocating and voting for global and national policies that improve climate, under the concepts of climate mitigation and climate restoration. The Earth's oceans especially require attention, as climate change has altered pH levels making it inhabitable for organisms with shells, that are dissolving as a result.\n\nGlobal assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic \"bleaching\" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. \"Coral bleaching\" is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses, including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity, causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals. Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years. The loss of coral reefs, which are predicted to go extinct in the next century, threatens the balance of global biodiversity, will have huge economic impacts, and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of people. Conservation biology plays an important role in international agreements covering the world's oceans (and other issues pertaining to biodiversity).\n\nThe oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic natural resources. A concern is that the majority of all marine species will not be able to evolve or acclimate in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.\n\nThe prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when \"[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean\" are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving multi-cellular organisms with only microbes left to dominate marine ecosystems.\n\nSerious concerns also being raised about taxonomic groups that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates. These include fungal (including lichen-forming species), invertebrate (particularly insect) and plant communities where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented. Conservation of fungi and conservation of insects, in particular, are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology. As mycorrhizal symbionts, and as decomposers and recyclers, fungi are essential for sustainability of forests. The value of insects in the biosphere is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of species richness. The greatest bulk of biomass on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.\n\nOne area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing honey bees (\"Apis mellifera\"). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world. The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or colony collapse disorder (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in 16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 beekeepers across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. Pests, pesticides, and global warming are all being considered as possible causes.\n\nAnother highlight that links conservation biology to insects, forests, and climate change is the mountain pine beetle (\"Dendroctonus ponderosae\") epidemic of British Columbia, Canada, which has infested of forested land since 1999. An action plan has been prepared by the Government of British Columbia to address this problem.\n\nA large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.\n\nToday, many threats to Biodiversity exist. An acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day H.I.P.P.O stands for Habitat Loss, Invasive Species, Pollution, Human Population, and Overharvesting. The primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction (such as deforestation, agricultural expansion, urban development), and overexploitation (such as wildlife trade). Habitat fragmentation also poses challenges, because the global network of protected areas only covers 11.5% of the Earth's surface. A significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale. Considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth, the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology.\n\nHowever, human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere. With conservation management and planning for biodiversity at all levels, from genes to ecosystems, there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature. Even with the current threats to biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start anew.\n\nMany of the threats to biodiversity, including disease and climate change, are reaching inside borders of protected areas, leaving them 'not-so protected' (e.g. Yellowstone National Park). Climate change, for example, is often cited as a serious threat in this regard, because there is a feedback loop between species extinction and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Ecosystems store and cycle large amounts of carbon which regulates global conditions. In present day, there have been major climate shifts with temperature changes making survival of some species difficult. The effects of global warming add a catastrophic threat toward a mass extinction of global biological diversity. Conservationists have claimed that not all the species can be saved, and they have to decide which their efforts should be used to protect. This concept is known as the Conservation Triage. The extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent of all species by 2050, or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years. The current extinction rate is 100-100,000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In inculcating a turn of mind that would lead to a state of serenity untrammeled by distracting material appetites and feverish emotional connections, which the Greek philosophers called \"ataraxia\", it drew upon the assumptions of Stoicism and a neoplatonism that was distrustful of deceptive and spurious appearances. In the familiar rhetorical polarity in Hellenic philosophy between the active and the contemplative life, which Christians, who expressly rejected \"the World, the Flesh and the Devil\", might exemplify as the way of Martha and the way of Mary, \"contemptus mundi\" assumed that only the contemplative life was of lasting value and the world an empty shell, a vanity.\n\nIn the classical canon, Cicero's \"Tusculanae Disputationes\", essays on achieving Stoic stability of emotions, with rhetorical subjects such as \"Contempt of death\", was taken up definitively by Boethius in his \"Consolations of Philosophy\", during the troubled closing phase of Late Antiquity. The Latin tradition of dispraise of the public world adapted by Christian moralists, focused especially on the fickleness of Fortune, and the evils exposed in the Latin satire became a mainstay of Christian penitential literature.\n\nAmong early Christians, Eucherius of Lyon, an aristocratic and high-ranking ecclesiastic in the fifth-century Christian Church of Gaul, wrote to his kinsman a widely read letter \"de contemptu mundi\", an expression of the despair for the present and future of the world in its last throes. Contempt for the world provided intellectual underpinnings for the retreat into monasticism: when Saint Florentina, of the prominent Christian family of Hispania, founded her convent, her rule written by her brother Leander of Seville explicitly cited contempt for the world: \"Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem\".\n\nThe medieval \"trope\" of \"contemptus mundi\", drawing upon these converging traditions, pagan philosophy and Christian ascetic theology, was fundamental to a medieval education. A classic Christian expression is Bernard of Cluny's bitter 12th-century satire \"De contemptu mundi\", founded in a deep sense of the transitory nature of secular joys and the abiding permanency of the spiritual life. His text made one of the \"Auctores octo morales\", the \"eight moral authors\" that formed the central texts of medieval pedagogy.\n\nIn the early 12th century, when Adelard of Bath (c. 1080 - 1152) allegorized two contrasting figures to dispute \"De eodem et diverso\"; they were \"Philosophia\" and \"Philocosmia\", \"love of wisdom\" and the \"love of the world\". Adelard's contemporary, Henry of Huntington, in the dedicatory letter to his \"Historia Anglorum\" referred in passing to \"those who taught the contempt of the world in schools\". \n\nAn aspect of contempt for this world reflects upon the ephemerality of all life, expressed in the literary rhetorical question of \"ubi sunt\". Even as worldly a pope as Innocent III could write an essay \"On the Misery of the Human Condition\", \"De miseria humanae conditionis\", which Geoffrey Chaucer is reputed to have rendered in English, in a translation now lost. The theme had political ramifications within the Roman Church, as it was inextricably bound up with questions of apostolic poverty which was roundly condemned, in the instance of the Humiliati, as heretical.\n\nThe waning of the dominant attitude of \"contemptus mundi\" that had informed elite culture, a development that gathered impetus during the second half of the 14th century, was a precursor to the emergence of the modern secular ethos, encouraging men to study material things with greater lucidity than before, as Georges Duby has observed, noting the turn taken in painting and sculpture toward the realistic delineation of aspects of material life.\n\nThe theme of \"contemptus mundi\" continued to inform European poetry into the Early Modern period. \"Contemptus mundi\" is a running theme in the poetry of William Drummond of Hawthornden, and Burton's \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\" and the devotional verse of Jeremy Taylor would serve as further examples. The recurrence of bubonic plague offered a concrete visitation of the frailty of this life for devotional texts, as early as John Donne.\n\nIn modern times \"contemptus mundi\" has been criticized as a \"pastoral of fear\" by the historian Jean Delumeau, and M. B. Pranger found the \"trope\" \"Speaking of God after Auschwitz\" to function as a \"modern form of \"contemptus mundi\"\".\n"}
{"id": "232428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232428", "title": "Cruelty", "text": "Cruelty\n\nCruelty is indifference to suffering or pleasure in inflicting suffering. Sadism can also be related to this form of action or concept. Cruel ways of inflicting suffering may involve violence, but affirmative violence is not necessary for an act to be cruel. For example, if a person is drowning and begging for help and another person is able to help with no cost or risk, but is merely watching with disinterest or perhaps mischievous amusement, that person is being cruel—rather than violent.\n\nGeorge Eliot stated that \"cruelty, like every other vice, requires no motive outside itself; it only requires opportunity.\" Bertrand Russell stated that \"the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists. That is why they invented Hell.\" Gilbert K. Chesterton stated that \"cruelty is, perhaps, the worst kind of sin. Intellectual cruelty is certainly the worst kind of cruelty.\"\n\nThe word has metaphorical uses, for example \"The cliffs remained cruel.\" (i.e. unclimbable when they desperately needed to be climbed) in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe term \"cruelty\" is often used in law and criminology with regard to the treatment of animals, children, spouses, and prisoners. When cruelty to animals is discussed, it often refers to \"unnecessary suffering.\" In criminal law, it refers to punishment, torture, victimization, draconian measures, and cruel and unusual punishment. In divorce cases, many jurisdictions permit a cause of action for cruel and inhumane treatment.\n\nIn law, cruelty is \"the infliction of physical or mental distress, especially when considered a determinant in granting a divorce.\"\n\nThe term comes from Middle English, via the Old French term \"crualte\", which is based on Latin \"crudelitas\", from \"crudelis\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9087", "title": "Dynamical system", "text": "Dynamical system\n\nIn mathematics, a dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.\n\nAt any given time, a dynamical system has a state given by a tuple of real numbers (a vector) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate state space (a geometrical manifold). The \"evolution rule\" of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is deterministic, that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state. However, some systems are stochastic, in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.\n\nIn physics, a dynamical system is described as a \"particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives.\" In order to make a prediction about the system’s future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.\n\nThe study of dynamical systems is the focus of dynamical systems theory, which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, economics, and medicine. Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of chaos theory, logistic map dynamics, bifurcation theory, the self-assembly process, and the edge of chaos concept.\n\nThe concept of a dynamical system has its origins in Newtonian mechanics. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future. (The relation is either a differential equation, difference equation or other time scale.) To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times—each advancing time a small step. The iteration procedure is referred to as \"solving the system\" or \"integrating the system\". If the system can be solved, given an initial point it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a \"trajectory\" or \"orbit\".\n\nBefore the advent of computers, finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems. Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.\n\nFor simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories. The difficulties arise because:\n\nMany people regard Henri Poincaré as the founder of dynamical systems. Poincaré published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892–1899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.\n\nAleksandr Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamic system.\n\nIn 1913, George David Birkhoff proved Poincaré's \"Last Geometric Theorem\", a special case of the three-body problem, a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his \"Dynamical Systems\"Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the ergodic theorem. Combining insights from physics on the ergodic hypothesis with measure theory, this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.\n\nStephen Smale made significant advances as well. His first contribution is the Smale horseshoe that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.\n\nOleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky developed Sharkovsky's theorem on the periods of discrete dynamical systems in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.\n\nA dynamical system is a manifold \"M\" called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions Φ that for any element of \"t\" ∈ \"T\", the time, map a point of the phase space back into the phase space. The notion of smoothness changes with applications and the type of manifold. There are several choices for the set \"T\". When \"T\" is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called a \"flow\"; and if \"T\" is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a \"semi-flow\". When \"T\" is taken to be the integers, it is a \"cascade\" or a \"map\"; and the restriction to the non-negative integers is a \"semi-cascade\".\n\nThe evolution function Φ is often the solution of a \"differential equation of motion\"\n\nThe equation gives the time derivative, represented by the dot, of a trajectory \"x\"(\"t\") on the phase space starting at some point \"x\". The vector field \"v\"(\"x\") is a smooth function that at every point of the phase space \"M\" provides the velocity vector of the dynamical system at that point. (These vectors are not vectors in the phase space \"M\", but in the tangent space \"TM\" of the point \"x\".) Given a smooth Φ, an autonomous vector field can be derived from it.\n\nThere is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for time dependence in \"v\"(\"x\") because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions. Other types of differential equations can be used to define the evolution rule:\n\nis an example of an equation that arises from the modeling of mechanical systems with complicated constraints.\n\nThe differential equations determining the evolution function Φ are often ordinary differential equations; in this case the phase space \"M\" is a finite dimensional manifold. Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds—those that are locally Banach spaces—in which case the differential equations are partial differential equations. In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity.\n\nLinear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified. In a linear system the phase space is the \"N\"-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with \"N\" numbers. The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a superposition principle: if \"u\"(\"t\") and \"w\"(\"t\") satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will \"u\"(\"t\") + \"w\"(\"t\").\n\nFor a flow, the vector field Φ(\"x\") is an affine function of the position in the phase space, that is,\nwith \"A\" a matrix, \"b\" a vector of numbers and \"x\" the position vector. The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).\nThe case \"b\" ≠ 0 with \"A\" = 0 is just a straight line in the direction of \"b\":\n\nWhen \"b\" is zero and \"A\" ≠ 0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if \"x\" = 0, then the orbit remains there.\nFor other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the exponential of a matrix: for an initial point \"x\",\n\nWhen \"b\" = 0, the eigenvalues of \"A\" determine the structure of the phase space. From the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of \"A\" it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.\n\nThe distance between two different initial conditions in the case \"A\" ≠ 0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast. Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for chaotic behavior.\n\nA discrete-time, affine dynamical system has the form of a matrix difference equation:\nwith \"A\" a matrix and \"b\" a vector. As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates \"x\" → \"x\" + (1 − \"A\")\"b\" removes the term \"b\" from the equation. In the new coordinate system, the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system \"A\"\"x\".\nThe solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space. The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.\n\nAs in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \"A\" determine the structure of phase space. For example, if \"u\" is an eigenvector of \"A\", with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along \"α\" \"u\", with \"α\" ∈ R, is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.\n\nThere are also many other discrete dynamical systems.\n\nThe qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative): a \"singular point\" of the vector field (a point where \"v\"(\"x\") = 0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a \"periodic orbit\" is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop. It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.\n\nA flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple. If \"y\" is a point where the vector field \"v\"(\"y\") ≠ 0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around \"y\" where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude. This is known as the rectification theorem.\n\nThe \"rectification theorem\" says that away from singular points the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space \"M\" the dynamical system is \"integrable\". In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. There may be singular points in the vector field (where \"v\"(\"x\") = 0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.\n\nIn general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used. Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point \"x\" in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to \"v\"(\"x\"). These points are a Poincaré section \"S\"(\"γ\", \"x\"), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the Poincaré map \"F\" : \"S\" → \"S\", for points starting in \"S\" and returning to \"S\". Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes \"x\".\n\nThe intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map \"F\". By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at \"x\" = 0. The Taylor series of the map is \"F\"(\"x\") = \"J\" · \"x\" + O(\"x\"), so a change of coordinates \"h\" can only be expected to simplify \"F\" to its linear part\n\nThis is known as the conjugation equation. Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems. Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition. If \"λ\", ..., \"λ\" are the eigenvalues of \"J\" they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others. As terms of the form \"λ\" – ∑ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function \"h\", the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.\n\nThe results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of \"J\" and the degree of smoothness required from \"h\". As \"J\" does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers. When the eigenvalues of \"J\" are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point \"x\" of \"F\" is called \"hyperbolic\" and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called \"elliptic\".\n\nIn the hyperbolic case, the Hartman–Grobman theorem gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map \"J\" · \"x\". The hyperbolic case is also \"structurally stable\". Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of \"J\" in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.\n\nThe Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.\n\nWhen the evolution map Φ (or the vector field it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the phase space until a special value \"μ\" is reached. At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.\n\nBifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a fixed point, a periodic orbit, or an invariant torus) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter \"μ\". At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures. By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.\n\nThe bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point \"x\" of a system family \"F\" can be characterized by the eigenvalues of the first derivative of the system \"DF\"(\"x\") computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of \"DF\" on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on Bifurcation theory.\n\nSome bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the Ruelle–Takens scenario describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a strange attractor. In another example, Feigenbaum period-doubling describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of period-doubling bifurcations.\n\nIn many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant. This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position) × (momentum). The flow takes points of a subset \"A\" into the points Φ(\"A\") and invariance of the phase space means that\nIn the Hamiltonian formalism, given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow. The volume is said to be computed by the Liouville measure.\n\nIn a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible. The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.\n\nFor systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the recurrence theorem: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let \"F\" be a phase space volume-preserving map and \"A\" a subset of the phase space. Then almost every point of \"A\" returns to \"A\" infinitely often. The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by Zermelo to object to Boltzmann's derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.\n\nOne of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the ergodic hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region \"A\" is vol(\"A\")/vol(Ω).\n\nThe ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of statistical mechanics and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems. Koopman approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of functional analysis. An observable \"a\" is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height). The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ. This introduces an operator \"U\", the transfer operator,\n\nBy studying the spectral properties of the linear operator \"U\" it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of Φ. In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving \"U\".\n\nThe Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in equilibrium statistical mechanics. An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the Boltzmann factor exp(−β\"H\"). This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. SRB measures replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.\n\nSimple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called \"chaos\". Hyperbolic systems are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems. In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the \"stable manifold\") and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the \"unstable manifold\").\n\nThis branch of mathematics deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like \"Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible attractors?\" or \"Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?\"\n\nNote that the chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. Meteorology has been known for years to involve complex—even chaotic—behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The logistic map is only a second-degree polynomial; the horseshoe map is piecewise linear.\n\nA dynamical system is the tuple formula_10, with formula_11 a manifold (locally a Banach space or Euclidean space), formula_12 the domain for time (non-negative reals, the integers, ...) and \"f\" an evolution rule \"t\" → \"f\" (with formula_13) such that \"f\" is a diffeomorphism of the manifold to itself. So, f is a mapping of the time-domain formula_14 into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, \"f\"(\"t\") is a diffeomorphism, for every time \"t\" in the domain formula_14 .\n\nA dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a sigma-algebra, the quadruplet (\"X\", Σ, μ, τ). Here, \"X\" is a set, and Σ is a sigma-algebra on \"X\", so that the pair (\"X\", Σ) is a measurable space. μ is a finite measure on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (\"X\", Σ, μ) is a probability space. A map τ: \"X\" → \"X\" is said to be Σ-measurable if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has formula_16. A map τ is said to preserve the measure if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has formula_17. Combining the above, a map τ is said to be a measure-preserving transformation of \"X\" , if it is a map from \"X\" to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (\"X\", Σ, μ, τ), for such a τ, is then defined to be a dynamical system.\n\nThe map τ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the iterates formula_18 for integer \"n\" are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map τ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.\n\nDynamical systems are defined over a single independent variable, usually thought of as time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple independent variables and are therefore called multidimensional systems. Such systems are useful for modeling, for example, image processing.\n\nWorks providing a broad coverage:\n\nIntroductory texts with a unique perspective:\n\nTextbooks\n\nPopularizations:\n\n\n\n"}

In the case of elastic strain this is observed as a distortion of the crystal lattice, in the case of plastic strain this is observed by the presence of dislocations –the displacement of part of the crystal lattice. Such strain effects can result in unwanted cracking of the material, as is the case with residual plastic strain. In other cases deliberate introduction of plastic strain results in a strengthening of the material and other performance enhancing behaviors, for example in the manufacture of semi-conductors and solar cells.\n\nAs an illustration, if you hang a weight on a spring it extends in direct proportion to the load. That is the same effect that occurs in the elastic deformation part of the standard tensile test.\n\nThis is normally written as: applied stress = Young’s modulus * strain\n\nThat is: σ = Y * e\n\nCommonly known as: Hooke’s Law.\n\nWhere stress is a force ( a vector property) divided by the cross sectional area. Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity. A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction. It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3. Such a quantity can be referred to as a tensor of rank 1. The rank refers to the number of subscripts. The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient. So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx. \nWe also know that when we stretch something it gets thinner in the direction normal to the stretch direction. This is the Poisson effect and the ratio extension /contraction is the Poisson ratio.\n\nThis coupling of the different strains caused in a sample by the application of a stress classifies strain as a tensor property. In fact it is a second rank tensor because it consists of a 3 x 3 matrix and hence each element will need two suffixes to locate any one of its components in the matrix, i.e. eij. The physical significance of this will be apparent later.\n\nWe set up a co-ordinate system based on some reference axes in the sample. A convenient one for the case illustrated above is included in the figure. It is a right handed system when reading the axes in the sequence x y z. If we start at a point on the positive x axis and rotate towards the positive y axis in a clockwise direction then positive z axis would point in the direction of movement of a right handed screw.\n\nTo keep it as clear as possible which reference axes we are using it is conventional often to refer to these axes as 1 2 and 3. This is to allow easy identification of the strain terms as depicted in the tenor 3x3 matrix. The directions 1 2 and 3 are synonymous with the x y and z directions.\n\nIn a sample strained in tension (uni-axial tension) as in the above figure, the z axis has been strained in the positive sense, i.e. it becomes longer. The strain term for this deformation is e33. The applied force is acting in the z direction. The first subscript refers to the axis that is being strained and the second to the direction it is being strained. Thus the first subscript 3 refers to the strain is occurring along the z axis and the second subscript to the fact that the strain is in the direction of the z axis. Likewise for the strains e11 and e 22. The strains e 11, e 22 and e 33 are known as tensile or normal strains.\nThe force along z can also be resolved onto inclined planes causing these planes to shear resulting in shear strains. It will also cause the crystal to rotate (called a rigid body rotation). To illustrate this I include a more general deformation, as shown next.\n\nIllustration of tensile and shear strains plus rotation in x z plane.\nx y z right handed axis system, u1 u2 u3 displacements in x y z directions.\nThe figure shows only deformation, that is change of length and direction, in the x z plane for clarity. The tensile strains e11 and e 33 are shown plus the two strains e 13 and e 31. Note the differential form of these latter strains as shown in the figure. Let us consider for now that there is no rotation. Then e 13 and e 31 represent the shear components alone and are in fact equal. The first of the subscript in both of e 13 and e31 signifies the plane that is sheared and the second component the axis defining the direction of shear. Hence the first shear component e13 describes the shear of the plane normal to the x axis and in the z direction whilst the second, e31 defines the shear of the plane normal to the z axis in the x direction. \nSimple (mechanical) shear versus physics\nNow some of you may say, ‘surely shear of a plane distorts a crystal’ as shown in the left sketch below.\n\nSimple shear. (Engineering) Shear (Physics)\nWell this is true and is how engineers express it. As shown in the right hand figure, the shear strain as used in engineering is twice that used by physicists. Engineering strain measures the total strain in the xz plane and is often given the symbol γ. On the other hand, e31, which remember = δu3/δx and in this case where there is no rotation, is simply the average of the strains on the z and x faces i.e. ε31 = ½(e31+e13). Note I have changed the symbol from e31 to ε31. The symbol e31 refers to the strains as measured and may contain a rotational component. The symbol ε31 refers specifically to the shear strain component included in the e31 term. You may need to note this when involved in discussion with engineers. For consistency the Greek symbol ε is used instead of e for the tensile strains as well.\nTensors in Strain\nTensors: Geometric entities introduced into mathematics and physics to extend the notion of scalars, (geometric) vectors, and matrices. Many physical quantities are naturally regarded not as vectors themselves, but as correspondences between one set of vectors and another.\n\nThere is a wide variety of strain measurement techniques, depending on the resolution and precision required. Larger scale methods include the use of strain gauges. For higher precision Raman Spectroscopy and recently emerging techniques such as EBSD are used.\nTraditional measurement of residual strain in metals is through x-ray diffraction. Unfortunately this has major shortcomings in today’s applications and material’s development environment:\nResult: Diffraction volume is too large and individual grains (crystal lattices) cannot be observed or measured accurately.\n\nThe advanced application of the alternative diffraction technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) overcomes these limitations. Software applications such as CrossCourt3 have enabled practical measurement at the nanoscale quite possible.\n\nThe technique of EBSD produces patterns from the metal’s crystallography that consist of a well-defined geometric arrangement of bright bands edged by sharp lines. These are known as Kikuchi bands and Kikuchi lines respectively. Elastic strain changes the width of these bands, and the angles between them plus a general rotation of the entire pattern. The total result is a distortion that involves dilation of the crystal lattice (or unit cell) as a result of tensile and compressive strains, shear strains and rotation. A complete description of internal elastic strain requires that all these crystallographic parameters be measured. This is a benefit of advanced or high accuracy EBSD.\n\n"}

H. Fei and Gustav Ranis and can be understood as an extension of the Lewis model. It is also known as the Surplus Labor model. It recognizes the presence of a dual economy comprising both the modern and the primitive sector and takes the economic situation of unemployment and underemployment of resources into account, unlike many other growth models that consider underdeveloped countries to be homogenous in nature. According to this theory, the primitive sector consists of the existing agricultural sector in the economy, and the modern sector is the rapidly emerging but small industrial sector. Both the sectors co-exist in the economy, wherein lies the crux of the development problem. Development can be brought about only by a complete shift in the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial economy, such that there is augmentation of industrial output. This is done by transfer of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial one, showing that underdeveloped countries do not suffer from constraints of labor supply. At the same time, growth in the agricultural sector must not be negligible and its output should be sufficient to support the whole economy with food and raw materials. Like in the Harrod–Domar model, saving and investment become the driving forces when it comes to economic development of underdeveloped countries.\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of the Lewis model was the undermining of the role of agriculture in boosting the growth of the industrial sector. In addition to that, he did not acknowledge that the increase in productivity of labor should take place prior to the labor shift between the two sectors. However, these two ideas were taken into account in the Fei–Ranis dual economy model of three growth stages. They further argue that the model lacks in the proper application of concentrated analysis to the change that takes place with agricultural development\nIn Phase 1 of the Fei–Ranis model, the elasticity of the agricultural labor work-force is infinite and as a result, suffers from disguised unemployment. Also, the marginal product of labor is zero. This phase is similar to the Lewis model.In Phase 2 of the model, the agricultural sector sees a rise in productivity and this leads to increased industrial growth such that a base for the next phase is prepared. In Phase 2, agricultural surplus may exist as the increasing average product (AP), higher than the marginal product (MP) and not equal to the subsistence level of wages.\n\nUsing the help of the figure on the left, we see that\n\nAccording to Fei and Ranis, AD amount of labor (see figure) can be shifted from the agricultural sector without any fall in output. Hence, it represents surplus labor.\n\nformula_2\n\nAfter AD, MP begins to rise, and industrial labor rises from zero to a value equal to AD. AP of agricultural labor is shown by BYZ and we see that this curve falls downward after AD. This fall in AP can be attributed to the fact that as agricultural laborers shift to the industrial sector, the real wage of industrial laborers decreases due to shortage of food supply, since less laborers are now working in the food sector. The decrease in the real wage level decreases the level of profits, and the size of surplus that could have been re-invested for more industrialization. However, as long as surplus exists, growth rate can still be increased without a fall in the rate of industrialization. This re-investment of surplus can be graphically visualized as the shifting of MP curve outwards. In Phase2 the level of disguised unemployment is given by AK. This allows the agricultural sector to give up a part of its labor-force until\n\nPhase 3 begins from the point of commercialization which is at K in the Figure. This is the point where the economy becomes completely commercialized in the absence of disguised unemployment. The supply curve of labor in Phase 3 is steeper and both the sectors start bidding equally for labor.\n\nThe amount of labor that is shifted and the time that this shifting takes depends upon:\n\nSo, the three fundamental ideas used in this model are:\n\nThis shifting of labor can take place by the landlords' investment activities and by the government's fiscal measures. However, the cost of shifting labor in terms of both private and social cost may be high, for example transportation cost or the cost of carrying out construction of buildings. In addition to that, per capita agricultural consumption can increase, or there can exist a wide gap between the wages of the urban and the rural people. These three occurrences- high cost, high consumption and high gap in wages, are called as leakages, and leakages prevent the creation of agricultural surplus. In fact, surplus generation might be prevented due to a backward-sloping supply curve of labor as well, which happens when high income-levels are not consumed. This would mean that the productivity of laborers with rise in income will not rise. However, the case of backward-sloping curves is mostly unpractical.\n\nFei and Ranis emphasized strongly on the industry-agriculture interdependency and said that a robust connectivity between the two would encourage and speedup development. If agricultural laborers look for industrial employment, and industrialists employ more workers by use of larger capital good stock and labor-intensive technology, this connectivity can work between the industrial and agricultural sector. Also, if the surplus owner invests in that section of industrial sector that is close to soil and is in known surroundings, he will most probably choose that productivity out of which future savings can be channelized. They took the example of Japan's dualistic economy in the 19th century and said that connectivity between the two sectors of Japan was heightened due the presence of a decentralized rural industry which was often linked to urban production. According to them, economic progress is achieved in dualistic economies of underdeveloped countries through the work of a small number of entrepreneurs who have access to land and decision-making powers and use industrial capital and consumer goods for agricultural practices.\n\nIn (A), land is measured on the vertical axis, and labor on the horizontal axis. Ou and Ov represent two ridge lines, and the production contour lines are depicted by M, M and M. The area enclosed by the ridge lines defines the region of factor substitutability, or the region where factors can easily be substituted. Let us understand the repercussions of this. If te amount of labor is the total labor in the agricultural sector, the intersection of the ridge line Ov with the production curve M at point s renders M perfectly horizontal below Ov. The horizontal behavior of the production line implies that outside the region of factor substitutability, output stops and labor becomes redundant once land is fixed and labor is increased.\n\nIf Ot is the total land in the agricultural sector, ts amount of labor can be employed without it becoming redundant, and es represents the redundant agricultural labor force. This led Fei and Ranis to develop the concept of Labor Utilization Ratio, which they define as the units of labor that can be productively employed (without redundancy) per unit of land. In the left-side figure, labor utilization ratio\nwhich is graphically equal to the inverted slope of the ridge line Ov.\n\nFei and Ranis also built the concept of endowment ratio, which is a measure of the relative availability of the two factors of production. In the figure, if Ot represents agricultural land and tE represents agricultural labor, then the endowment ratio is given by\nwhich is equal to the inverted slope of OE.\nThe actual point of endowment is given by E.\n\nFinally, Fei and Ranis developed the concept of non-redundancy coefficient T which is measured by\n\nThese three concepts helped them in formulating a relationship between T, R and S. If ::formula_8\nthen\n\"This mathematical relation proves that the non-redundancy coefficient is directly proportional to labor utilization ratio and is inversely proportional to the endowment ratio.\"\n\n(B) displays the total physical productivity of labor (TPP) curve. The curve increases at a decreasing rate, as more units of labor are added to a fixed amount of land. At point \"N\", the curve shapes horizontally and this point N conforms to the point G in (C, which shows the marginal productivity of labor (MPP) curve, and with point s on the ridge line Ov in (A).\n\nLike in the agricultural sector, Fei and Ranis assume constant returns to scale in the industrial sector. However, the main factors of production are capital and labor. In the graph (A) right hand side, the production functions have been plotted taking labor on the horizontal axis and capital on the vertical axis. The expansion path of the industrial sector is given by the line OAAA. As capital increases from K to K to K and labor increases from L to L and L, the industrial output represented by the production contour A, A and A increases accordingly.\n\nAccording to this model, the prime labor supply source of the industrial sector is the agricultural sector, due to redundancy in the agricultural labor force. (B) shows the labor supply curve for the industrial sector S. PP represents the straight line part of the curve and is a measure of the redundant agricultural labor force on a graph with industrial labor force on the horizontal axis and output/real wage on the vertical axis. Due to the redundant agricultural labor force, the real wages remain constant but once the curve starts sloping upwards from point \"P\", the upward sloping indicates that additional labor would be supplied only with a corresponding rise in the real wages level.\n\nMPP curves corresponding to their respective capital and labor levels have been drawn as M, M, M and M. When capital stock rises from K to K, the marginal physical productivity of labor rises from M to M. When capital stock is K, the MPP curve cuts the labor supply curve at equilibrium point Po. At this point, the total real wage income is W and is represented by the shaded area POLP. λ is the equilibrium profit and is represented by the shaded area qPP. Since the laborers have extremely low income-levels, they barely save from that income and hence industrial profits (π) become the prime source of investment funds in the industrial sector.\n\nHere, \"K\" gives the total supply of investment funds (given that rural savings are represented by \"S\")\n\nTotal industrial activity rises due to increase in the total supply of investment funds, leading to increased industrial employment.\n\nAgricultural surplus in general terms can be understood as the produce from agriculture which exceeds the needs of the society for which it is being produced, and may be exported or stored for future use.\n\nTo understand the formation of agricultural surplus,we must refer to graph (B) of the agricultural sector. The figure on the left is a reproduced version of a section of the previous graph, with certain additions to better explain the concept of agricultural surplus.\nWe first derive the average physical productivity of the total agricultural labor force (APP). Fei and Ranis hypothesize that it is equal to the real wage and this hypothesis is known as the constant institutional wage hypothesis. It is also equal in value to the ratio of total agricultural output to the total agricultural population. Using this relation, we can obtain APP = MP/OP. This is graphically equal to the slope of line OM, and is represented by the line WW in (C).\n\nObserve point Y, somewhere to the left of P on the graph. If a section of the redundant agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the industrial sector, then the labor force remaining in the industrial sector is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the real income of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the industrial sector. This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the industrial sector. Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of industrial sector by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it.\n\nAgricultural surplus plays a major role as a wage fund. Its importance can be better explained with the help of the graph on the right, which is an integration of the industrial sector graph with an inverted agricultural sector graph, such that the origin of the agricultural sector falls on the upper-right corner. This inversion of the origin changes the way the graph is now perceived. While the labor force values are read from the left of 0, the output values are read vertically downwards from O. The sole reason for this inversion is for the sake of convenience. The point of commercialization as explained before (See Section on Basics of the model) is observed at point R, where the tangent to the line ORX runs parallel to OX.\n\nBefore a section of the redundant labor force is absorbed into the industrial sector, the entire labor OA is present in the agricultural sector. Once AG amount of labor force (say) is absorbed, it represented by OG' in the industrial sector, and the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is then OG. But how is the quantity of labor absorbed into the industrial sector determined? (A) shows the supply curve of labor SS' and several demand curves for labor df, d'f' and d\"f\". When the demand for labor is df, the intersection of the demand-supply curves gives the equilibrium employment point G'. Hence OG represents the amount of labor absorbed into the industrial sector. In that case, the labor remaining in the agricultural sector is OG. This OG amount of labor produces an output of GF, out of which GJ amount of labor is consumed by the agricultural sector and JF is the agricultural surplus for that level of employment. Simultaneously, the unproductive labor force from the agricultural sector turns productive once it is absorbed by the industrial sector, and produces an output of OG'Pd as shown in the graph, earning a total wage income of OG'PS.\n\nThe agricultural surplus JF created is needed for consumption by the same workers who left for the industrial sector. Hence, agriculture successfully provides not only the manpower for production activities elsewhere, but also the wage fund required for the process.\n\nThe Lewis model is criticised on the grounds that it neglects agriculture. Fei–Ranis model goes a step beyond and states that agriculture has a very major role to play in the expansion of the industrial sector. In fact, it says that the rate of growth of the industrial sector depends on the amount of total agricultural surplus and on the amount of profits that are earned in the industrial sector. So, larger the amount of surplus and the amount of surplus put into productive investment and larger the amount of industrial profits earned, the larger will be the rate of growth of the industrial economy. As the model focuses on the shifting of the focal point of progress from the agricultural to the industrial sector, Fei and Ranis believe that the ideal shifting takes place when the investment funds from surplus and industrial profits are sufficiently large so as to purchase industrial capital goods like plants and machinery. These capital goods are needed for the creation of employment opportunities. Hence, the condition put by Fei and Ranis for a successful transformation is that\n\nRate of increase of capital stock & rate of employment opportunities > Rate of population growth\n\nAs an underdeveloped country goes through its development process, labor is reallocated from the agricultural to the industrial sector. More the rate of reallocation, faster is the growth of that economy. The economic rationale behind this idea of labor reallocation is that of faster economic development. The essence of labor reallocation lies in Engel's Law, which states that the proportion of income being spent on food decreases with increase in the income-level of an individual, even if there is a rise in the actual expenditure on food. For example, if 90 per cent of the entire population of the concerned economy is involved in agriculture, that leaves just 10 per cent of the population in the industrial sector. As the productivity of agriculture increases, it becomes possible for just 35 per cent of population to maintain a satisfactory food supply for the rest of the population. As a result, the industrial sector now has 65 per cent of the population under it. This is extremely desirable for the economy, as the growth of industrial goods is subject to the rate of per capita income, while the growth of agricultural goods is subject only to the rate of population growth, and so a bigger labor supply to the industrial sector would be welcome under the given conditions. In fact, this labor reallocation becomes necessary with time since consumers begin to want more of industrial goods than agricultural goods in relative terms.\n\nHowever, Fei and Ranis were quick to mention that the necessity of labor reallocation must be linked more to the need to produce more capital investment goods as opposed to the thought of industrial consumer goods following the discourse of Engel's Law. This is because the assumption that the demand for industrial goods is high seems unrealistic, since the real wage in the agricultural sector is extremely low and that hinders the demand for industrial goods. In addition to that, low and mostly constant wage rates will render the wage rates in the industrial sector low and constant. This implies that demand for industrial goods will not rise at a rate as suggested by the use of Engel's Law.\n\nSince the growth process will observes a slow-paced increase in the consumer purchasing power, the dualistic economies follow the path of natural austerity, which is characterized by more demand and hence importance of capital good industries as compared to consumer good ones. However, investment in capital goods comes with a long gestation period, which drives the private entrepreneurs away. This suggests that in order to enable growth, the government must step in and play a major role, especially in the initial few stages of growth. Additionally, the government also works on the social and economic overheads by the construction of roads, railways, bridges, educational institutions, health care facilities and so on.\n\nIn the Fei-Ranis model, it is possible that as technological progress takes place and there is a shift to labor-saving production techniques, growth of the economy takes place with increase in profits but no economic development takes place. This can be explained well with the help of graph in this section.\n\nThe graph displays two MPL lines plotted with real wage and MPL on the vertical axis and employment of labor on the horizontal axis. OW denotes the subsistence wage level, which is the minimum wage level at which a worker (and his family) would survive. The line WW' running parallel to the X-axis is considered to be infinitely elastics since supply of labor is assumed to be unlimited at the subsistence-wage level. The square area OWEN represents the wage bill and DWE represents the surplus or the profits collected. This surplus or profit can increase if the MPL curve changes.\n\nIf the MPL curve changes from MPL to MPL due to a change in production technique, such that it becomes labor-saving or capital-intensive, then the surplus or profit collected would increase. This increase can be seen by comparing DWE with DWE since DWE since is greater in area compared to DWE. However, there is no new point of equilibrium and as E continues to be the point of equilibrium,there is no increase in the level of labor employment, or in wages for that matter. Hence, labor employment continues as ON and wages as OW. The only change that accompanies the change in production technique is the one in surplus or profits.\n\nThis makes for a good example of a process of growth without development, since growth takes place with increase in profits but development is at a standstill since employment and wages of laborers remain the same.\n\nFei–Ranis model of economic growth has been criticized on multiple grounds, although if the model is accepted, then it will have a significant theoretical and policy implications on the underdeveloped countries' efforts towards development and on the persisting controversial statements regarding the balanced vs. unbalanced growth debate.\n\nTo understand this better, we refer to the graph in this section, which shows Food on the vertical axis and Leisure on the horizontal axis. OS represents the subsistence level of food consumption, or the minimum level of food consumed by agricultural labor that is necessary for their survival. I and I between the two commodities of food and leisure (of the agriculturists). The origin falls on G, such that OG represents maximum labor and labor input would be measured from the right to the left.\nThe transformation curve SAG falls from A, which indicates that more leisure is being used to same units of land. At A, the marginal transformation between food and leisure and MPL = 0 and the indifference curve I is also tangent to the transformation curve at this point. This is the point of leisure satiation.\n\nConsider a case where a laborer shifts from the agricultural to the industrial sector. In that case, the land left behind would be divided between the remaining laborers and as a result, the transformation curve would shift from SAG to RTG. Like at point A, MPL at point T would be 0 and APL would continue to be the same as that at A (assuming constant returns to scale). If we consider MPL = 0 as the point where agriculturalists live on the subsistence level, then the curve RTG must be flat at point T in order to maintain the same level of output. However, that would imply leisure satiation or leisure as an inferior good, which are two extreme cases. It can be surmised then that under normal cases, the output would decline with shift of labor to industrial sector, although the per capita output would remain the same. This is because, a fall in the per capita output would mean fall in consumption in a way that it would be lesser than the subsistence level, and the level of labor input per head would either rise or fall.\n\nBerry and Soligo in their 1968 paper have criticized this model for its MPL=0 assumption, and for the assumption that the transfer of labor from the agricultural sector leaves the output in that sector unchanged in Phase 1. They show that the output changes, and may fall under various land tenure systems, unless the following situations arise:\n\n1. Leisure falls under the inferior good category\n2. Leisure satiation is present.\n3. There is perfect substitutability between food and leisure, and the marginal rate of substitution is constant for all real income levels.\n\nNow if MPL>0 then leisure satiation option becomes invalid, and if MPL=0 then the option of food and leisure as perfect substitutes becomes invalid. Therefore, the only remaining viable option is leisure as an inferior good.\n\n"}

Anything can be considered gynocentric when it is concerned exclusively with a female (or feminist) point of view.\n\nThe term gynocentrism has been in use since at least 1897 when it appeared in The Open Court stating that Continental Europeans view Americans \"as suffering rather from gynocentrism than anthropocentrism.\" In 1914, author George A. Birmingham stated that \"American social life seems to me gynocentric. It is arranged with a view to the convenience and delight of women. Men come in where and how they can.\"\n\nBeginning with second-wave feminism in the 1970s, the term gynocentrism has been used to describe difference feminism, which displayed a shift towards understanding and accepting gender differences, in contrast to equality feminism.\n\nAccording to University of Massachusetts philosopher Christa Hodapp, in modern men's movements gynocentrism is described as a continuation of the courtly love conventions of medieval times, wherein women were valued as a quasi-aristocratic class, and males were seen as a lower serving class. This antifeminist viewpoint describes feminism as the perpetuation of oppressive medieval conventions such as devotional chivalry and romanticized relationships, rather than as a movement towards liberation.\n\nReligious studies professors Paul Nathanson and Katherine K. Young claim that feminist calls for equality or equity are a subterfuge for gynocentrism.\n\nThe term \"gynocentrism\" is derived from ancient Greek, γυνή and κέντρον. Γυνή can be translated as \"woman\" or \"female\", but also as \"wife\". In ancient Greek compounds with γυνή, the stem γυναικ- is normally used. This stem can be spotted in the genitive case γυναικός, and in the older form of the nominative case γύναιξ. In ancient Greek, no compounds are known to exist with γυνή that start with γυνο- or γυνω-.\n\nThe ancient Greek word κέντρον can be translated as \"sharp point\", \"sting (of bees and wasps)\", \"point of a spear\" and \"stationary point of a pair of compasses\", with the meaning \"centre of a circle\" related to the latter. The meaning \"centre/middle point (of a circle)\" is preserved in the Latin word \"centrum\", a loanword from ancient Greek. The English word \"centre\" is derived from the Latin \"centrum\". The word κέντρον is derived from the verb κεντεῖν, meaning \"to sting (of bees)\", \"to prick\", \"to goad\", and \"to spur\". When trying to explain etymologically the term \"gynocentrism\", it is important to consider the ancient Greek κέντρον, with the signification \"middle point/centre\", and not the more obvious ancient Greek word κεντρισμός (mirroring \"-centrism\").\n\nNathanson and Young state that ideologically, the overriding focus of gynocentrism is to prioritize females hierarchically, and as a result may be interpreted as misandry (hatred of and prejudice towards men). Feminist calls for equality or even equity are often, according to them, a subterfuge for gynocentrism.\n\nThey define gynocentrism as a worldview based on the implicit or explicit belief that the world revolves around women, a cultural theme that they claim has become 'de rigueur' behind the scenes in law courts and government bureaucracies, resulting in systemic discrimination against men. They further state that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism – as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women- to the extent that it focuses on the innate \"virtues\" of women and the innate \"vices\" of men.\n\nSome authors make discriminations between \"individual\" gynocentric acts and events, such as Mother's Day, and the more general concept of a \"gynocentric culture\" which refers to a larger collection of culture traits that have major significance in the way people’s lives were lived.\n\nSome post-modern feminists such as Nancy Fraser question the assumption of a stable concept of 'woman' which underlies all gynocentrism. Nathanson and Young make a comparable claim that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women, to the extent that it focuses on the innate virtues of women. Nathanson and Young add that \"This worldview is explicitly misandric too, because it not only ignores the needs and problems of men, but also attacks men.\"\n\nChristina Hoff Sommers has argued that gynocentrism is anti-intellectual and holds an antagonistic view of traditional scientific and creative disciplines, dismissing many important discoveries and artistic works as masculine. Sommers also writes that the presumption of objectivity ascribed to many gynocentrist theories has stifled feminist discourse and interpretation.\n\nFeminist writer Lynda Burns emphasises that gynocentrism calls for a celebration of women's positive differences—of women's history, myths, arts and music—as opposed to an assimilationist model privileging similarity to men. However observed in practice, the preeminence of women associated with gynocentric narratives is often seen as absolute: interpersonally, culturally, historically, politically, or in broader social contexts such as popular entertainment. As such, it can shade into what Rosalind Coward called \"womanism...a sort of popularized version of feminism which acclaims everything women do and disparages men\".\n\nThe Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) community describes themselves as a backlash against the misandry of gynocentrism.\n\n\n"}

Innumeracy is a problem with many otherwise educated and knowledgeable people. While many people would be ashamed to admit they are illiterate, there is very little shame in saying \"I'm a people person, not a numbers person.\" Or \"I always hated math\".\n\nPaulos speaks mainly of the common misconceptions in regard to numbers. He looks at real-world examples in stock scams, psychics, astrology, sports records, elections, sex discrimination, UFOs, insurance and law, lotteries and drug testing. Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way. The book sheds light on the link between innumeracy and pseudoscience. For example, the fortune telling psychic's few correct and general observations are remembered over the many incorrect guesses. He also stresses the problem between the actual number of occurrences of various risks and popular perceptions of those risks happening. The problems of innumeracy come at a great cost to society. Topics include probability and coincidence, innumeracy in pseudoscience, statistics and trade-offs in society. For example, the danger of getting killed in a car accident is much greater than terrorism and this danger should be reflected in how we allocate our limited resources.\n\nJohn Allen Paulos (born July 4, 1945) is an American professor of mathematics at Temple University in Pennsylvania. He is a writer and speaker on mathematics and the importance of mathematical literacy. Paulos writes about many subjects, especially of the dangers of mathematical innumeracy; that is, the layperson's misconceptions about numbers, probability and logic. He has received awards in:\n2013 JPBM (Joint Policy Board for Mathematics) Award for Communicating Mathematics on a Sustained Basis to Large Audiences.\n2003 AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Award for Promoting the Public Understanding of Science and Technology.\n\nAs a reasons for writing the book he states:\nInnumeracy, an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance, plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens. The same people who cringe when words such as “imply” and “infer” are confused react without a trace of embarrassment to even the most egregious of numerical solecisms. I remember once listening to someone at a party drone on about the difference between “continually” and “continuously.” Later that evening we were watching the news, and the TV weathercaster announced that there was a 50 percent chance of rain for Saturday and a 50 percent chance for Sunday, and concluded that there was therefore a 100 percent chance of rain that weekend. The remark went right by the self-styled grammarian, and even after I explained the mistake to him, he wasn’t nearly as indignant as he would have been had the weathercaster left a dangling participle.\n\n\"Innumeracy\" made the New York Times best seller the year it came out in 1988. It was on the New York Times best seller for 18 weeks. There was a slightly revised addition in 2001. It received favorable reviews in the New York Times \"He takes us a couple of steps closer to numeracy, and it is all in all an enlightening place to be.\" The Chicago Tribune wrote \"Despite the title, which suggests yet another learned report documenting the sorry state of America's educational system, what Paulos provides is a readable romp across a varied mathematical landscape.\nIt serves as an excellent antidote to tedious classroom lectures on the difference between inverse and direct proportions.\" The LA Times review noted \"\"Paulos is very good at explaining all of this, though sometimes with a hectoring, bitter tone, for which he apologizes at the very end.\" The Christian Science Monitor review said \"Should you read \"Innumeracy\" if you enjoy reading math problems and reasoning them out? Yes, it's fun. Should you read it if you think you hate math and are turned off by math problems? Yes, you may even get turned on.\"\n"}

There exist various transformations between these frames. Despite the fact that these frames have been around for some time there is currently heated debate about whether either, both, or neither frame is a 'physical' frame which can be compared to observations and experiment.\n\nIf we perform the Weyl rescaling formula_1, then the Riemann and Ricci tensors are modified as follows.\nAs an example consider the transformation of a simple Scalar-tensor action with an arbitrary set of matter fields formula_4 coupled minimally to the curved background\nThe tilde fields then correspond to quantities in the Jordan frame and the fields without the tilde correspond to fields in the Einstein frame. See that the matter action formula_6 changes only in the rescaling of the metric.\n\nThe Jordan and Einstein frames are constructed to render certain parts of physical equations simpler which also gives the frames and the fields appearing in them particular physical interpretations. For instance, in the Einstein frame, the equations for the gravitational field will be of the form\nI.e., they can be interpreted as the usual Einstein equations with particular sources on the right-hand side. Similarly, in the Newtonian limit one would recover the Poisson equation for the Newtonian potential with separate source terms.\n\nHowever, by transforming in the Einstein frame the matter fields are now not coupled simply to the background but also to the field formula_8 which now acts as an effective potential. Specifically, an isolated test particle will experience a universal four-acceleration\nwhere formula_10 is the particle four-velocity. I.e., no particle will be in free-fall in the Einstein frame.\n\nOn the other hand, in the Jordan frame, all the matter fields formula_4 are coupled minimally to formula_12 and isolated test particles will move on geodesics with respect to the metric formula_12. This means that if we were to reconstruct the Riemann curvature tensor by measurements of geodesic deviation, we would in fact obtain the curvature tensor in the Jordan frame. When, on the other hand, we deduce on the presence of matter sources from gravitational lensing from the usual relativistic theory, we obtain the distribution of the matter sources in the sense of the Einstein frame.\n\nJordan frame gravity can be used to calculate type IV singular bouncing cosmological evolution, to derive the type IV singularity.\n\n\n"}

Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics arising from the study of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe origins of Koopman–von Neumann (KvN) theory are tightly connected with the rise of ergodic theory as an independent branch of mathematics, in particular with Boltzmann's ergodic hypothesis.\n\nIn 1931 Koopman and André Weil independently observed that the phase space of the classical system can be converted into a Hilbert space by postulating a natural integration rule over the points of the phase space as the definition of the scalar product, and that this transformation allows drawing of interesting conclusions about the evolution of physical observables from Stone's theorem, which had been proved shortly before. This finding inspired von Neumann to apply the novel formalism to the ergodic problem. Already in 1932 he completed the operator reformulation of quantum mechanics currently known as Koopman–von Neumann theory. Subsequently, he published several seminal results in modern ergodic theory including the proof of his mean ergodic theorem\".\n\nIn the approach of Koopman and von Neumann (KvN), dynamics in phase space is described by a (classical) probability density, recovered from an underlying wavefunction – the Koopman–von Neumann wavefunction – as the square of its absolute value (more precisely, as the amplitude multiplied with its own complex conjugate). This stands in analogy to the Born rule in quantum mechanics. In the KvN framework, observables are represented by commuting self-adjoint operators acting on the Hilbert space of KvN wavefunctions. The commutativity physically implies that all observables are simultaneously measurable. Contrast this with quantum mechanics, where observables need not commute, which underlines the uncertainty principle, Kochen–Specker theorem, and Bell inequalities.\n\nThe KvN wavefunction is postulated to evolve according to exactly the same Liouville equation as the classical probability density. From this postulate it can be shown that indeed probability density dynamics is recovered.\n\nConversely, it is possible to start from operator postulates, similar to the Hilbert space axioms of quantum mechanics, and derive the equation of motion by specifying how expectation values evolve.\n\nThe relevant axioms are that as in quantum mechanics (i) the states of a system are represented by normalized vectors of a complex Hilbert space, and the observables are given by self-adjoint operators acting on that space, (ii) the expectation value of an observable is obtained in the manner as the expectation value in quantum mechanics, (iii) the probabilities of measuring certain values of some observables are calculated by the Born rule, and (iv) the state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the subsystem's spaces.\n\nIn the Hilbert space and operator formulation of classical mechanics, the Koopman von Neumann–wavefunction takes the form of a superposition of eigenstates, and measurement collapses the KvN wavefunction to the eigenstate which is associated the measurement result, in analogy to the wave function collapse of quantum mechanics.\n\nHowever, it can be shown that for Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics \"non-selective measurements\" leave the KvN wavefunction unchanged.\n\nThe KvN dynamical equation () and Liouville equation () are first-order linear partial differential equations. One recovers Newton's laws of motion by applying the method of characteristics to either of these equations. Hence, the key difference between KvN and Liouville mechanics lies in weighting individual trajectories: Arbitrary weights, underlying the classical wave function, can be utilized in the KvN mechanics, while only positive weights, representing the probability density, are permitted in the Liouville mechanics (see this scheme).\n\nBeing explicitly based on the Hilbert space language, the KvN classical mechanics adopts many techniques from quantum mechanics, for example, perturbation and diagram techniques as well as functional integral methods. The KvN approach is very general, and it has been extended to dissipative systems, relativistic mechanics, and classical field theories.\n\nThe KvN approach is fruitful in studies on the quantum-classical correspondence as it reveals that the Hilbert space formulation is not exclusively quantum mechanical. Even Dirac spinors are not exceptionally quantum as they are utilized in the relativistic generalization of the KvN mechanics. Similarly as the more well-known phase space formulation of quantum mechanics, the KvN approach can be understood as an attempt to bring classical and quantum mechanics into a common mathematical framework. In fact, the time evolution of the Wigner function approaches, in the classical limit, the time evolution of the KvN wavefunction of a classical particle. However, a mathematical resemblance to quantum mechanics does not imply the presence of hallmark quantum effects. In particular, impossibility of double-slit experiment and Aharonov–Bohm effect are explicitly demonstrated in the KvN framework.\n\n\n"}

It can also be described as the unit revenue the last item sold has generated for the firm. In a perfectly competitive market, the additional revenue generated by selling an additional unit of a good is equal to the price the firm is able to charge the buyer of the good. This is because a firm in a competitive market will always get the same price for every unit it sells regardless of the number of units the firm sells since the firm's sales can never impact the industry's price. However, a monopoly determines the entire industry's sales. As a result, it will have to lower the price of all units sold to increase sales by 1 unit. Therefore, the marginal revenue generated is always lower than the price the firm is able to charge for the unit sold, since each reduction in price causes unit revenue to decline on every good the firm sells. The marginal revenue (the increase in total revenue) is the price the firm gets on the additional unit sold, less the revenue lost by reducing the price on all other units that were sold prior to the decrease in price. \n\nA firms profits will be maximized when marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). If formula_1 then a firm should increase output for more profits, if formula_2 then a firm should decrease output for additional profits. A firm should choose the output level which is profit maximizing under perfect competition theory formula_3.\n\nMarginal revenue is equal to the ratio of the change in revenue for some change in quantity sold to that change in quantity sold. This can also be represented as a derivative when the change in quantity sold becomes arbitrarily small. More formally, define the revenue function to be the following\n\nBy the product rule, marginal revenue is then given by\n\nFor a firm facing perfect competition, price does not change with quantity sold (formula_6), so marginal revenue is equal to price. For a monopoly, the price decreases with quantity sold (formula_7), so marginal revenue is less than price (for positive formula_8).\n\nThe marginal revenue curve is affected by the same factors as the demand curve - changes in income, change in the prices of complements and substitutes, change in populations. These factors can cause the R curve to shift and rotate.\n\nThe relationship between marginal revenue and the elasticity of demand by the firm's customers can be derived as follows:\n\nwhere e is the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic (e < 1) then R' will be negative, because to sell a marginal (infinitesimal) unit the firm would have to lower the selling price so much that it would lose more revenue on the pre-existing units than it would gain on the incremental unit. If demand is elastic (e > 1) R' will be positive, because the additional unit would not drive down the price by so much. If the firm is a perfect competitor, so that it is so small in the market that its quantity produced and sold has no effect on the price, then the price elasticity of demand is negative infinity, and marginal revenue simply equals the (market-determined) price.\n\nProfit maximization requires that a firm produces where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Firm managers are unlikely to have complete information concerning their marginal revenue function or their marginal costs. Fortunately, the profit maximization conditions can be expressed in a “more easily applicable form” or rule of thumb.\n\nMarkup is the difference between price and marginal cost. The formula states that markup as a percentage of price equals the negative of the inverse of elasticity of demand. Alternatively, the relationship can be expressed as:\n\nThus if e is - 2 and mc is $5.00 then price is $10.00.\n\n(<R> - C')/ <R> = - 1/e is called the Lerner index after economist Abba Lerner. The Lerner index is a measure of market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price that exceeds marginal cost. The index varies from zero to 1. The greater the difference between price and marginal cost the closer the index value is to 1. The Lerner index increases as demand becomes less elastic.\n\nExample\nIf a company can sell 10 units at $20 each or 11 units at $19 each, then the marginal revenue from the eleventh unit is (11 × 19) - (10 × 20) = $9.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "240058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240058", "title": "Masculinity", "text": "Masculinity\n\nMasculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men. As a social construct, it is distinct from the definition of the male biological sex. Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods. Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior.\n\nTraits traditionally viewed as masculine in Western society include strength, courage, independence, violence, and assertiveness. Machismo is a form of masculinity that emphasizes power and is often associated with a disregard for consequences and responsibility. Virility (from the Latin \"\", \"man\") is similar to masculinity, but especially emphasizes strength, energy, and sex drive.\n\nMasculine qualities and roles are considered typical of, appropriate for, and expected of boys and men. The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally; although the dandy was seen as a 19th-century ideal of masculinity, he is considered effeminate by modern standards. Masculine norms, as described in Ronald F. Levant's \"Masculinity Reconstructed\", are \"avoidance of femininity; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; strength and aggression, and homophobia\". These norms reinforce gender roles by associating attributes and characteristics with one gender.\n\nThe academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300. This has sparked investigation of the intersection of masculinity with other axes of social discrimination and concepts from other fields, such as the social construction of gender difference (prevalent in a number of philosophical and sociological theories).\n\nBoth males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and feminine characteristics are considered androgynous, and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.\n\nSince what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to Raewyn Connell, it is more appropriate to discuss \"masculinities\" than a single overarching concept. Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a \"strict gendering of the public/private divide\"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life. Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience. Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.\n\nAccording to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life. A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a \"high level of generality\" in \"broad surveys of cultural norms\". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.\n\nAncient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. In the Hebrew Bible of 1000 BC, King David of Israel told his son, \"I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;\" after David's death. Throughout history, men have met exacting cultural standards. Kate Cooper wrote about ancient concepts of femininity, \"Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for.\" According to the \"Code of Hammurabi\" (about 1750 BC):\nScholars cite integrity and equality as masculine values in male-male relationships and virility in male-female relationships. Legends of ancient heroes include the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire respect, such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other men do not know and taking risks other men would not dare.\n\nJeffrey Richards describes a European \"medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric\". Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The Anglo-Saxons Hengest and Horsa and Beowulf are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as J. R. R. Tolkien) that \"Beowulf\" is a tale of medieval heroism overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf \"cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household\".\n\nDuring the Victorian era, masculinity underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1831: \"The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; Werterism, Byronism, even Brummelism, each has its day\".\n\nBoxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century, and emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity. Bare-knuckle fighting without gloves represented \"the manly art\" in 19th century America.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, a traditional family consisted of the father as breadwinner and the mother as homemaker. Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. Central to adult men's identities is the provider role, as masculinity is often measured by the size of one's paycheck/economic contribution to the family. Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women and femininity.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the twentieth century to today is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood. Social theorist Erving Goffman's seminal work on stigma management presents a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for contemporary men:In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, or good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.\n\nThere is some evidence of masculinities undergoing shifts in the contemporary social landscape. Characteristic of present-day masculinity is men's willingness to counter stereotypes. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.\n\nIn many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical of one's gender may be a social problem. In sociology, this labeling is known as gender assumptions and is part of socialization to meet the mores of a society. Non-standard behavior may be considered indicative of homosexuality, despite the fact that gender expression, gender identity and sexual orientation are widely accepted as distinct concepts. When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice (as in early sexology studies), male homosexuality is interpreted as effeminacy. Social disapproval of excessive masculinity may be expressed as \"machismo\" or by neologisms such as \"testosterone poisoning\".\n\nThe relative importance of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity is debated. Although social conditioning is believed to play a role, psychologists and psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung believed that aspects of \"feminine\" and \"masculine\" identity are subconsciously present in all human males.\n\nThe historical development of gender roles is addressed by behavioural genetics, evolutionary psychology, human ecology, anthropology and sociology. All human cultures seem to encourage gender roles in literature, costume and song; examples may include the epics of Homer, the Hengist and Horsa tales and the normative commentaries of Confucius. More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the bushidō of \"Hagakure\".\n\nThe sources of gender identity are debated. Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with male genitalia. Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men hormonally and physically, and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven. On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it. Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.\n\nIn contrast to earlier perspectives of the nature versus nurture debate, contemporary social scientists suggest masculinity to stem from both nature \"and\" nurture, as both biological predispositions and social factors intersect to give rise to masculine gender identities. Scholars suggest that innate differences between the sexes are compounded and/or exaggerated by the influences of social factors.\n\nSocial scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance. Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one's gender is \"natural\" or biologically-ordained.\n\nThe social construction of gender also conceptualizes gender as a continuum. Theorists suggest one is not simply masculine or feminine, but instead may display components of both masculinity and femininity to different degrees and in particular contexts.\n\nMasculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings. Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys. As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.\n\nTraditional avenues for men to gain honor were providing for their families and exercising leadership. Raewyn Connell has labeled traditional male roles and privileges hegemonic masculinity, encouraged in men and discouraged in women: \"Hegemonic masculinity can be defined as the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy, which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women\". Connell (1987) placed emphasis on heterosexuality and its influence on the construction of gender. From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities). In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.\n\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior. \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not \"being a man\". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.\n\nIn 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status. Men who identify with creative pursuits, such as poetry or painting, may not experience manhood as precarious but may respond to threats to their intelligence or creativity. However, men who identify with traditionally-masculine pursuits (such as football or the military) may see masculinity as precarious. According to Winegard, Winegard, and Geary, this is functional; poetry and painting do not require traditionally-masculine traits, and attacks on those traits should not induce anxiety. Football and the military require traditionally-masculine traits, such as pain tolerance, endurance, muscularity and courage, and attacks on those traits induce anxiety and may trigger retaliatory impulses and behavior. This suggests that nature-versus-nurture debates about masculinity may be simplistic. Although men evolved to pursue prestige and dominance (status), how they pursue status depends on their talents, traits and available possibilities. In modern societies, more avenues to status may exist than in traditional societies and this may mitigate the precariousness of manhood (or of traditional manhood); however, it will probably not mitigate the intensity of male-male competition.\n\nAlthough often ignored in discussions of masculinity, women can also express masculine traits and behaviors. In Western culture, female masculinity has been codified into identities such as \"tomboy\" and \"butch\". Although female masculinity is often associated with lesbianism, expressing masculinity is not necessarily related to a woman's sexuality. In feminist philosophy, female masculinity is often characterized as a type of gender performance which challenges traditional masculinity and male dominance. Zachary A. Kramer argues that the discussion of masculinity should be opened up \"to include constructions of masculinity that uniquely affect women.\" Masculine women are often subject to social stigma and harassment, although the influence of the feminist movement has led to greater acceptance of women expressing masculinity in recent decades. Women with stereotypically masculine personality traits are more likely to gain access to high-paying occupations than women with feminine personality traits.\n\nWomen who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the \"female/athlete paradox\". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, ice hockey, and motor sports, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer repercussions such as discrimination or mistreatment from administrators, harassment by fans, and decreased media attention.\n\nEvidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5 million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.\n\nStudies of men in North America and Europe show that men who consume alcoholic drinks often do so in order to fulfill certain social expectations of manliness. While the causes of drinking and alcoholism are complex and varied, gender roles and social expectations have a strong influence encouraging men to drink.\n\nIn 2004, Arran Stibbe published an analysis of a well-known men's-health magazine in 2000. According to Stibbe, although the magazine ostensibly focused on health it also promoted traditional masculine behaviors such as excessive consumption of convenience foods and meat, alcohol consumption and unsafe sex.\n\nResearch on beer-commercial content by Lance Strate yielded results relevant to a study of masculinity. In beer commercials, masculine behavior (especially risk-taking) is encouraged. Commercials often focus on situations in which a man overcomes an obstacle in a group, working or playing hard (construction or farm workers or cowboys). Those involving play have central themes of mastery (of nature or each other), risk and adventure: fishing, camping, playing sports or socializing in bars. There is usually an element of danger and a focus on movement and speed (watching fast cars or driving fast). The bar is a setting for the measurement of masculinity in skills such as billiards, strength, and drinking ability. Men engage in positive health practices, such as reducing fat intake and alcohol, to conform to masculine ideals.\n\nGay men are considered by some to \"deviate from the masculine norm\" and are benevolently stereotyped as \"gentle and refined\", even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell:\nContrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are \"just the same\" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of queer fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.\n\nPsychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a dichotomy of homosexual and heterosexual males: \"Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are \"real men\" and have power, and males who are not\". Michael Kimmel adds that the trope \"You're so gay\" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation. According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, patriarchal structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.\n\nIn the documentary \"The Butch Factor\", gay men (one of them transgender) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the closet, allowing \"butch\" gay men to conceal their sexual orientation longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports. Effeminacy is inaccurately associated with homosexuality, and some gay men doubted their sexual orientation; they did not see themselves as effeminate, and felt little connection to gay culture. Some effeminate gay men in \"The Butch Factor\" felt uncomfortable about their femininity (despite being comfortable with their sexuality), and feminine gay men may be derided by stereotypically-masculine gays.\n\nFeminine-looking men tended to come out earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives, they are taunted by derogatory words (such as \"sissy\") implying feminine qualities. Effeminate, \"campy\" gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew called \"camp humor\", such as referring to one another by female pronouns (according to Ballew, \"a funny way of defusing hate directed toward us [gay men]\"); however, such humor \"can cause us [gay men] to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men\". He further stated:\n\nA study by the Center for Theoretical Study at Charles University in Prague and the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic found significant differences in shape among the faces of heterosexual and gay men, with gay men having more \"stereotypically masculine\" features (\"undermin[ing] stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.\")\n\nGay men have been presented in the media as feminine and open to ridicule, although films such as \"Brokeback Mountain\" are countering the stereotype. A recent development is the portrayal of gay men in the LGBT community as \"bears\", a subculture of gay men celebrating rugged masculinity and \"secondary sexual characteristics of the male: facial hair, body hair, proportional size, baldness\".\n\nSecond-wave pro-feminism paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to increased cooperation between the men's liberation and gay liberation movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a social construct and in response to the universalization of \"men\" in previous men's movements. Men's-rights activists worked to stop second-wave feminists from influencing the gay-rights movement, promoting hypermasculinity as inherent to gay sexuality.\n\nMasculinity has played an important role in lesbian culture, although lesbians vary widely in the degree to which they express masculinity and femininity. In LGBT cultures, masculine women are often referred to as \"butch\".\n\nTwo concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right. This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming \"the bottom line, the real historical reality\". Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work of in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument. Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s. Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was \"most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)\". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as \"Scott of the Antarctic\" represented the era’s masculine fantasies. Michael Roper’s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination \"of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up\" (Tosh's human experience).\n\nAccording to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged \"questions of behaviour and agency\". His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.\n\nStefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its historiographic development. Abigail Solomou-Godeau’s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.\n\nTosh’s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the \"social expectation\" of their work, which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an \"outflanking movement\" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study. This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the Low Countries, Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building). Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because \"men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination\"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.\n\nMedia images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising. Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity \"economically exploitative\" and \"socially oppressive\": \"The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor.\"\n\nAccording to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the American Psychological Association, \"Instead of seeing a decrease in objectification of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today.\" Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to eating disorders. Psychiatrist Thomas Holbrook cited a recent Canadian study indicating that as many as one in six people with eating disorders are men.\n\nResearch in the United Kingdom found, \"Younger men and women who read fitness and fashion magazines could be psychologically harmed by the images of perfect female and male physiques.\" Young women and men exercise excessively in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-fit and muscular body, which may lead to body dysmorphic disorder or muscle dysmorphia. Although the stereotypes may have remained constant, the value attached to masculine stereotypes has changed; it has been argued that masculinity is an unstable phenomenon, never ultimately achieved.\n\nIn 1987 Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of \"masculine stress\" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:\n\nBecause of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may \"lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced.\" Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Brett Martin and Juergen Gnoth (2009) found that although feminine men privately preferred feminine models, they expressed a preference for traditional masculine models in public; according to the authors, this reflected social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.\n\nIn their book \"Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys\", Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and hypermasculinity) limits their ability to function as emotionally-healthy adults. According to Kindlon and Thompson, boys lack the ability to understand and express emotions productively because of the stress imposed by masculine gender roles.\n\nIn the article \"Sexual Ethics, Masculinity and Mutual Vulnerability\", Rob Cover works to unpack Judith Butler's study of masculinity. Cover goes over issues such as sexual assault and how it can be partially explained by a hypermasculinity.\n\nA theory of \"masculinity in crisis\" has emerged; Australian archeologist Peter McAllister said, \"I have a strong feeling that masculinity is in crisis. Men are really searching for a role in modern society; the things we used to do aren't in much demand anymore\". Others see the changing labor market as a source of stress. Deindustrialization and the replacement of smokestack industries by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.\n\nThe crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the feminist movement. British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that \"masculinity has always been in one crisis or another\", suggesting that the crises arise from the \"fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them\".\n\nAccording to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis. He writes that the \"crisis\" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and post-industrial society), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature \"crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself\". Film scholar Leon Hunt also writes: \"Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s\".\n\nIn 2008, the word \"herbivore men\" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. Masahiro Morioka characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain.

(See NLP modeling.)\n\nAs the name implies, in the modeling the client learns new skills by imitating another person, such as a parent or therapist, who performs the behavior to be acquired. A younger client may be exposed to behaviors or roles in peers who act as assistants to therapist & then be encouraged to imitate & practice the desired new responses. For example, modeling may be used to promote the learning of simple skills such as self-feeding for a profoundly intellectually disabled child, or more complex skills such as being more effective in social situations for a shy withdrawn adolescent.\n\nThe concept of behavioral modeling was most memorably introduced by Albert Bandura in his famous 1961 Bobo Doll Experiment. In this study, 72 children from ages three to five were divided into groups to watch an adult confederate interact with an assortment of toys in the experiment room, including an inflated Bobo doll. For children assigned the non-aggressive condition, the confederate ignored the doll. For children assigned the aggressive condition, the confederate spent the majority of the time physically aggressing the doll and shouting at it.\n\nAfter the confederate left the room, the children were given the opportunity to individually interact with similar toys. Children who observed the non-aggressive confederate's behavior played quietly with the toys and rarely initiated violence toward the Bobo doll. Children who watched the aggressive confederate were more likely to imitate the confederate's behavior by hitting, kicking, and shouting at the Bobo doll.\n\nBandura proposed that four components contribute to behavioral modeling.\n\n\nThe mirror neuron system, located in the frontal lobe of the brain, is a network of neurons that become active when an animal either performs a behavior or observes that behavior being performed by another. For example, the same mirror neurons will become active when a monkey grasps an object as when it watches another monkey do so. While the significance of mirror neurons is still up for debate in the scientific community, there are many who believe them to be the primary biological component in imitative learning.\n\n"}
{"id": "13820566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13820566", "title": "Monism and dualism in international law", "text": "Monism and dualism in international law\n\nThe terms monism and dualism are used to describe two different theories of the relationship between international law and national law. Many states, perhaps most, are partly monist and partly dualist in their actual application of international law in their national systems.\n\nMonists accept that the internal and international legal systems form a unity. Both national legal rules and international rules that a state has accepted, for example by way of a treaty, determine whether actions are legal or illegal. In most so-called \"monist\" states, a distinction between international law in the form of treaties, and other international law, e.g., customary international law or jus cogens, is made; such states may thus be partly monist and partly dualist.\nState sovereignty as well.\nIn a pure monist state, international law does not need to be translated into national law. It is just incorporated and has effect automatically in national or domestic laws. The act of ratifying an international treaty immediately incorporates the law into national law; and customary international law is treated as part of national law as well. International law can be directly applied by a national judge, and can be directly invoked by citizens, just as if it were national law. A judge can declare a national rule invalid if it contradicts international rules because, in some states, the latter have priority. In other states, like in Germany, treaties have the same effect as legislation, and by the principle of \"Lex posterior derogat priori\" (\"Later law removes the earlier\"), only take precedence over national legislation enacted prior to their ratification. In its most pure form, monism dictates that national law that contradicts international law is null and void, even if it post-dates international law, and even if it is constitutional in nature.\nFrom a human rights point of view, for example, this has some advantages. Suppose a country has accepted a human rights treaty - the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for instance - but some of its national laws limit the freedom of the press. A citizen of that country, who is being prosecuted by his state for violating this national law, can invoke the human rights treaty in a national courtroom and can ask the judge to apply this treaty and to decide that the national law is invalid. He or she does not have to wait for national law that translates international law. His or her government can, after all, be negligent or even unwilling to translate. The treaty was perhaps only accepted for political reasons, in order to please donor-countries for example.\n\"So when someone in The Netherlands feels his human rights are being violated he can go to a Dutch judge and the judge must apply the law of the Convention. He must apply international law even if it is not in conformity with Dutch law\".\n\nDualists emphasize the difference between national and international law, and require the translation of the latter into the former. Without this translation, international law does not exist as law. International law has to be national law as well, or it is no law at all. If a state accepts a treaty but does not adapt its national law in order to conform to the treaty or does not create a national law explicitly incorporating the treaty, then it violates international law. But one cannot claim that the treaty has become part of national law. Citizens cannot rely on it and judges cannot apply it. National laws that contradict it remain in force. According to dualists, national judges never apply international law, only international law that has been translated into national law.\n\"International law as such can confer no rights cognisable in the municipal courts. It is only insofar as the rules of international law are recognized as included in the rules of municipal law that they are allowed in municipal courts to give rise to rights and obligations\".\nThe supremacy of international law is a rule in dualist systems as it is in monist systems. Sir Hersch Lauterpacht pointed out the Court's determination to discourage the evasion of international obligations, and its repeated affirmation of:\n\nIf international law is not directly applicable, as is the case in dualist systems, then it must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be \"translated away\". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law.\nAgain, from a human rights point of view, if a human rights treaty is accepted for purely political reasons, and states do not intend to fully translate it into national law or to take a monist view on international law, then the implementation of the treaty is very uncertain.\n\nIn dualist systems, international law must be translated into national law, and existing national law that contradicts international law must be \"translated away\". It must be modified or eliminated in order to conform to international law. However, the need for translation in dualist system causes a problem with regard to national laws voted after the act of translation. \nIn a monist system, a national law that is voted after an international law has been accepted and that contradicts the international law, becomes automatically null and void at the moment it is voted. The international rule continues to prevail. In a dualist system, however, the original international law has been translated into national law - if all went well - but this national law can then be overridden by another national law on the principle of \"lex posterior derogat legi priori\", the later law replaces the earlier one. This means that the country - willingly or unwillingly - violates international law. A dualist system requires continuous screening of all subsequent national law for possible incompatibility with earlier international law.\n\nIn some countries, such as the UK for instance, the dualist view is predominant. International law is only part of British national law once it is accepted in national law. A treaty\n\nIn other countries this distinction tends to be blurred. In the vast majority of democratic countries outside the Commonwealth, the legislature, or part of the legislature, participates in the process of ratification, so that ratification becomes a legislative act, and the treaty becomes effective in international law and in municipal law simultaneously. For instance, the Constitution of the United States provides that the President\n\nTreaties ratified in accordance with the Constitution automatically become part of the municipal law of the USA\".\n\nThe United States of America has a \"mixed\" monist-dualist system; international law applies directly in US courts in some instances but not others. US Constitution, art. VI, does indeed say that treaties are part of the Supreme Law of the Land, as suggested by the quote above; however, its Supreme Court, as late as the recent case of \"Medellín v. Texas\", has restated that some treaties are not \"self-executing.\" Such treaties must be implemented by statute before their provisions may be given effect by national and sub-national courts. Similarly with regard to customary international law, its Supreme Court stated, in the case of the Pacquete Habana (1900), that \"international law is part of our law.\" However, it also said that international law would not be applied if there is a controlling legislative, executive, or judicial act to the contrary...\n\nInternational law does not determine which point of view is to be preferred, monism or dualism. Every state decides for itself, according to its legal traditions. International law only requires that its rules are respected, and states are free to decide on the manner in which they want to respect these rules and make them binding on its citizens and agencies.\n\"[T]he transformation of international norms into domestic law is not necessary from the point of view of international law…the necessity of transformation is a question of national, not of international law\".\nBoth a monist state and a dualist state can comply with international law. All one can say is that a monist state is less at risk of violating international rules, because its judges can apply international law directly. Negligence or unwillingness to implement international law in national law can only pose a problem in dualist states. \nStates are free to choose the way in which they want to respect international law, but they are always accountable if they fail to adapt their national legal system in a way that they can respect international law. Either they adopt a constitution that implements a monist system so that international law can be applied directly and without transformation, or they do not. But then they have to translate all international law in national law. \nIn a monist state we rely only on the judges and not on the legislators, but judges can also make mistakes. If a judge in a monist states makes mistakes when applying international law, then the country violates international law just as much as a dualist country that, for one reason or another, does not allow its judges to apply international law directly and fails to translate or fails to translate correctly and effectively. One reason for preferring dualism is precisely the fear that national judges are not familiar with international law - a highly complex field of law - and hence are liable to make mistakes.\n\n"}

It analyzes revolutions through the state-centered perspective.\n\nIn \"No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991\", \nGoodwin offers another comparative study on revolutions focusing on the second half of the twentieth century from 1914 to 1991. According to \nGoodwin, “revolutionary movements are not simply or exclusively a response to economic exploitation or inequality, but also and more directly a response to political oppression and violence, typically brutal and indiscriminate”. This idea is Goodwin’s main thesis throughout the book and he further expands on it. Goodwin believes that understanding revolutions is “worthwhile not only because of the enormous importance of these movements for the national societies in which they occurred, but also for their effects on the configuration of power and beliefs in other societies and thus on the international balance of power as well\". This comparative study on revolutions is worthwhile because it is different from all the others that exist. First, Goodwin uses a unique set of revolutions and revolutionary movements to analyze, making this analysis interesting and very instructive. Second, Goodwin analyzes not only those revolutions that were successful; he also includes failed revolutionary movements that did not succeed. By analyzing these failed revolutions, Goodwin is able to analyze the reasons why some revolutions occur and others simply deteriorate. Goodwin’s goal for his analysis on revolutions is “to discover the general causal mechanics that do the most to explain the origins and trajectory of several important revolutionary movements\". Before beginning to analyze revolutions Goodwin’s guess is that, “the diverse political fortunes of the revolutionary movements in peripheral societies during this era were not fortuitous nor randomly distributed, but were the result of general causal mechanisms” \n(2001:8).\n\nGoodwin offers a definition of several important key terms that he will use throughout his analysis. To commence, he acknowledges that there are two different definitions for revolutions. For the first definition, the term revolution can “refer to any and all instances in which a state or political regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular movement in an irregular, extra constitutional, and/or violent fashion” (Goodwin 2009:9) With this interpretation, there needs to be a mobilization of people against the state. The second definition states that “revolutions entail not only mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic, and/or cultural change during or soon after the struggle for state power” (Goodwin 2001:8). Goodwin chooses the concept from the concept of the first revolution since it is more general and includes many more revolutionary movements.\n\nGoodwin also defines other important terms that will be essential to his theory. Political context is defined as, “the ways in which a national society, or some component of it, is governed and regulated by, has access to, and otherwise relates to the national state as well as to the larger state system” (Goodwin 2001: 14). To Goodwin, political concept is the single most important factor that explains the formation and fate of revolutionary movements. Lastly he defines peripheral state as “a state whose power and projects are more or less strictly determine or at least very tightly constrained by a much more powerful ‘core’ or ‘metropolitan’ state within the state system” (Goodwin 2001:14). Throughout his theory, Goodwin will use these terms in order to further his argument and it is essential to define them correctly.\n\nBefore Goodwin offers his own theory on revolutions, he first discusses two other popular theories, the modernization theory and the Marxist theory. The “modernization theory links revolutions to the transitions from traditional to modern societies, that is, to the very process of modernization itself” (Goodwin 2001:17). Those who believe in the Marxist theory, “view revolutions as occurring in ‘transitional’ societies- only in this case transition which is seen as the result of class struggle, is from one economic mode of production to another” (Goodwin 2001:19-20). Goodwin believes that both of these theories, although not completely wrong, fail to completely analyze the political concept in which they are made. In addition to that there is a lot of disagreement in these theories that makes them less reliable.\n\nThe State-Centered Perspective\nWhen studying revolutions, Goodwin places the focus on states, also known as the state-centered perspective. He focuses on the state because of two main reasons. The first is that any successful revolution will cause the breakdown or incapacitation of the state. The second reason is that “strong revolutionary movements, even if they ultimately fail to seize state power, will emerge only in opposition to states that are configured and that act in certain ways” (Goodwin 2001: 25) There are two reasons why the development of revolutionary movements is dependent on the state. Primarily, people will not support revolutionary movements unless they feel that the state is at fault for their everyday problems. The second reason is that individuals will not join revolutionary movements if they feel that doing so will only lead to more violence from the state. This second reason introduces another idea of people not joining revolutions unless they feel they have no other way out, which is exactly the title of the book. \n\nFour Types of State- Centered Analysis\n\nAnalytic Strengths of State-Centered Approaches to Revolution \n\nCritiques and Limitations of State-Centered Approaches \n\nThe Case of The Cuban Revolution \nThe Cuban Revolution is a clear example that not only shows the strengths of the \nstate-centered perspective, it also shows its limitations. Goodwin explains how in Cuba there were two main reasons as to why Cuba was susceptible to a radical revolution. The first reason was the weakness of Cuba’s clases economicas and the second was its strength of it clases populares or popular sectors. The Cuban state was also characterized by its “mediated sovereignty” and a “near-chronic crisis of political authority” (Goodwin 2001:60). Although the state had a lot to do in the Cuban revolution, this event was also marked by the mobilization of the masses. This is one of the reasons why the state-centered perspective is limited; it fails to analyze certain aspects of the revolution that were very important. On the other hand Goodwin argues that the Cuban revolution needs to be analyzed in different forms in order to fully explain it since no one theory alone can fully analyze any revolution.\n\nThe Formation of Revolutionary Movements in Southeast Asia\n\nThe Only Domino: The Vietnamese Revolution in Comparative Perspective\n\nConclusion \n"}
{"id": "3657390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3657390", "title": "Nous", "text": "Nous\n\nNous (, ), sometimes equated to intellect or intelligence, is a term from classical philosophy for the faculty of the human mind necessary for understanding what is true or real. English words such as \"understanding\" are sometimes used, but three commonly used philosophical terms come directly from classical languages: \"νοῦς\" or \"νόος\" (from Ancient Greek), \"intellēctus\" and \"intellegentia\" (from Latin). To describe the activity of this faculty, the word \"intellection\" is sometimes used in philosophical contexts, as well as the Greek words \"noēsis\" and \"noeîn\" (\"νόησις\", \"νοεῖν\"). This activity is understood in a similar way (at least in some contexts) to the modern concept of intuition.\n\nIn philosophy, common English translations include \"understanding\" and \"mind\"; or sometimes \"thought\" or \"reason\" (in the sense of that which reasons, not the activity of reasoning). It is also often described as something equivalent to perception except that it works within the mind (\"the mind's eye\"). It has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like \"awareness\". In colloquial British English, \"nous\" also denotes \"good sense\", which is close to one everyday meaning it had in Ancient Greece.\nIn Aristotle's influential works, the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception, imagination, and reason, although these terms are closely inter-related. The term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as Parmenides, whose works are largely lost. In post-Aristotelian discussions, the exact boundaries between perception, understanding of perception, and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of Aristotle, even though his terminology remains influential.\n\nIn the Aristotelian scheme, \"nous\" is the basic understanding or awareness that allows human beings to think rationally. For Aristotle, this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception, including the use of imagination and memory, which other animals can do. This therefore connects discussion of \"nous\" to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way, and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same universal categories in the same logical ways. Deriving from this it was also sometimes argued, especially in classical and medieval philosophy, that the individual \"nous\" must require help of a spiritual and divine type. By this type of account, it came to be argued that the human understanding (\"nous\") somehow stems from this cosmic \"nous\", which is however not just a recipient of order, but a creator of it. Such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of God, the immortality of the soul, and even the motions of the stars, in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times.\n\nIn early Greek uses, Homer used \"nous\" to signify mental activities of both mortals and immortals, for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud. It was one of several words related to thought, thinking, and perceiving with the mind. In pre-Socratic philosophy, it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion. For example, Heraclitus complained that \"much learning does not teach \"nous\"\".\n\nAmong some Greek authors, a faculty of intelligence known as a \"higher mind\" came to be considered as a property of the cosmos as a whole.\n\nThe work of Parmenides set the scene for Greek philosophy to come and the concept of \"nous\" was central to his radical proposals. He claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all, because sense perception is so unreliable, and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable. Instead he argued for a dualism wherein \"nous\" and related words (the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity, \"noein\", and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception, \"noēta\") describe a form of perception which is not physical, but intellectual only, distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception.\n\nAnaxagoras, born about 500 BC, is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a \"nous\" (mind), which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order, started them in a rotating motion, and continuing to control them to some extent, having an especially strong connection with living things. (However Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher, Hermotimus of Clazomenae, who had taken a similar position.) Amongst the pre-Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human-like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example, Empedocles, like Hesiod much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love, and Pythagoras and Heraclitus, attributed the cosmos with \"reason\" (\"logos\").\n\nAccording to Anaxagoras the cosmos is made of infinitely divisible matter, every bit of which can inherently become anything, except Mind (\"nous\"), which is also matter, but which can only be found separated from this general mixture, or else mixed into living things, or in other words in the Greek terminology of the time, things with a soul (\"psychē\"). Anaxagoras wrote:\n\nConcerning cosmology, Anaxagoras, like some Greek philosophers already before him, believed the cosmos was revolving, and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of chemical elements. \"Nous\", in his system, originally caused this revolving motion to start, but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started. His description was in other words (shockingly for the time) corporeal or mechanical, with the moon made of earth, the sun and stars made of red hot metal (beliefs Socrates was later accused of holding during his trial) and \"nous\" itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos. This \"nous\" (mind) is not incorporeal; it is the thinnest of all things. The distinction between \"nous\" and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism.\n\nAnaxagoras' concept of \"nous\" was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways, which were also influenced by Eleatic, Pythagorean and other pre-Socratic ideas, as well as the Socratics themselves.\n\nIn some schools of Hindu philosophy, a \"higher mind\" came to be considered a property of the cosmos as a whole that exists within all matter (known as buddhi or mahat). In Samkhya, this faculty of intellect (buddhi) serves to differentiate matter (prakrti) from pure consciousness (purusha). The lower aspect of mind that corresponds to the senses is referred to as \"manas\".\n\nXenophon, the less famous of the two students of Socrates whose written accounts of him have survived, recorded that he taught his students a kind of teleological justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature. This has been described as an \"intelligent design\" argument for the existence of God, in which nature has its own \"nous\". For example, in his \"Memorabilia\" 1.4.8, he describes Socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion, \"Are you, then, of the opinion that intelligence (\"nous\") alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it, while—as you think—those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things [all the earth and water] are in such orderly condition through some senselessness?\" Later in the same discussion he compares the \"nous\", which directs each person's body, to the good sense (\"phronēsis\") of the god, which is in everything, arranging things to its pleasure (1.4.17). Plato describes Socrates making the same argument in his \"Philebus\" 28d, using the same words \"nous\" and \"phronēsis\".\n\nPlato used the word \"nous\" in many ways that were not unusual in the everyday Greek of the time, and often simply meant \"good sense\" or \"awareness\". On the other hand, in some of his Platonic dialogues it is described by key characters in a higher sense, which was apparently already common. In his \"Philebus\" 28c he has Socrates say that \"all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (\"nous\") is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right.\" and later states that the ensuing discussion \"confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (\"nous\") always rules the universe\".\n\nIn his \"Cratylus\", Plato gives the etymology of Athena's name, the goddess of wisdom, from \"Atheonóa\" (Ἀθεονόα) meaning \"god's (\"theos\") mind (\"nous\")\". In his \"Phaedo\", Plato's teacher Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic \"nous\" as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' materialist understanding of causation. Socrates said that Anaxagoras would \"give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other, and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me\". On the other hand, Socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory teleological and dualistic understanding of a mind of nature, whose aims represent the Good, which all parts of nature aim at.\n\nConcerning the \"nous\" that is the source of understanding of individuals, Plato is widely understood to have used ideas from Parmenides in addition to Anaxagoras. Like Parmenides, Plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge, only opinion. Instead, Plato's more philosophical characters argue that \"nous\" must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and daimons perceive. What our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things, but unchanging entities that exist in a different way, the so-called \"forms\" or \"ideas\". However he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued (as in modern science) that \"nous\" and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity, and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding (not the other way around).\n\nJust exactly how Plato believed that the \"nous\" of people lets them come to understand things in any way that improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have, is a subject of long running discussion and debate. On the one hand, in the \"Republic\" Plato's Socrates, in the Analogy of the sun and Allegory of the Cave describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves, something like when the sun shines, helping eyesight. The source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the Form of the Good. On the other hand, in the \"Meno\" for example, Plato's Socrates explains the theory of \"anamnesis\" whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul, which they somehow remember from previous lives. Both theories were to become highly influential.\n\nAs in Xenophon, Plato's Socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way, with ruling parts, and parts that are by nature meant to be ruled. \"Nous\" is associated with the rational (\"logistikon\") part of the individual human soul, which by nature should rule. In his \"Republic\", in the so-called \"analogy of the divided line\", it has a special function within this rational part. Plato tended to treat \"nous\" as the only immortal part of the soul.\n\nConcerning the cosmos, in the \"Timaeus\", the title character also tells a \"likely story\" in which \"nous\" is responsible for the creative work of the demiurge or maker who brought rational order to our universe. This craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal Forms. In the \"Philebus\" Socrates argues that \"nous\" in individual humans must share in a cosmic \"nous\", in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe. And this \"nous\" must be in the \"genos\" of being a cause of all particular things as particular things.\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle saw the \"nous\" or intellect of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct. Sense perception in action provides images to the \"nous\", via the \"sensus communis\" and imagination, without which thought could not occur. But other animals have \"sensus communis\" and imagination, whereas none of them have \"nous\". Aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal-like one which perceives \"species sensibilis\" or \"sensible forms\", and \"species intelligibilis\" that are perceived in a different way by the \"nous\".\n\nLike Plato, Aristotle linked \"nous\" to \"logos\" (reason) as uniquely human, but he also distinguished \"nous\" from \"logos\", thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty that uses them to reason with. In his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Aristotle divides the soul (\"psychē\") into two parts, one which has reason and one which does not, but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning (\"logistikos\") part itself which is lower, and the higher \"knowing\" (\"epistēmonikos\") part which contemplates general principles (\"archai\"). \"Nous\", he states, is the source of the first principles or sources (\"archai\") of definitions, and it develops naturally as people gain experience. This he explains after first comparing the four other truth revealing capacities of soul: technical know how (\"technē\"), logically deduced knowledge (\"epistēmē\", sometimes translated as \"scientific knowledge\"), practical wisdom (\"phronēsis\"), and lastly theoretical wisdom (\"sophia\"), which is defined by Aristotle as the combination of \"nous\" and \"epistēmē\". All of these others apart from \"nous\" are types of reason (\"logos\").\nAristotle's philosophical works continue many of the same Socratic themes as his teacher Plato. Amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality, and \"nous\" is an important part of his explanation. As mentioned above, Plato criticized Anaxagoras' materialism, or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion, but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events. Aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of four causes at the same time. Two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding: each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is, and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change. But at the same time according to Aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become, and the natural ends or aims, which somehow exist in nature as causes, even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved. These latter two causes (the \"formal\" and \"final\"), are concepts no longer used in modern science, and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself. Aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things. It leads to a method whereby Aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the potentialities and actualities of all things, whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end, and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality (something they will do on their own, by nature, unless stopped because of other natural things happening). For example, a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so, and actualize this natural tendency, if nothing is in the way.\n\nAristotle analyzed thinking in the same way. For him, the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between intellect and sense perception. Aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the \"active intellect\" and \"passive intellect\" (along with various other terms) are amongst \"the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy\". The terms are derived from a single passage in Aristotle's \"De Anima\", Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages with some key Greek words shown in square brackets.\n...since in nature one thing is the material [\"hulē\"] for each kind [\"genos\"] (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [\"psychē\"] too that these distinct aspects be present;\nthe one sort is intellect [\"nous\"] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [\"hexis\"] like light too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors [\"to phōs poiei ta dunamei onta chrōmata energeiai chrōmata\"].\nThis sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a being-at-work [\"energeia\"], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.\nKnowledge [\"epistēmē\"], in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.\nThis does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.\n\nThe passage tries to explain \"how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does\" according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality. Aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the intelligible forms of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colours into actual colours. As Davidson remarks:\nJust what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the \"De anima\" and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.\n\nThe passage is often read together with \"Metaphysics\", Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle makes \"nous\" as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos. In that book, Aristotle equates active \"nous\", when people think and their \"nous\" becomes what they think about, with the \"unmoved mover\" of the universe, and God: \"For the actuality of thought (\"nous\") is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal.\" Alexander of Aphrodisias, for example, equated this active intellect which is God with the one explained in \"De Anima\", while Themistius thought they could not be simply equated. (See below.)\n\nLike Plato before him, Aristotle believes Anaxagoras' cosmic \"nous\" implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends: \"Anaxagoras makes the Good a principle as causing motion; for Mind (\"nous\") moves things, but moves them for some end, and therefore there must be some other Good—unless it is as we say; for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health.\"\n\nIn the philosophy of Aristotle the soul (psyche) of a body is what makes it alive, and is its actualized form; thus, every living thing, including plant life, has a soul. The mind or intellect (\"nous\") can be described variously as a power, faculty, part, or aspect of the human soul. It should be noted that for Aristotle soul and \"nous\" are not the same. He did not rule out the possibility that \"nous\" might survive without the rest of the soul, as in Plato, but he specifically says that this immortal \"nous\" does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life. In his \"Generation of Animals\" Aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents, physically, the human \"nous\", must come from outside, into the body, because it is divine or godly, and it has nothing in common with the \"energeia\" of the body. This was yet another passage which Alexander of Aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from \"De Anima\" and the \"Metaphysics\" in order to understand Aristotle's intentions.\n\nUntil the early modern era, much of the discussion which has survived today concerning \"nous\" or intellect, in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, concerned how to correctly interpret Aristotle and Plato. However, at least during the classical period, materialist philosophies, more similar to modern science, such as Epicureanism, were still relatively common also. The Epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error, but the interpretations can be. The term \"prolepsis\" was used by Epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions.\n\nTo the Stoics, more like Heraclitus than Anaxagoras, order in the cosmos comes from an entity called logos, the cosmic reason. But as in Anaxagoras this cosmic reason, like human reason but higher, is connected to the reason of individual humans. The Stoics however, did not invoke incorporeal causation, but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces. As in Aristotelianism, they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas, and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things (\"koine ennoia\"). \"Nous\" for them is soul \"somehow disposed\" (\"pôs echon\"), the soul being somehow disposed \"pneuma\", which is fire or air or a mixture. As in Plato, they treated \"nous\" as the ruling part of the soul.\n\nPlutarch criticized the Stoic idea of \"nous\" being corporeal, and agreed with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while \"nous\" (mind) is more divine than the soul. The mix of soul and body produces pleasure and pain; the conjunction of mind and soul produces reason which is the cause or the source of virtue and vice. (From: “On the Face in the Moon”) \n\nAlbinus was one of the earliest authors to equate Aristotle's \"nous\" as prime mover of the Universe, with Plato's Form of the Good.\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias was a Peripatetic (Aristotelian) and his \"On the Soul\" (referred to as \"De anima\" in its traditional Latin title), explained that by his interpretation of Aristotle, potential intellect in man, that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect, is material, and also called the \"material intellect\" (\"nous hulikos\") and it is inseparable from the body, being \"only a disposition\" of it. He argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality. On the other hand, he identified the active intellect (\"nous poietikos\"), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, not with anything from within people, but with the divine creator itself. In the early Renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by Pietro Pomponazzi against the Thomists and the Averroists. For him, the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought, more specifically when the \"nous\" has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself, or another incorporeal intelligible form.\n\nAlexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect, which became very influential amongst the great Islamic philosophers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes.\n\nThemistius, another influential commentator on this matter, understood Aristotle differently, stating that the passive or material intellect does \"not employ a bodily organ for its activity, is wholly unmixed with the body, impassive, and separate [from matter]\". This means the human potential intellect, and not only the active intellect, is an incorporeal substance, or a disposition of incorporeal substance. For Themistius, the human soul becomes immortal \"as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought\".\n\nThis understanding of the intellect was also very influential for Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, and \"virtually all Islamic and Jewish philosophers\". On the other hand, concerning the active intellect, like Alexander and Plotinus, he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man. Differently from Alexander, he did not equate this being with the first cause of the Universe itself, but something lower. However he equated it with Plato's Idea of the Good.\n\nOf the later Greek and Roman writers Plotinus, the initiator of neoplatonism, is particularly significant. Like Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius, he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. But in his \"Enneads\" he went further than those authors, often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively, possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the neopythagorean Numenius of Apamea. Neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy, theology and cosmology.\n\nIn neoplatonism there exists several levels or \"hypostases\" of being, including the natural and visible world as a lower part.\nThis was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the Unmoved Mover as \"energeia\". They also incorporated a theory of \"anamnesis\", or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls, like that found in some of Plato's dialogues.\n\nLater Platonists distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of \"nous\", like Numenius of Apamea had. Notable later neoplatonists include Porphyry and Proclus.\n\nGreek philosophy had an influence on the major religions that defined the Middle Ages, and one aspect of this was the concept of \"nous\".\n\nGnosticism was a late classical movement that incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism, but which was more a syncretic religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement.\n\nIn Valentinianism, Nous is the first male Aeon. Together with his conjugate female Aeon, Aletheia (truth), he emanates from the Propator Bythos ( \"Forefather Depths\") and his co-eternal Ennoia ( \"Thought\") or Sigē ( \"Silence\"); and these four form the primordial Tetrad. Like the other male Aeons he is sometimes regarded as androgynous, including in himself the female Aeon who is paired with him. He is the Only Begotten; and is styled the Father, the Beginning of All, inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining Aeons who complete the Ogdoad (eight), thence the Decad (ten), and thence the Dodecad (twelve); in all, thirty Aeons constitute the Pleroma.\n\nHe alone is capable of knowing the Propator; but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other Aeons, was withheld from so doing by Sigē. When Sophia (\"Wisdom\"), youngest Aeon of the thirty, was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge, Nous was foremost of the Aeons in interceding for her. From him, or through him from the Propator, Horos was sent to restore her. After her restoration, Nous, according to the providence of the Propator, produced another pair, Christ and the Holy Spirit, \"in order to give fixity and steadfastness () to the Pleroma.\" For this Christ teaches the Aeons to be content to know that the Propator is in himself incomprehensible, and can be perceived only through the Only Begotten (Nous).\n\nA similar conception of Nous appears in the later teaching of the Basilideans, according to which he is the first begotten of the Unbegotten Father, and himself the parent of \"Logos\", from whom emanate successively \"Phronesis\", \"Sophia\", and \"Dunamis\". But in this teaching, Nous is identified with Christ, is named Jesus, is sent to save those that believe, and returns to Him who sent him, after a Passion which is apparent only, Simon of Cyrene being substituted for him on the cross. It is probable, however, that Nous had a place in the original system of Basilides himself; for his \"Ogdoad\", \"the great Archon of the universe, the ineffable\" is apparently made up of the five members named by Irenaeus (as above), together with two whom we find in Clement of Alexandria, \"Dikaiosyne\" and \"Eirene\", added to the originating Father.\n\nThe antecedent of these systems is that of Simon, of whose six \"roots\" emanating from the Unbegotten Fire, \"Nous\" is first. The correspondence of these \"roots\" with the first six \"Aeons\" that Valentinus derives from \"Bythos\", is noted by Hippolytus. Simon says in his \"Apophasis Megalē\",\n\nTo Nous and \"Epinoia\" correspond Heaven and Earth, in the list given by Simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations. The identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by Herodotus to be worshipped by the Persians, together with the supreme place given by Simon to Fire as the primordial power, leads us to look to Iran for the origin of these systems in one aspect. In another, they connect themselves with the teaching of Pythagoras and of Plato.\n\nAccording to the \"Gospel of Mary\", Jesus himself articulates the essence of \"Nous\":\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst Islamic philosophers, who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western Christendom, and the Jewish diaspora in the Mediterranean area. While there were earlier Muslim philosophers such as Al Kindi, chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were Al Farabi, Avicenna, and finally Averroes, a westerner who lived in Spain and was highly influential in the late Middle Ages amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers.\n\nThe exact precedents of Al Farabi's influential philosophical scheme, in which \"nous\" (Arabic \"ʿaql\") plays an important role, are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the Middle Ages which he would have had access to. He was apparently innovative in at least some points. He was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism, neopythagoreanism, but exactly how is less clear. Plotinus, Themistius and Alexander of Aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences. However while these three all placed the active intellect \"at or near the top of the hierarchy of being\", Al Farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences. He is the first known person to have done this in a clear way. He was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of celestial spheres, and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres. Al Farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme, in two levels. According to Davidson (p. 59):The lower of the two levels, labeled specifically as \"prophecy\" (\"nubuwwa\"), is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect, whereas the higher, which Alfarabi sometimes specifically names \"revelation\" (\"w-ḥ-y\"), comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect.\nThis happens in the imagination (Arabic \"mutakhayyila\"; Greek \"phantasia\"), a faculty of the mind already described by Aristotle, which al Farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul (Arabic \"ʿaql\"; Greek \"nous\"). This faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions (\"maḥsūsāt\"), disassembles or recombines them, creates figurative or symbolic images (\"muḥākāt\") of them which then appear in dreams, visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation (\"rawiyya\"). This is under the influence, according to Al Farabi, of the active intellect. Theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form, because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form. This rarely comes in a waking state, but more often in dreams. The lower type of prophecy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty, but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination, but also the condition of an \"acquired intellect\", where the human \"nous\" is in \"conjunction\" with the active intellect in the sense of God. Such a prophet is also a philosopher. When a philosopher-prophet has the necessary leadership qualities, he becomes philosopher-king.\n\nIn terms of cosmology, according to Davidson (p. 82) \"Avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of Alfarabi's\" but there are differences in details. As in Al Farabi, there are several levels of intellect, intelligence or \"nous\", each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere. Avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has, each \"thinks\" both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher. And each \"emanates\" downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere, and also the intellect at the next lowest level. The active intellect, as in Alfarabi, is the last in the chain. Avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the \"sublunar\" world we people live, but also the matter. (In other words, three effects.)\n\nConcerning the workings of the human soul, Avicenna, like Al Farabi, sees the \"material intellect\" or potential intellect as something that is not material. He believed the soul was incorporeal, and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth. As in Al Farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking, which are not yet actual thinking, first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way, such as \"the whole is greater than the part\", then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought. Concerning the actualization of thought, Avicenna applies the term \"to two different things, to actual human thought, irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made, and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete\", as in Al Farabi.\n\nWhen reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from syllogisms, Avicenna says people are using a physical \"cogitative\" faculty (\"mufakkira, fikra\") of the soul, which can err. The human cogitative faculty is the same as the \"compositive imaginative faculty (\"mutakhayyila\") in reference to the animal soul\". But some people can use \"insight\" to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect.\n\nOnce a thought has been learned in a soul, the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary, and as a person acquires more thoughts, their soul becomes less connected to their body. For Avicenna, different from the normal Aristotelian position, all of the soul is by nature immortal. But the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have. Only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body, and this is a supreme \"eudaimonia\". Lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife.\n\nConcerning prophecy, Avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model, which is still similar to that of Al Farabi.\n\nAverroes came to be regarded even in Europe as \"the Commentator\" to \"the Philosopher\", Aristotle, and his study of the questions surrounding the \"nous\" were very influential amongst Jewish and Christian philosophers, with some aspects being quite controversial. According to Herbert Davidson, Averroes' doctrine concerning \"nous\" can be divided into two periods. In the first, neoplatonic emanationism, not found in the original works of Aristotle, was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect. \"It also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect, notions never expressed in the Aristotelian canon.\" It was this presentation which Jewish philosophers such as Moses Narboni and Gersonides understood to be Averroes'. In the later model of the universe, which was transmitted to Christian philosophers, Averroes \"dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically, all in the name of a more genuine Aristotelianism. Yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un-Aristotelian, a single transcendent entity serving all mankind. It nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect, but in words that have little content.\"\n\nThis position, that humankind shares one active intellect, was taken up by Parisian philosophers such as Siger of Brabant, but also widely rejected by philosophers such as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Ramon Lull, and Duns Scotus. Despite being widely considered heretical, the position was later defended by many more European philosophers including John of Jandun, who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from Paris to Bologna. After him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern Italy. In the 16th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an \"Alexandrian\" position based on that of Alexander of Aphrodisias, associated with Pietro Pomponazzi.\n\nThe Christian New Testament makes mention of the \"nous\" or \"noos\", generally translated in modern English as \"mind\", but also showing a link to God's will or law:\n\nIn the writings of the Christian fathers a sound or pure \"nous\" is considered essential to the cultivation of wisdom.\n\nWhile philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early Middle Ages in most of Europe, the works of authors like Boethius and Augustine of Hippo formed an important exception. Both were influenced by neoplatonism, and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the Carolingian Renaissance, and the beginnings of Scholasticism.\n\nIn his early years Augustine was heavily influenced by Manichaeism and afterwards by the Neo-Platonism of Plotinus. After his conversion to Christianity and baptism (387), he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology, accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives.\n\nAugustine used neoplatonism selectively. He used both the neoplatonic \"Nous\", and the Platonic Form of the Good (or \"The Idea of the Good\") as equivalent terms for the Christian God, or at least for one particular aspect of God. For example, God, \"nous\", can act directly upon matter, and not only through souls, and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity, some are treated as angels.\n\nScholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later, as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic Europe. In this period, Aristotle became \"the Philosopher\", and scholastic philosophers, like their Jewish and Muslim contemporaries, studied the concept of the \"intellectus\" on the basis not only of Aristotle, but also late classical interpreters like Augustine and Boethius. A European tradition of new and direct interpretations of Aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of Aristotle from the Islamic world, most notably Averroes' doctrine of their being one \"active intellect\" for all humanity. Notable \"Catholic\" (as opposed to Averroist) Aristotelians included Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, the founder Thomism, which exists to this day in various forms. Concerning the \"nous\", Thomism agrees with those Aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs, but as per Christian doctrine, the whole of the human soul is immortal, not only the intellect.\n\nThe human \"nous\" in Eastern Orthodox Christianity is the \"eye of the heart or soul\" or the \"mind of the heart\". The soul of man, is created by God in His image, man's soul is intelligent and noetic. Saint Thalassius of Syria wrote that God created beings \"with a capacity to receive the Spirit and to attain knowledge of Himself; He has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings\". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this by creating mankind with intelligence and noetic faculties.\n\nHuman reasoning is not enough: there will always remain an \"irrational residue\" which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts: it is this unknowable depth of things, that which constitutes their true, indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in God. In Eastern Christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an objects existence is grasped. Though God through his energies draws us to him, his essence remains inaccessible. The operation of faith being the means of free will by which mankind faces the future or unknown, these noetic operations contained in the concept of insight or \"noesis\". Faith (\"pistis\") is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with \"noesis\" in Eastern Christianity.\n\nAngels have intelligence and \"nous\", whereas men have reason, both \"logos\" and \"dianoia\", \"nous\" and sensory perception. This follows the idea that man is a microcosm and an expression of the whole creation or macrocosmos. The human \"nous\" was darkened after the Fall of Man (which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the \"nous\"), but after the purification (healing or correction) of the \"nous\" (achieved through ascetic practices like hesychasm), the human \"nous\" (the \"eye of the heart\") will see God's uncreated Light (and feel God's uncreated love and beauty, at which point the nous will start the unceasing prayer of the heart) and become illuminated, allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian.\n\nIn this belief, the soul is created in the image of God. Since God is Trinitarian, Mankind is \"Nous\", reason, both \"logos\" and \"dianoia\", and Spirit. The same is held true of the soul (or heart): it has \"nous\", word and spirit. To understand this better first an understanding of Saint Gregory Palamas's teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed. This holds that God is not meant in the sense that the Trinity should be understood anthropomorphically, but man is to be understood in a triune way. Or, that the Trinitarian God is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man, but man is interpreted on the basis of the Trinitarian God. And this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human. This means that it is only when a person is within the revelation, as all the saints lived, that he can grasp this understanding completely (see \"theoria\"). The second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of \"nous\", word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being. Man's \"nous\", word and spirit are not hypostases or individual existences or realities, but activities or energies of the soul - whereas in the case with God or the Persons of the Holy Trinity, each are indeed hypostases. So these three components of each individual man are 'inseparable from one another' but they do not have a personal character\" when in speaking of the being or ontology that is mankind. The \"nous\" as the eye of the soul, which some Fathers also call the heart, is the centre of man and is where true (spiritual) knowledge is validated. This is seen as true knowledge which is \"implanted in the \"nous\" as always co-existing with it\".\n\nThe so-called \"early modern\" philosophers of western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of modern science as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of humanity by learning to control nature. As such, speculation about metaphysics, which cannot be used for anything practical, and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience, started to be deliberately avoided, especially according to the so-called \"empiricist\" arguments of philosophers such as Bacon, Hobbes, Locke and Hume. The Latin motto \"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\" (nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses) has been described as the \"guiding principle of empiricism\" in the \"Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy\". (This was in fact an old Aristotelian doctrine, which they took up, but as discussed above Aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind.)\n\nThese philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations, being interpreted by the brain in a physical way, and nothing else, which means that absolute knowledge is impossible. For Bacon, Hobbes and Locke, who wrote in both English and Latin, \"intellectus\" was translated as \"understanding\". Far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality, Bacon, for example, actually named the \"intellectus\" in his \"Novum Organum\", and the proœmium to his \"Great Instauration\", as a major source of wrong conclusions, because it is biased in many ways, for example towards over-generalizing. For this reason, modern science should be methodical, in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect. He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as Democritus \"who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things\", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein \"the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence\". The intellect or understanding was the subject of Locke's \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\".\n\nThese philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect, describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man-made and resulting from reason itself. Hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason, compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals. In modern science during this time, Newton is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to Leibniz.\n\nOn the other hand, into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in-born (\"a priori\") ability to know the truth conclusively, and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature, and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception. Amongst the early modern philosophers, some such as Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Kant, tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as rationalists, and to some extent at least some of them are called idealists, and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism, and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers.\n\nThe first in this series of modern rationalists, Descartes, is credited with defining a \"mind-body problem\" which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses. According to the presentation his , the human mind and body are different in kind, and while Descartes agrees with Hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism, and its workings include memory and imagination, the real human is the thinking being, a soul, which is not part of that mechanism. Descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason, saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul. Descartes was therefore a dualist, but very much in opposition to traditional Aristotelian dualism. In his he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal, because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal, while his passive faculty must be incorporeal (unless God is deliberately deceiving us, and then in this case the active faculty would be from God). This is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in Alexander of Aphrodisias and discussed above, for whom the passive intellect is material, while the active intellect is not. One result is that in many Aristotelian conceptions of the \"nous\", for example that of Thomas Aquinas, the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions. However, with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by Descartes, it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses, such as a thousand sided geometrical figure. Gassendi objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in Descartes. Hobbes also objected, and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the \"triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen\" and \"essence in so far as it is distinguished from existence is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is\". Descartes, in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is \"known to all\".\n\nHis contemporary Blaise Pascal, criticised him in similar words to those used by Plato's Socrates concerning Anaxagoras, discussed above, saying that \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God.\"\n\nDescartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive, not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside, but because each human mind comes into being with innate God-given ideas, more similar then, to Plato's theory of \"anamnesis\", only not requiring reincarnation. Apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle, another example is the idea of God, according to the 3rd \"Meditation\". Error, according to the 4th \"Meditation\", comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding. This is possible because the human will, being free, is not limited like the human intellect.\n\nSpinoza, though considered a Cartesian and a rationalist, rejected Cartesian dualism and idealism. In his \"pantheistic\" approach, explained for example in his \"Ethics\", God is the same as nature, the human intellect is just the same as the human will. The divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect, because it is finite, but Spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect.\n\nLeibniz, in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above, added some words \"nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu\", nisi intellectus ipsi (\"nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses\" \"except the intellect itself\"). Despite being at the forefront of modern science, and modernist philosophy, in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect, a divine intellect, and the immortality of the active intellect.\n\nBerkeley, partly in reaction to Locke, also attempted to reintroduce an \"immaterialism\" into early modern philosophy (later referred to as \"subjective idealism\" by others). He argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects, not abstractions such as \"matter\", and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence. This belief later became immortalized in the dictum, \"esse est percipi\" (\"to be is to be perceived\"). As in classical and medieval philosophy, Berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention, and that all our ideas are put in our mind by God.\n\nHume accepted some of Berkeley's corrections of Locke, but in answer insisted, as had Bacon and Hobbes, that absolute knowledge is not possible, and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems. Hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards, and are for example considered by Kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber.\n\nKant, a turning point in modern philosophy, agreed with some classical philosophers and Leibniz that the intellect itself, although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin, needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information. In his formulation the intellect (\"Verstand\") has \"a priori\" or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts. Kant represents the starting point of German idealism and a new phase of modernity, while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond Hume to the present day.\n\nOne of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science, in areas that were once considered part of philosophy, and infant cognitive development and perception now tend to be discussed now more within the sciences of psychology and neuroscience than in philosophy.\n\nModern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist, and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of genetic and developmental factors which allow the mind to develop. Overall it accepts far less innate \"knowledge\" (or clear pre-dispositions to particular types of knowledge) than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus and Al Farabi.\n\nApart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject, contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely.\n\nClassical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology. There is also still discussion of classical nous in non-mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism, such as Noetics, promoted for example by the Institute of Noetic Sciences.\n\n"}

{"id": "779445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779445", "title": "Pak Protector", "text": "Pak Protector\n\nPak Breeders and Pak Protectors are two developmental stages of fictional life in Larry Niven's Known Space universe. The Pak first appeared in \"The Adults,\" which appeared in \"Galaxy\" in 1967; this story was expanded into the novel \"Protector\" by Larry Niven (1973). The Pak also appear in several of Niven's later novels, notably those set in the Ringworld.\n\n\"Destroyer of Worlds\" depicts a confrontation between the Pak and the Puppeteers.\n\nNiven has written that he invented the Protectors as a thought experiment to explain the common effects of aging on humans and to create a fictional evolutionary explanation for humans' long lives after females have passed reproductive age. Accordingly, most of the positive attributes of Protectors are based on negative human aging effects: swollen joints, decreased muscle-fat ratio, weakening heart, invariant diet, decreasing height, facial atrophy, leathery skin, hair loss, lack of sex drive, and tooth loss are all turned to advantage during the shift from Breeder to Protector.\n\nIn \"Protector\", we learn that humans are descended from the Pak. Pak Children and Breeders appear in Earth's fossil record as \"Homo habilis\"; the few Pak Protectors to make it to Earth apparently are not found in the fossil record.\n\nThe Pak species goes through three stages of development: Child, Breeder and Protector.\n\nPak Child is analogous to a human child: sexually immature and dependent upon adults for survival.\n\nPak Breeder is analogous to a human adult: sexually mature, self-sufficient (in later writings) and provides immediate care for the children. To the Pak, the Breeder stage, though capable of space travel, is not deemed fully sentient; Breeders, to a large extent, rely on Protectors for long-term survival. Earlier Niven stories describe the breeder as \"just intelligent enough to swing a club or throw a stone.\"\n\nPak Protector is not analogous to any human form. It is described as a 'fighting machine,' with armor-like skin, super-human strength and super-human intelligence. Niven's stories that focus on the Pak mostly concentrate on the unique Protector-stage.\n\nNiven explained the evolution of the Pak as resulting from high radiation levels on their home world near the core of the galaxy. The high radiation near the star-dense core caused severe mutations that can destabilize the evolutionary process. As a result, the Pak evolved a mechanism to eliminate dangerous mutations from the population. That mechanism is the protector stage.\n\nProtectors are highly sensitive to the smell of their close relatives and \"weed out\" those that smell wrong, which may indicate a potentially dangerous mutation. This weeding also suppressed positive mutations, essentially halting Pak evolution. Protectors are fully sentient, and are far more intelligent than ordinary humans. This \"superior\" intelligence, however, serves only a Pak Protector's instincts to protect its bloodline at any costs. The Pak have no drive toward the collection of \"abstract knowledge,\" have no concept of \"art,\" and do not even possess enough of an \"artistic impulse\" to understand the purpose of making sketches and paintings for reasons not directly useful.\n\nThe change from Breeder to Protector is the result of a peramorphic transformation brought about by the plant known as Tree-of-Life. As humans (and all primates) are descended from the Pak, Tree-of-Life can create a Protector-stage human.\n\nTree-of-Life is the mechanism by which a Breeder becomes a Protector. The term originally is used to refer to a specific plant which, when consumed, triggers the transformation. The term \"Tree-of-Life virus\" is used to describe the symbiotic virus which actually governs the transition.\n\nNiven took the name Tree-of-Life from the Book of Genesis; specifically to the fruit of the \"Tree of Life\" that could make Adam and Eve immortal (Genesis 3:22-24), which is quoted as the foreword to the novel \"Protector\", and also mentioned by Brennan within the novel.\n\nTree-of-Life (the plant) is a bush native to the Pak homeworld. When a Breeder reaches the proper age (early 40s for humans), the smell of the root becomes irresistible; the Breeder gorges on the Tree-of-Life root, infecting itself with the Tree-of-Life virus and transforming into a Protector. The age window for the metamorphosis is relatively narrow (between 42 and 50 Earth years). Tree-of-Life is common on the Pak world, so there is almost no risk of a Breeder living past this window without being exposed to the roots.\n\nThe transition from Breeder to Protector involves reconfiguration of the anatomy. Skin thickens, becoming similar to leather armor, strong enough to turn a copper knife. Joints swell until the creature becomes \"a parody of the human form done in cantaloupes and coconuts\". This increases leverage available to muscles by increasing the force of the moment arm, the result being that a protector can lift ten times its own weight. Genitalia and gonads vanish, and a second two-chambered heart forms in the groin at the fusion of the femoral veins. The arms lengthen. Fingernails turn into retractable claws. Teeth fall out and the lips and gums fuse, the mouth forming a horny beak (flat in protectors transformed from humans, non-flat in protectors transformed from Pak). All the breeder's hair falls out and the head acquires a bony ridge to protect the newly expanded cranium. The expanded skull allows the brain to grow to an enormous size; the resulting mind, even starting from something as \"unintelligent\" as a chimpanzee, becomes far more intelligent than a typical human. Pak Protectors also acquire an extended lifespan, and can live tens of thousands of Earth years (a common element in Niven's stories).\n\nOnce the transformation is complete, a Pak Protector must periodically consume more Tree-of-Life root to maintain the virus in its body. Without the virus, a Protector will weaken and die as its DNA is degraded; the virus supplies replacement DNA.\n\nThe Tree-of-Life crop on Earth failed due to there being insufficient thallium oxide in the Earth's soil; the plants grew but didn't support the virus. As a result, the Protectors that led the colony to Earth died of starvation when their store of roots ran out.\n\nPak Protectors have an innate need to protect close relatives. When a Pak Protector has no bloodline to protect, it usually stops eating and starves; some childless Protectors can adopt the entire Pak race as their family.\n\nNiven states that Protectors on the crowded Pak homeworld would constantly war against each other to gain advantage for their family and that alliances would last only until one ally sees advantage in betrayal. Human Protectors, and those on the Ringworld, seem to be less warlike and better able to work for the betterment of the entire species (or all of the Ringworld hominids) rather than just their bloodline, though this may simply be a function of how few protectors with families encounter each other.\n\nProtectors typically die from starvation (from lack of will to live, e.g. if the Protector's bloodline has died out) or violence. Although Protectors have a vastly extended lifetime, it is not infinite; during the original half million year journey to Earth some protector colonists did die from old age.\n\nBecause of their enormous intelligence and instinctive need to protect their family (or their species, etc.), Protectors are efficient, ruthless and quite amoral. It is observed several times that this intelligence combined with instinct also compels action so completely that Protectors often have little \"free will\". Niven uses this trait as a plot device several times as characters set up circumstances where Protector characters will react in a specific manner. In \"Protector\", Jack Brennan (a human turned into a Protector) commits genocide by exterminating the Martian race (\"Aliens were dangerous, or might be, and Pak were not interested in anything but Pak\") and also releases a genetically modified Tree-of-Life virus on the colony world Home, turning everyone middle aged into a Protector (and killing all other humans on the planet) in order to create an army of childless Protectors with which to fight the invading Pak fleet. It is indicated throughout Niven's works that humans (\"Homo sapiens\") that have turned into protectors are far more intelligent than their Pak (\"Homo habilis\") counterparts (in much the way that humans are more intelligent than the primates they evolved from).\n\nNiven explains much of Protector behavior in his Future History, by revealing in \"Ringworld's Children\" that the ARM may be run by at least one Protector and that Boosterspice (which dramatically prolongs human lifespan) is derived from Tree-of-Life.\n\nIn \"Protector,\" Niven explains that humans (and all of Earth's primates) are descended from a colony of Pak breeders that were stranded on Earth 2.5 million years ago. The protectors that built the colony ship died when their Tree-of-Life crops failed. The original Pak Breeder population (known to us as \"Homo habilis\") bred and mutated wildly, evolving into modern humans as well as all other Earth primates. All Terran primates would transform into the Protector stage if exposed to Tree-of-Life root (or, more accurately, the symbiotic virus it contains).\n\nIn \"The Ringworld Engineers,\" the characters find evidence that the Ringworld was built by Pak Protectors (confirmed by the statements of a character in \"Ringworld's Children\" who claims to be one of the original builders) and populated by Pak breeders. The Pak Protectors dwindled in numbers until they were no longer able to maintain the genetic purity of the breeder forms and the breeders eventually evolved into all the other hominids of the Ringworld that one sees in Larry Niven's novels.\n\nIn \"Destroyer of Worlds\" (co-written by Niven and Edward M. Lerner), a human world (and the Pierson's Puppeteers of the Fleet of Worlds) confronts a Pak Protector war fleet. The trailing edge of that Pak fleet, carrying the primary Pak Library, also figures prominently in \"Betrayer of Worlds\", by the same authors.\n\n\n"}

Wilson's concept is largely based on speculation, although he admits to adding a bit of fantasy to the idea. In Wilson's view, these pirate enclaves were early forms of autonomous proto-anarchist societies in that they operated beyond the reach of governments and embraced unrestricted freedom.\n\nLocated on the Barbary Coast (Salé, Algiers and Tunis), these bases were havens for renegade Muslim pirates from the 16th to the 18th century. The pirates, dubbed \"Barbary Corsairs\", ravaged European shipping operations and enslaved many thousands of captives. However, thousands of Europeans also converted to Islam, forming the \"Renegados\" and joining the pirate holy war. Wilson writes that these men and women were not only apostates and traitors, as they were considered in their homelands, but their voluntary betrayal of Christendom can also be thought of as a praxis of social resistance. Wilson focuses on the Pirate Republic of Salé, in 17th century Morocco, which may have had its own lingua franca. Like some other pirate states, it even used to pass treaties from time to time with some European countries, agreeing not to attack their fleets. Wilson/Bey's idea of Temporary Autonomous Zones developed from his historical review of pirate utopias. When describing them Wilson says \"We've certainly had to use our imagination more than a \"real\" historian would allow, erecting a lot of suppositions on a shaky framework of generalizations, and adding a touch of fantasy (and what piratologist has ever been able to resist fantasy?). I can only say that I've satisfied my own curiosity at least to this extent: That something like a Renegado culture could have existed; that all the ingredients for it were present, and contiguous, and synchronic.\"\n\nLibertatia (also known as Libertalia) was a possibly fictional anarchist colony founded in the late 17th century in Madagascar by pirates under the leadership of Captain James Misson. Whether or not Libertatia actually existed is disputed. It is described in the book \"A General History of the Pyrates\" by Captain Charles Johnson, an otherwise unknown individual who may have been a pseudonym of Daniel Defoe. Much of the book is a mixture of fact and fiction, and it is possible the account of Libertatia is entirely fabricated.\n\nAccording to Johnson's description, Libertatia lasted for about 25 years. The precise location is not known, however, most sources say it stretched from the Bay of Antongil to Mananjary, including Île Sainte Marie and Foulpointe. Thomas Tew, Misson, and an Italian Dominican priest named Caraccioli were involved in founding it.\n\n\"Cities of the Red Night\", a novel by American author William S. Burroughs, revolves around a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by Captain James Misson.\n\nThe attempted establishment of a Republic of Pirates utopia (free from either British or Spanish rule) is a significant plot element in the Ubisoft video game \"\".\n\nIn the movie \"\" the main characters gather at \"Shipwreck Cove\", a city built out of wrecked ships and constructed platforms. \n\nLibertalia is also a central plot element and setting in the video game \"\". However, in this interpretation, Libertalia was founded by the pirate Henry Avery and others including Tew, Anne Bonny and Edward England.\n\nThe 2015 video game \"Fallout 4\" features an area in the game called Libertalia. The area is a series of off-shore platforms (made of various debris) that has become home to a large gang of raiders.\n\n\n\n"}

As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at Harvard Law School, PON includes faculty, students, and staff from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University.\n\nThe Program on Negotiation publishes the quarterly \"Negotiation Journal\" and the monthly \"Negotiation Briefings\" newsletter, and distributes the annual \"Harvard Negotiation Law Review\". Throughout the year PON offers a number of courses and training opportunities ranging in length from one day to an entire semester.\n\nIn 1979, co-authors of the bestseller \"Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement without Giving In\", Roger Fisher and William Ury, along with Bruce Patton founded the Harvard Negotiation Project (HNP), with a mission to improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution, so that people could deal more constructively with conflicts ranging from the interpersonal to the international. Fisher began by asking the question of what kind of advice could be given to both sides of a dispute, and in researching this question he came in contact with various professors, including James Sebenius, Lawrence Susskind, Frank Sander, and Howard Raiffa, who collaborated to form the Program on Negotiation.\n\nThe Program on Negotiation was founded in 1983 as the world's first teaching and research center dedicated to negotiation and dispute resolution. As an umbrella organization with founding members from both Harvard and MIT, it soon expanded to include Tufts University as one of its consortium schools. Since the beginning, the Program on Negotiation has been multi-disciplinary, with scholars from economics, government, law, business, psychology, anthropology, education, and the arts. Faculty have focused on a wide range of research topics, including deal-making, diplomatic negotiations, international negotiations, psychological aspects of negotiations, decision-making, issues relating to ethics and trust, and labor negotiations.\n\nChair of the Program on Negotiation since 1994, Professor Robert H. Mnookin is Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. Among his recent publications are the books, \"Beyond Winning: Negotiating to Create Value in Deals and Disputes\", and \"Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight\".\n\nThe Program on Negotiation is responsible for multiple publications, including books, special reports, the \"Negotiation Briefings\" newsletter and the quarterly \"Negotiation Journal\", a multidisciplinary international journal published by Wiley-Blackwell detailing the latest advances in the field. PON also regularly produces free reports that are available through their website, such as: \"Teaching Negotiation: Understanding The Impact Of Role-Play Simulations\", \"Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals\", \"Negotiation Skills: Negotiation Strategies and Negotiation Techniques to Help You Become a Better Negotiator\", \"Dealmaking: Secrets of Successful Dealmaking in Business Negotiations\", \"Negotiation Strategies for Women: Secrets to Success\", \"Dealing with Difficult People\", \"BATNA Basics: Boost Your Power at the Bargaining Table\", \"Sally Soprano: Role-Play Simulation\", \"Harborco: Role-Play Simulation\", and \"Win-Win or Hardball: Learn Top Strategies from Sports Contract Negotiations\". All of PONs publications including books, case studies, and DVDs can be obtained through the PON Clearinghouse.\n\nPON offers a number of training programs throughout the year on a variety of topics including negotiation, mediation, conflict resolution, deal design, difficult conversations, and many more. PON seminars and courses are open to the public.\n\nThe Program on Negotiation offers one day Author Sessions focused on recent book publications by PON faculty members as part of its Executive Education Series. Recent courses included: Deal-Making and Negotiauctions, Creating a World-class Negotiating Organization, Bargaining with the Devil, and Negotiating International Deals.\n\nExecutive Education courses last for three days, covering strategies for business leaders to handle both successful day-to-day management and long-term strategies for healthy workplace environments. Executives learn tactics for dealing with dirty tricks, threats, attacks, and stonewalls from the other side of the table.\n\nHarvard Negotiation Institute (HNI) classes are offered every June and September on the Harvard Law School campus and cover a broad range of negotiation and mediation skills, ranging from beginning to advanced techniques. Most of the courses offered are five-day classes. However, a 2-day Intensive Negotiation Workshop for Lawyers and Working Professionals is also offered. Recent course offerings included: a mediation workshop, Creating Value in Deals and Disputes, Tools for Preparing and Negotiating Effectively, Deal Design and Implementation, and Difficult Conversations.\n\nOpen to participants from all disciplines and professional fields, the PON Seminars provide negotiation and mediation courses to the community. These semester-length courses are designed to increase public awareness and understanding of successful conflict resolution efforts.\n\nTwo courses are taught each year: Negotiation and Dispute Resolution in the fall, and Mediation and Conflict Management in the spring. Both courses provide participants with a conceptual framework and practical advice for professional and personal development in dispute resolution. Faculty is drawn from the PON community of scholars and practitioners of alternative dispute resolution.\n\nThe Program on Negotiation also hosts a variety of smaller workshops and intensive two-day courses in addition to their normal course offerings, including on-site training.\n\nThe Program on Negotiation established the Great Negotiator Award in 2000 to honor individuals of extraordinary achievement in dispute resolution. The award is designed not only to honor the accomplishments of outstanding negotiators, but also to focus public attention on the important role of negotiation as society faces increasingly complex disputes in all sectors–public and private, technological and ethical, personal and professional. PON has recognized a diverse cast of distinguished negotiators from their respective fields: Juan Manuel Santos, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and President of Colombia (2017); Martti Ahtisaari, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and former President of Finland (2010); Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the artists who created The Gates in Central Park (2008); Bruce Wasserstein, Chairman and CEO of Lazard, an international financial advisory and asset management firm (2007); Sadako Ogata, former United Nations high commissioner for refugees (2005); Richard Holbrooke, former United States ambassador to the United Nations (2004); Stuart Eizenstat, former U.S. ambassador to the European Union (2003); Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations’ special envoy for Afghanistan (2002); Charlene Barshefsky, U.S. trade representative in the second Clinton administration (2001); and former U.S. Senator George Mitchell for his work in Northern Ireland (2000).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1301785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1301785", "title": "Pseudocertainty effect", "text": "Pseudocertainty effect\n\nIn prospect theory, the pseudocertainty effect is the tendency for people to perceive an outcome as certain while it is actually uncertain. It can be observed in multi-stage decision making, in which evaluation of the certainty of the outcome in a previous stage of decisions is disregarded when selecting an option in subsequent stages. Not to be confused with certainty effect, the pseudocertainty effect was discovered from an attempt at providing a normative use of decision theory for the certainty effect by relaxing the cancellation rule.\n\nThe pseudocertainty effect was illustrated by Daniel Kahneman, who received the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on decision making and decision theory, in collaboration with Amos Tversky. The studies that they researched used real and hypothetical monetary gambles and were often used in undergraduate classrooms and laboratories. Kahneman and Tversky illustrated the pseudocertainty effect by the following examples.\n\nConsider the following two stage game. In the first stage, there is a 75% chance to end the game without winning anything and a 25% chance to move into the second stage. If you reach the second stage, you have a choice between:\n\nWhich of the following options do you prefer?\n\n\nYour choice must be made before the game starts, i.e., before the outcome of the first stage is known. Please indicate the option you prefer.\n\nWhich of the following options do you prefer?\n\n\nAlso, this time the participants had to make their choice before the game starts.\n\nEach problem was answered by a different group of respondents. In problem 1, people preferred option A with a rate of 74% over option B with 26%. In problem 2, people preferred option D with a rate of 58% over option C with a rate of 42%. However, the discrepancy between the answers were surprising because the two problems were designed to have identical outcomes. The choices in problem 2 were designed to be compressed forms of the choices from the two stages of problem 1.\n\n(25% chance to move on x 100% = 25%) chance to win $30\n\n(25% chance to move on x 80% = 20%) chance to win $45\n\nKahneman and Tversky referred to this incidence as a result of what they called the \"pseudocertainty effect\". They concluded that when people make choices at later stages of problems they often do not realize that uncertainty at an earlier stage will affect the final outcome. This was clearly observed in the two stage problem shown above in which the problem moved onto the second stage only if the condition of the first stage was met.\n\nIn the second problem, since individuals have no choice on options in the first stage, individuals tend to discard the first option when evaluating the overall probability of winning money, but just to consider the options in the second stage that individuals have a choice on. This is also known as cancellation, meaning that possible options are yielding to the same outcome thus ignoring decision process in that stage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7506128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7506128", "title": "Retrocausality", "text": "Retrocausality\n\nRetrocausality or Backwards causation is a concept of cause and effect where the effect precedes its cause in time, so a later event in time can affect an earlier event in time. In quantum physics, the distinction between cause and effect is not made at the most fundamental level, so time-symmetric systems can be viewed as causal or retro-causal. Philosophical considerations about the nature of time and causality often involve time travel and address the same issues as retrocausality, as do treatments of the subject in fiction, but the two terms are not universally synonymous.\n\nPhilosophical efforts to understand causality extend back at least to Aristotle's discussions of the four causes. It was long considered that an effect preceding its cause is an inherent self-contradiction because, as 18th century philosopher David Hume discussed, when examining two related events, the cause, by definition, is the one that precedes the effect.\n\nIn the 1950s, Michael Dummett wrote in opposition to such definitions, stating that there was no philosophical objection to effects preceding their causes. This argument was rebutted by fellow philosopher Antony Flew and, later, by Max Black. Black's \"bilking argument\" held that retrocausality is impossible because the observer of an effect could act to prevent its future cause from ever occurring. A more complex discussion of how free will relates to the issues Black raised is summarized by Newcomb's paradox. Essentialist philosophers have proposed other theories, such as proposing the existence of \"genuine causal powers in nature\" or by raising concerns about the role of induction in theories of causality.\n\nThe ability to affect the past is sometimes taken to suggest that causes could be negated by their own effects, creating a logical contradiction such as the grandfather paradox. This contradiction is not necessarily inherent to retrocausality or time travel; by limiting the initial conditions of time travel with consistency constraints, such paradoxes and others are avoided.\n\nAspects of modern physics, such as the hypothetical tachyon particle and certain time-independent aspects of quantum mechanics, may allow particles or information to travel backward in time. Jan Faye of the University of Copenhagen has argued that logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction. Even if such effects are possible, however, they may not be capable of producing effects different from those that would have resulted from normal causal relationships.\nThe Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, proposed by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman, uses retrocausality and a temporal form of destructive interference to explain the absence of a type of converging concentric wave suggested by certain solutions to Maxwell's equations. These advanced waves don't have anything to do with cause and effect: they are simply a different mathematical way to describe normal waves. The reason they were proposed is so that a charged particle would not have to act on itself, which, in normal classical electromagnetism, leads to an infinite self-force.\n\nFeynman, and earlier Ernst Stueckelberg, proposed an interpretation of the positron as an electron moving backward in time, reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive electric charge. Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that \"they are all the same electron\" with a complex, self-intersecting world line. Yoichiro Nambu later applied it to all production and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that \"the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past.\" The backwards-in-time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures, but it doesn't have anything to do with the macroscopic terms \"cause\" and \"effect\", which do not appear in a microscopic physical description.\n\nClosed timelike curves, in which the world line of an object returns to its origin, arise from some exact solutions to the Einstein field equation. Although closed timelike curves do not appear to exist under normal conditions, extreme environments of spacetime, such as a traversable wormhole or the region near certain cosmic strings, may allow their formation, implying a theoretical possibility of retrocausality. The exotic matter or topological defects required for the creation of those environments have not been observed. Furthermore, Stephen Hawking has suggested a mechanism he describes as the chronology protection conjecture, which would destroy any such closed timelike curve before it could be used. These objections to the existence of closed timelike curves are not universally accepted.\n\nRetrocausality is sometimes associated with the nonlocal correlations that generically arise from quantum entanglement, including the notable special case of the delayed choice quantum eraser. However, verifying nonlocal correlations requires ordinary subluminal communication: the no communication theorem prevents the superluminal transfer of information, and fundamental descriptions of matter and forces require the full framework of quantum field theory in which spacelike-separated operators commute. Accounts of quantum entanglement that do not involve retrocausality emphasize how the experiments demonstrating these correlations can equally well be described from different reference frames, that disagree on which measurement is a \"cause\" versus an \"effect\", as necessary to be consistent with special relativity. The description of such nonlocal quantum entanglements can be described in a way that is manifestly free of retrocausality if the states of the system is considered. Ongoing experiments by physicist John G. Cramer explore various proposed methods for nonlocal or retrocausal quantum communication, finding them all flawed and unable to transmit nonlocal signals.\n\nRetrocausality is also associated with the two-state vector formalism (TSVF) in quantum mechanics, where the present is characterised by quantum states of the past and the future taken in combination.\n\nHypothetical superluminal particles called tachyons have a spacelike trajectory, and thus can appear to move backward in time, according to an observer in a conventional reference frames. Despite frequent depiction in science fiction as a method to send messages back in time, tachyons do not interact with normal tardyonic matter in a way that would violate standard causality. Specifically, the Feinberg reinterpretation principle means that ordinary matter cannot be used to make of a tachyon detector capable of receiving information.\n\nParapsychologist Helmut Schmidt presented quantum mechanical justifications for retrocausality, eventually claiming that experiments had demonstrated the ability to manipulate radioactive decay through retrocausal psychokinesis. These results and their underlying theory have been rejected by the mainstream scientific community, although they continue to have some support from fringe science sources.\n\nEfforts to associate retrocausality with prayer healing have been similarly discounted by legitimate scientific method.\n\nIn an experiment by psychologist Daryl J. Bem, a subject was shown two sets of curtains, and was instructed to guess which one had a picture behind it, but the picture was not displayed behind the curtain until after the subject made their guess. Most of the results were statistically indistinguishable from chance (50%), but some results showed a higher margin of success (p. 17) for a subset of erotic images — 53.1%. Subjects which identified as \"stimulus-seeking\" in the pre-screening questionnaire scored even higher — 57.6%. However its methodology has been strongly criticised.\n\n"}

Over a long period of time, the term was corrupted and idiomized to \"robin\".\n\nIn a \"single round-robin\" schedule, each participant plays every other participant once. If each participant plays all others twice, this is frequently called a \"double round-robin\". The term is rarely used when all participants play one another more than twice, and is never used when one participant plays others an unequal number of times (as is the case in almost all of the major United States professional sports leagues – see AFL (1940–41) and All-America Football Conference for exceptions).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a round-robin tournament is often called an American tournament in sports such as tennis or billiards which usually have knockout tournaments. In Italian it is called (literally \"Italian-style circuit\"). In Serbian it is called the Berger system (, ), after chess player Johann Berger.

Most association football leagues in the world are organized on a double round-robin basis, in which every team plays all others in its league once at home and once away. This system is also used in qualification for major tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup and the continental tournaments (e.g. UEFA European Championship, CONCACAF Gold Cup). There are also round-robin bridge, chess, draughts, go, curling and Scrabble tournaments. The World Chess Championship decided in 2005 and in 2007 on an eight-player double round-robin tournament where each player faces every other player once as white and once as black.\n\nGroup tournaments rankings usually go by number of matches won and drawn, with any of a variety of tiebreaker criteria.\n\nFrequently, pool stages within a wider tournament are conducted on a round-robin basis. Examples with single round-robin scheduling include the FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Football Championship, and UEFA Cup (2004–2009) in football, Super Rugby (rugby union) in the Southern Hemisphere during its past iterations as Super 12 and Super 14 (but \"not\" in its later 15- and 18-team formats), the Cricket World Cup, Indian Premier League Twenty-20 Cricket, The International (Dota 2) and many American Football college conferences, such as the Big 12 (which currently has 10 members). The group phases of the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores de América are contested as a double round-robin, as are most basketball leagues outside the United States, including the regular-season and Top 16 phases of the Euroleague; the United Football League has used a double round-robin for both its 2009 and 2010 seasons.\n\nSeason ending tennis tournaments also use a round robin format prior to the semi on stages\n\nIn theory, a round-robin tournament is the fairest way to determine the champion from among a known and fixed number of participants. Each participant, whether player or team, has equal chances against all other opponents. The element of luck is seen to be reduced as compared to a knockout system since one or two bad performances need not cripple a competitor's chance of ultimate victory. Final records of participants are more accurate as they represent the results over a longer period against the same opposition. This can also be used to determine which teams are the poorest performers and thus subject to relegation if the format is used in a multi-tiered league. This is also helpful to determine the final rank of all competitors, from strongest to weakest, for purposes of qualification for another stage or competition as well as for prize money. In team sport the (round-robin) major league champions are generally regarded as the \"best\" team in the land, rather than the (elimination) cup winners.\n\nMoreover, in tournaments such as the FIFA or ICC world cups, a first round stage consisting of a number of mini round robins between groups of 4 teams guards against the possibility of a team travelling possibly thousands of miles only to be eliminated after just one poor performance in a straight knockout system. The top one, two, or occasionally three teams in these groups then proceed to a straight knockout stage for the remainder of the tournament.\n\nRound-robins can suffer from being too long compared to other tournament types, and with later scheduled games potentially not having any substantial meaning. They may also require tiebreaking procedures.\n\nSwiss system tournaments attempt to combine elements of the round-robin and elimination formats, to provide a worthy champion using fewer rounds than a round-robin, while allowing draws and losses.\n\nThe main disadvantage of a round robin tournament is the time needed to complete it. Unlike a knockout tournament where half of the participants are eliminated after each round, a round robin requires one round less than the number of participants if the number of participants is even, and as many rounds as participants if the number of participants is odd. For instance, a tournament of 16 teams can be completed in just 4 rounds (i.e. 15 matches) in a knockout format; a round-robin would require 15 rounds (i.e. 120 matches) to finish. Other issues stem from the difference between the theoretical fairness of the round robin format and practice in a real event. Since the victor is gradually arrived at through multiple rounds of play, teams who perform poorly, who might have been quickly eliminated from title contention, are forced to play out their remaining games. Thus games are played late in the competition between competitors with no remaining chance of success. Moreover, some later matches will pair one competitor who has something left to play for against another who does not. It may also be possible for a competitor to play the strongest opponents in a round robin in quick succession while others play them intermittently with weaker opposition. This asymmetry means that playing the same opponents is not necessarily completely equitable: the same opponents in a different order may play harder or easier matches, while other teams are presented with more adversity during periods of the competition. There is also no scheduled showcase final match. Only by coincidence would two competitors meet in the final match of the tournament where the result of that match determined the championship. A notable instance of such an event was the May 26th, 1989 match between Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\nFurther issues arise where a round-robin is used as a qualifying round within a larger tournament. A competitor already qualified for the next stage before its last game may either not try hard (in order to conserve resources for the next phase) or even deliberately lose (if the scheduled next-phase opponent for a lower-placed qualifier is perceived to be easier than for a higher-placed one). Four pairs in the 2012 Olympics Women's doubles badminton, having qualified for the next round, were disqualified for attempting to lose in the round robin stage to avoid compatriots and better ranked opponents. The round robin stage at the Olympics were a new introduction and potential problems were readily known prior to the tournament.\n\nAnother disadvantage, especially in smaller round-robins, is the \"circle of death,\" where teams cannot be separated on a head-to-head record. In a three-team round-robin, where A defeats B, B defeats C, and C defeats A, all three competitors will have a record of one win and one loss, and a tiebreaker will need to be used to separate the teams. This famously happened during the 1994 FIFA World Cup Group E, where all four teams finished with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss.\n\nIf formula_1 is the number of competitors, a pure round robin tournament requires formula_2 games. If formula_1 is even, then in each of formula_4 rounds, formula_5 games can be run concurrently, provided there exist sufficient resources (e.g. courts for a tennis tournament). If formula_1 is odd, there will be formula_1 rounds, each with formula_8 games, and one competitor having no game in that round.\n\nThe circle method is the standard algorithm to create a schedule for a round-robin tournament. All competitors are assigned to numbers, and then paired in the first round:\nNext, one of the contributors in the first or last column of the table is fixed (number one in this example) and the others rotated clockwise one position\n\nThis is repeated until you end up almost back at the initial position:\n\nIf there are an odd number of competitors, a dummy competitor can be added, whose scheduled opponent in a given round does not play and has a bye. The schedule can therefore be computed as though the dummy were an ordinary player, either fixed or rotating. Instead of rotating one position, any number relatively prime to formula_9 will generate a complete schedule.\nThe upper and lower rows can indicate home/away in sports, white/black in chess, etc.; to ensure fairness, this must alternate between rounds since competitor 1 is always on the first row. If, say, competitors 3 and 8 were unable to fulfil their fixture in the third round, it would need to be rescheduled outside the other rounds, since both competitors would already be facing other opponents in those rounds. More complex scheduling constraints may require more complex algorithms.\nThis schedule is applied in chess and draughts tournaments of rapid games, where players physically move round a table. In France this is called the Carousel-Berger system (Système Rutch-Berger).\n\nThe schedule can also be used for \"asynchronous\" round-robin tournaments where all games take place at different times (for example, because there is only one venue). The games are played from left to right in each round, and from the first round to the last. When the number of competitors is even, this schedule performs well with respect to quality and fairness measures such as the amount of rest between games. On the other hand, when the number of competitors is odd, it does not perform so well and a different schedule is superior with respect to these measures.\n\nAlternatively Berger tables, named after the Austrian chess master Johann Berger, are widely used in the planning of tournaments. Berger published the pairing tables in his two Schachjahrbucher, with due reference to its inventor Richard Schurig.\n\nThis constitutes a schedule where player 14 has a fixed position, and all other players are rotated clockwise formula_10 positions. This schedule alternates colours and is easily generated manually. To construct the next round, the last player, number 8 in the first round, moves to the head of the table, followed by player 9 against player 7, player 10 against 6, until player 1 against player 2. Arithmetically, this equates to adding formula_10 to the previous row, with the exception of player formula_1. When the result of the addition is greater than formula_9, then subtract formula_14.\n\nThis schedule can also be represented as a (n-1, n-1) table, expressing a round in which players meets each other. For example, player 7 plays against player 11 in round 4. If a player meets itself, then this shows a bye or a game against player n. All games in a round constitutes a diagonal in the table.\n\nThe above schedule can also be represented by a graph, as shown below:\nBoth the graph and the schedule were reported by Édouard Lucas in as a recreational mathematics puzzle.\nLucas, who describes the method as \"simple and ingenious\", attributes the solution to Felix Walecki, a teacher at Lycée Condorcet. Lucas also included an alternative solution by means of a sliding puzzle.\n\nFor 7 or 8 players, Schurig builds a table with formula_15 vertical rows and formula_16 horizontal rows, as follows:\nThen a second table is constructed (with counting from the end) as shown below: \nBy merging above tables we arrive at:\nThen the first column is updated: if formula_1 is even, player number formula_1 is alternatingly substituted for the first and second positions, whereas if formula_1 is odd a bye is used instead.\n\nThe pairing tables were published as an annex concerning the arrangements for the holding of master tournaments.\nSchurig did not provide a proof nor a motivation for his algorithm.

{"id": "9769425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9769425", "title": "Social perception", "text": "Social perception\n\nSocial perception (or person perception) is the study of how people form impressions of and make inferences about other people as sovereign personalities. People learn about others' feelings and emotions by picking up information they gather from physical appearance, verbal, and nonverbal communication. Facial expressions, tone of voice, hand gestures, and body position or movement are just a few examples of ways people communicate without words. A real-world example of social perception is understanding that others disagree with what one said when one sees them roll their eyes. There are four main components of social perception: observation, attribution, integration, and confirmation.\n\nObservations serve as the raw data of social perception—an interplay of three sources: persons, situations, and behavior. These sources are used as evidence in supporting a person's impression or inference about others. Another important factor to understand when talking about social perception is attribution. Attribution is expressing an individual's personality as the source or cause of their behavior during an event or situation. To fully understand the impact of personal or situational attributions, social perceivers must integrate all available information into a unified impression. To finally confirm these impressions, people try to understand, find, and create information in the form of various biases. Most importantly, social perception is shaped by an individual's current motivations, emotions, and cognitive load capacity. Cognitive load is the complete amount of mental effort utilized in the working memory. All of this combined determines how people attribute certain traits and how those traits are interpreted.\n\nThe fascination and research for social perception date back to the late 1800s when social psychology was first being discovered. As more and more research on social perception is done, the realization of its significance in understanding and predicting our social world continues to grow. This overview article aims to inform readers about the processes of social perception along with brief descriptions to relevant and related theories.\n\nThe processes of social perception begin with observing persons, situations, and behaviors to gather evidence that supports an initial impression.\n\nAlthough society tries to train people not to judge others based on their physical traits, as social perceivers, we cannot help but be influenced by others' hair, skin color, height, weight, style of clothes, pitch in voice, etc., when making a first impression. People have the tendency to judge others by associating certain facial features with specific personality types. For example, studies indicate that people are perceived as stronger, more assertive, and competent if they have small eyes, low eyebrows, an angular chin, wrinkled skin, and a small forehead. People tend to associate baby-faced people with impotence and harmlessness.\n\nPeople are able to easily predict the sequences or results of an event based on the extent and depth of their past experiences with a similar event. The ability to anticipate the outcomes of a situation is also greatly influenced by an individual's cultural background because this inevitably shapes the types of experiences. Situational observations either lead humans to have preset notions about certain events or to explain the causes of human behaviors.\n\nNonverbal communication helps people express their emotions, attitudes, and personalities. The most dominant form of nonverbal communication is the use of facial expressions to channel different emotions. Greatly influenced by Charles Darwin's research on facial expressions and book \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)\", it is believed that all humans, regardless of culture or race, encode and decode the six \"primary\" emotions, (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), universally in the same way. To encode means to communicate nonverbal behavior, while to decode means to interpret the meaning or intention of the nonverbal behavior. Decoding sometimes is inaccurate due to affect blend, (a facial expression with two differently registered emotions), and/or display rules, (culturally dictated rules about which nonverbal behaviors are acceptable to display). Other nonverbal cues such as: body language, eye contact, and vocal intonations can affect social perception by allowing for thin-slicing. Thin-slicing describes the ability to make quick judgements from finding consistencies in events based only on narrow frames of experience.\n\nWith the observations drawn from persons, situations, and behavior, the next step is to make inferences that identify an individual's inner dispositions.\n\nA large component of social perception is attribution. Attribution is the use of information gathered through observation to help individuals understand and rationalize the causes of one's own and others' behaviors. Psychological research on attribution began with the work of Fritz Heider in 1958, and was subsequently developed by others such as Harold Kelley and Bernard Weiner. People make attributions to understand the world around them in order to seek reasons for an individual's particular behavior. When people make attributions they are able to make judgments as to what was the cause or causes of a certain behavior. Attribution theory is the study of what systems and models people implement to make attributions about the behavior of others. It attempts to explain how we use information about the social environment to understand others' behavior.\n\nOne common bias people exhibit in attribution is called the fundamental attribution error. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to attribute others' actions or behaviors to internal traits as opposed to external circumstances. An example of how this may manifest in the real world as pointed out in research by Furnham and Gunter is how one's view of the justness of poverty may be affected by one's financial status: one who has not experienced poverty may see it as being more or less deserved than might someone who has been impoverished at some point. In this way, fundamental attribution error can be a barrier to empathizing with others, as one does not consider all the circumstances involved in the actions of others.\n\nUnlike conventional attribution theories, the two-step process of attribution suggests that people analyze others' behaviors first by automatically making an internal attribution and only then considering possible external attributions that may affect the initial inference. Heider's most valuable contribution to the topic of attribution is the dichotomy: When attempting to decide why individuals behave a certain way, we can make either an internal or external attribution. Internal attribution, (also called dispositional attribution or personal attribution), is the assumption that an individual is acting a certain way due to something about that individual, such as personality, character, or attitude. External attribution, also called situational attribution, is the inference that an individual is acting a certain way due to the situation he or she is in; the assumption is that most individuals would respond in the same way in that similar situation. Essentially, people first assume that a person's behavior is due to his or her personality, and then attempt to modify this attribution by also factoring in the person's situation.\n\nAccording to Edward Jones and Keith Davis's correspondent inference theory, people learn about other individuals from behavior that is chosen freely, that is not anticipated, and that results in a small number of favorable outcomes. There are three factors that people use as a basis for their inferences:\n\nAccording to American social psychologist Harold Kelley, individuals make attributions by utilizing the covariation principle. The covariation principle claims that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a certain behavior occurs and the factors that are absent when it does not occur. There are three types of covariation information that are particularly helpful: consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency.\n\nIf a single individual and a large majority of individuals behave similarly in reaction to a specific stimulus, then the individual's behavior is attributed to the stimulus and is high in consensus. The individual's behavior due to this specific stimulus should be compared to the individual's behavior in reaction other stimuli within the same broader category. This helps judge whether the level of distinctiveness information is high, and thus attributed to the stimulus. Lastly, consistency information is used to see what happens to the behavior at another time when the individual and the stimulus both remain unchanged.\n\nUnless a snap judgement is made from observing persons, situations, or behavior, people integrate the dispositions to form impressions.\n\nNorman H. Anderson, an American social psychologist, developed the information integration theory in 1981. The theory states that impressions are made from the perceiver's personal dispositions and a weighted average of the target individual's characteristics. The differences among perceivers are due to people using themselves as a standard, or frame of reference, when judging or evaluating others. People also tend to view their own skills and traits as favorable for others to also have. These impressions formed about others can also be influenced by the current, temporary mood of the perceiver. A concept called, priming also affects a perceiver's impressions of others. Priming is the tendency for recently perceived or implemented concepts or words to come to mind easily and influence the understanding of the new information. Trait information also impacts people's impressions of others, and psychologist Solomon Asch was the first to discover that the existence of one trait tends to indicate the existence of other traits. Asch claimed that central traits exist that exert a strong effect on the perceiver's overall impressions. Lastly, the sequence in which a trait is realized can also influence the trait's impact. Research shows that there is a tendency for information presented at the beginning of a sequence to have a greater effect on impressions than information presented later on, a concept called primacy effect.\n\nImplicit personality theory is a type of model people use to group various kinds of personality qualities together. Put in another way, implicit personality theories describe the way an observer uses the traits displayed by another person to form impressions about that other person. People pay attention to a variety of cues, including: visual, auditory, and verbal cues to predict and understand the personalities of others, in order to fill in the gap of the unknown information about a person, which assists with social interactions.\n\nCertain traits are seen as especially influential in the formation of an overall impression of an individual; these are called central traits. Other traits are less influential in impression formation, and are called peripheral traits. Which traits are central or peripheral is not fixed, but can vary based on context. For instance, saying that a person is warm versus cold may have a central impact on an individual's impression formation when paired with traits such as \"industrious\" and \"determined\", but have a more peripheral impact when paired with traits such as \"shallow\" or \"vain\".\n\nKim and Rosenberg demonstrate that when forming impressions of others, individuals assess others on an evaluative dimension. Which is to say that, when asked to describe personality traits of others, individuals rate others on a \"good-bad\" dimension. People's implicit personality theories also include a number of other dimensions, such as a \"strong-weak\" dimension, an \"active-passive\" dimension, an \"attractive-unattractive\" dimension, etc. However, the evaluative \"good-bad\" dimension was the only one that universally appeared in people's descriptions of others, while the other dimensions appeared in many, but not all, people's assessments. Thus, the dimensions included in implicit personality theories on which others are rated vary from person to person, but the \"good-bad\" dimension appears to be part of all people's implicit personality theories.\n\nAfter making and integrating attributions, individuals form impressions that are subject to confirmation biases and the threat of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIt is true that people fall for the biases identified by social psychologists and for some biases that may have not yet been identified. Despite these misjudgments, there are four reasons that soundly demonstrate people's competence as social perceivers: \n\nThe accuracy of social perception relates to the connection between judgments people make of others' psychological attributes, and the reality of those attributes with regards to the people being judged. There are three slightly varying approaches to interpreting accuracy the: pragmatic, constructivist, and realistic approaches. Empirical research suggests that social perception is mostly accurate, but the degree of accuracy is based on four major moderator variables. These moderators are attributes of the: judge, target, trait that is judged, and information on which the judgment is based. The Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM) explains that these moderators are a result of the process for accurate judgment. The process of accurate personality judgment starts with the target revealing relevant information, which then must be available to a judge, who then identifies and uses it to form a final judgment.\n\nWhile accurate social perception is important, it has also been rather neglected. It is difficult to provide a set list of criteria that can be checked-off as accuracy can be subjective in nature. In the past, there was an assumption that people’s judgements were also considered erroneous and often mistaken. As such, many researchers have chosen to pursue other facets of research instead. It was not until these assumptions were proved incorrect through research and research methods became more sophisticated that genuine effort was put into analyzing accurate social perceptions.\n\nTASIT (The Awareness of Social Inference Test) is an audiovisual test that In the past for the clinical assessment of social perception. The test is based upon several critical components of social perception that are crucial for social competence using complex, dynamic, visual, and auditory cues to assess these critical components. The test assesses the ability to identify emotions, a skill that is impaired in many clinical conditions. It also assesses the ability to judge what a speaker may be thinking or what their intentions are for the other person in the conversation, also referred to as theory of mind. Lastly, the test was developed to assess the ability to differentiate between literal and non-literal conversational remarks. The test is divided into three parts to measure; emotion, social inference – minimal, and social inference enriched. The test is composed of scenes, or vignettes, and those being assessed are asked to identify the emotions, a, feelings, beliefs, intentions, and meanings of the interactions. They are also assessed on more complex interactions to assess ability to interpret sarcasm. The results of this testing assess the level of social perception of an individual.\n\nTASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT provides useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena.\n\nPeople are prone to numerous types of confirmation biases—tendencies to construe, find, and formulate information in ways that prove existing opinions. Preconceived prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination otherwise known as social biases can contribute towards these tendencies. People are also subject to exhibiting belief perseverance, the tendency to hold false convictions even after they have been disproved.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, a statite would use the solar sail to \"hover\" in a location that would not otherwise be available as a stable geosynchronous orbit. Statites have been proposed that would remain in fixed locations high over Earth's poles, using reflected sunlight to counteract the gravity pulling them down. Statites might also employ their sails to change the shape or velocity of more conventional orbits, depending upon the purpose of the particular statite.\n\nThe concept of the statite was invented independently (and approximately simultaneously) by Robert L. Forward (who coined the term \"statite\"), and by Colin McInnes, who used the term \"halo orbit\" (not to be confused with the type of halo orbit invented by Robert Farquhar). Subsequently, the terms \"non-Keplerian orbit\" and \"artificial Lagrange point\" have been used as a generalization of the above terms.\n\nNo statites have been deployed to date, as solar sail technology is still in its infancy. NASA's cancelled Sunjammer solar sail mission had the stated objective of flying to an artificial Lagrange point near the Earth/Sun L1 point, to demonstrate the feasibility of the Geostorm geomagnetic storm warning mission concept proposed by NOAA's Patricia Mulligan.\n\n"}
{"id": "2871881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2871881", "title": "Street harassment", "text": "Street harassment\n\nStreet harassment is a form of sexual harassment that consists of unwanted comments, gestures, honking,\nwolf-whistlings, catcalling, exposure, following, persistent sexual advances, and touching by strangers in public areas such as streets, shopping malls, and public transportation. According to the founder of the non-profit organization \"Stop Street Harassment\", it can also consist of physically harmless behavior, such as \"kissing noises\" and \"non-sexually explicit comments,\" to \"more threatening behavior\" like stalking, flashing, sexual assault, and rape.\n\nRecipients include people of all genders, but women are much more commonly victims of harassment by men. According to \"Harvard Law Review\" (1993), street harassment is considered harassment done primarily by male strangers to females in public places. In 2014, researchers from Cornell University and Hollaback! conducted the largest international cross-cultural study on street harassment. The data suggests that the majority of females have their first street harassment experience during puberty.\n\nIn much of South Asia, public sexual harassment of women is called \"eve teasing\". The Spanish term \"piropos\" most widely used in Mexico holds a similar effect. Studies show that what is considered street harassment is similar around the globe. Many perpetrators of these actions would not characterize them as harassment, though most recipients would. Harassment can also be disproportionately directed at those with what is perceived by passers-by as a non-typical gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nTaking photos of strangers without permission, as street photography and photojournalism practitioners do, is not considered street harassment.\n\nThere is no definitive beginning of street harassment, but discussion regarding the subject began in 1944 with the rape of Recy Taylor. Rosa Parks was commissioned to investigate the crime in which Taylor, a black woman, was kidnapped and gang raped in Abbeville, Alabama. Parks responded by starting what was later dubbed the \"strongest campaign for equal justice to be seen in a decade.\"\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a movement called Take Back the Night gained traction. This movement, still strongly represented today, is an international protest against sexual violence against women. Take Back the Night has become a non-profit organization that aims to end all forms of sexual violence, including street harassment.\n\nIn 1970, the \"Wall Street Ogle-In\" took place. Led by Karla Jay, women marched on Wall Street with signs addressing street harassment. As a role reversal, the women catcalled the men they passed in hopes of raising awareness of the unpleasant nature of the street harassment women experience daily.\n\nIn 1994, Deirdre Davis wrote an academic article that helped clarify what street harassment is by explaining its five characteristics: 1) it takes place in a public space, 2) it most commonly occurs between men and women, 3) saying \"thank you\" to a harasser provokes further harassment, 4) comments often pertain to what cannot be seen on the woman's body, and 5) the harasser's comments, though disguised as compliments, are objectifying and derogatory.\n\nIn 2012, the blog \"Stop Street Harassment\" became a non-profit that is \"dedicated to documenting and ending gender-based street harassment worldwide\" by hosting events and keeping people informed about action they can take to end street harassment.\n\nThere is a high prevalence for street harassment to become sexual violence. Worldwide, statistics show that 80% of women endure at least frequent street harassment, 45% feel that they cannot go alone to public spaces, 50% have to cross the street to find alternate routes to their destinations, 26% claim that they are in a relationship in order to avoid harassment, 80% feel the need to be constantly alert when traversing local streets and 19% have had to switch careers to escape the area in which harassment occurred. This problem is not only transnational, but also transcultural and affects people of all identities, races, and ages—everyday.\n\nThe Canadian government sponsored a large survey in 1993 called the Violence Against Women Survey. In the sample of over 12,000 women, 85% said they were victims of harassment by a stranger. In a 2002 survey of Beijing residents, 58% cited public buses as a common location for sexual harassment.\n\nA study done in Australia shows that almost 90% of women have experienced verbal or physical harassment in public one or more times in their lives. In Afghanistan, research done in the same year indicates that the prevalence of harassment was 93%. Canadian and Egyptian studies show that the rate of incidence is approximately 85% of women experiencing street harassment in the past year. In U.S.-based research, it was reported that women experienced stranger harassment on a monthly basis (41%), while a large minority reported experiencing harassment once every few days (31%). These statistics are given to show a sense of the phenomenon as widely construed, not taken as representative of the same phenomenon comparable across contexts.\n\nA representative survey of 2,000 Americans was commissioned in 2014 by activist group Stop Street Harassment and conducted by GfK. 65% of women and 25% of men reported having been the victims of street harassment in their lives. 41% of women and 16% of men said they had been physically harassed in some way, such as by being followed, flashed, or groped. The perpetrators are lone men in 70% of cases for female victims and 48% of cases for male victims; 20% of men who were harassed were the victims of a lone woman. For men, the most common harassment was homophobic or transphobic slurs, followed by unwanted following, then catcalling and comments on body parts. For women, the most common harassment was catcalling, followed by comments on body parts, unwanted touching or brushing up against, and then sexual slurs like \"bitch\" or \"slut\".\n\nFor women, most harassment is performed by a total stranger. This comes from a 1990s study from the American Midwest. It was found that numerous women have experienced street harassment on numerous occasions. Another 50% were physically harassed or followed by such strangers. Half of those surveyed revealed this harassment occurred by their 17th birthday.\n\nA 2008 survey found that 83% of Egyptian women said they had experienced sexual harassment, as did 98% of women from overseas while in Egypt. A 2013 study in Egypt by UN Women found that 99.3% of female respondents said they had been sexually harassed.\n\nFive hundred cases of mass sexual assault in Egypt were documented between June 2012 and June 2014.\n\n66% of LGBT respondents in a 2012 European Union survey said that they avoid holding hands in public for fear of harassment and assault. 50% said they avoid certain places or locations, and the places they listed as most unsafe to be open about their sexual orientations were \"public transport\" and \"street, square, car parking lot, or other public space.\"\n\nAccording to the Stop Street Harassment national survey, LGBT men are 17% more likely to experience physically aggressive harassment and 20% more likely to encounter verbal harassment than heterosexual men. In a separate survey, verbal harassment was cited as the most common form of abuse. However, there were also a significant number of people who were harassed by being denied service or being physically harassed.\n\nA sample survey of 331 LGBTQ men in 2014 indicated the phenomena occurs worldwide. 90% of them claimed to be harassed in public spaces for their perceived differences. It was mainly their lack of traditionally masculine features that singled them out for abuse. This abuse was mainly aimed at how they did not fit typical gender roles while in public.\n\nA study in 2011 was aimed at recording the health effects of street harassment on women and girls. It was found that they were mentally stressed after experiencing street harassment. Poor mental health has been found to be linked to street harassment in addition to paranoia that certain spaces are not safe. The main way the women and girls put a stop to this was reducing the amount of time they spent on the street. However, this negatively impacted their ability to hold down a job or go to where they could receive healthcare.\n\nA 2000 article, based on Canada's Violence Against Women Survey, showed that past exposure to harassment from strangers is an important factor in women's perceptions of their safety in public. Harassment from a stranger, as opposed to an acquaintance, is more likely to induce fear of sexual victimization.\n\nA study published in 2010 reported that \"the experience of street harassment is directly related to a greater preoccupation with physical appearance and body shame, and is indirectly related to heightened fears of rape. ... Stranger harassment reduces feelings of safety while walking alone at night, using public transportation, walking alone in a parking garage, and while home alone at night.\"\n\nIn some cases, men may enjoy the thrill of doing something illegal or taboo, and some may experience sexual gratification from groping, flirting, or sexual humiliation. Negative remarks can also be the result of transphobia or homophobia.\n\nAustralian reporter Eleanor Gordon-Smith recorded interactions in the 2010s in Kings Cross, New South Wales, and found that men who catcalled women enjoyed getting attention, flirting, and the public performance. The men were also under the impression that the women who were the subject of their remarks and gestures enjoyed the attention and believed they were helping the women have a good time or were giving a compliment about physical appearance that would be appreciated. The vast majority of women in the area, in contrast, found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault. Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack.\n\nYouGov conducted a poll of about 1,000 Americans in August 2014. In their findings, 72% said it was never appropriate to make a \"catcall\", 18% said it was sometimes appropriate to catcall, and 2% said it was always acceptable. The majority (55%) labelled catcalling \"harassment\", while 20% called it \"complimentary\". Americans in the 18–29 age range were the most likely to categorize catcalling as complimentary.\n\nThe vast majority of women in the Kings Cross area study found such conduct degrading, wished they could avoid it, and worried that it could escalate into a physical assault. In a more representative sample, a 2014 U.S. survey found that 68% of harassed women and 49% of harassed men were \"very or somewhat concerned\" the situation would escalate. Gordon-Smith pointed out that pretending to enjoy the attention was one way to avoid provoking an escalation which could lead to a physical attack. The U.S. survey found 31% of women responded by going out with other people instead of alone, and 4% of all victims made a major life change to avoid harassment, like moving or quitting a job.\n\nThe mainstream media, including any printed, televised, social media or other online information sources, commonly represent sexual and street harassment using overly simplified narratives and delegitimizing language. There exists a tendency in media portrayals of the issue that harassment occurs as a reflection of individual aberration, usually highlighting aspects of misconduct by one party against another. While humanities and feminist scholarship identify any degree of sexual harassment as a manifestation of gendered oppression and discrimination in society, seldom do mainstream media sources report that harassment derives from systemic gender inequality or introduce dialogue in the context of broader issues.\n\nAnother way that mainstream media shapes the public opinion of harassment is by incorporating conservative messages to their audiences, specifically through the use of invalidating rhetoric. As with other forms of oppression against women, the language presented by media sources commonly undermines the validity of street harassment complaints. The particular overuse of the words, \"alleged,\" \"supposed,\" \"expected,\" immediately create a sense of uncertainty toward claims of harassment and assault, therefore imposing a sense of responsibility and/or guilt on to the victim.\n\nWhile the internet, social media specifically, allows a new platform for activism against street harassment, it has become a source of frequent verbal harassment against users. Harassment that victims may face in real life on the streets translates to the online public forum of Twitter. In a case study following a hashtag originating in November 2011, #mencallmethings, primarily female Twitter users posted and discussed examples of the harassment they received online from men. However, over the course of this trending hashtag, tweets that were meant to educate, share stories, and create a sense of togetherness between victims often received backlash from the male Twitter user population, demonstrating that on an unmonitored media source women's voices on harassment are again silenced.\n\nWhile internet \"trolling\" (defined as aggressive online behavior) is prevalent across several internet circles, the manifestation of gendered society which normalizes street harassment, result in a specific type of Internet aggression that feminist scholars label as \"gendertrolling.\" Gendertrolling is thought to be a more threatening form of social media presence, one that aligns with the responses to the #mencallmethings posts. What allows gendertrolling to become destructive to its victims are the prescriptive signs of gender-based insults, hate speech, credible threats, unusual intensity, scope, longevity of attacks, and reaction to women speaking out, all which are similar features of street harassment.\n\nPublic activism against street harassment has grown since the late 2000s. A group called Stop Street Harassment began as a blog in 2008 and became incorporated as a non-profit organization in 2012. The organization provides tips for dealing with street harassment in safe and assertive ways, as well as provide opportunities to \"take community action\". In 2010, Stop Street Harassment started the annual \"International Anti-Street Harassment Week\". During the third week in April, people from around the globe participated in \"marches, rallies, workshops, and sidewalk chalkings\" in an effort to gain attention for the issue. Another group called Hollaback! was founded in 2010.\n\nActivists have made use of viral videos to publicize the frequency of unsolicited comments that women receive in public areas.\n\nOne American street artist used Kickstarter to raise money for a campaign called \"Stop Telling Women to Smile.\" The artist posts portraits of herself and other young women accompanied with messages against street harassment.\n\nA Minneapolis woman created a set of printable \"Cards Against Harassment\" (in homage to the game \"Cards Against Humanity\") that she distributes to street harassers. The cards are meant to explain to street harassers why their comments are unwanted.\n\nThe Safe Cities Global Initiative created by UN-Habitat in 1996 is an approach to address harassment in public places through partnerships with cities’ communities, local organizations, and municipal governments. Actions taken to address this include improved street designs and lighting in urban areas. The United Nations Commission of the Status of Women (CSW), a subcategory under UN Women, is committed to empowering women and advocating for gender equality. For the first time, it included multiple clauses into their \"Agreed Conclusions\" that focused on sexual harassment in public places in March 2013.\n\nA 2016 study in \"The\" \"British Journal of Criminology\" examines the extent to which online sites serve as a form of informal justice for street harassment victims. The results show that individuals experience “validation” or “affirmation” after self-disclosing their experiences online and may receive acknowledgement or support by doing so. Notably, some individuals feel re-victimized or experience re-traumatization. It was found that online justice is limited, but in particular for street harassment, it is possible that victims achieve some form of justice.\n\nIn some jurisdiction there are laws that make some forms of street harassment illegal. Peru has had anti-street harassment laws since March 2015.\n\nQuezon City in the Philippines, which has a high rate of street harassment, implemented an ordinance against street harassment, such as cat-calling and wolf-whistling, on May 16, 2016. Penalties for acts of street harassment include fines of Php 1,000 to Php 5,000 and a 1-month jail term.\n\nAcross the United States, laws regarding street harassment are under the jurisdiction of individual states. In Illinois there are laws that relate to street harassment.\n\nDespite being a potential precursor to physical assault and even murder, offensive speech and hate speech are protected under the First Amendment. Although a perpetrator is legally allowed to shout obscenities, other acts such as public indecency and sexual assault are blatant violations of the law. Offensive speech and hate speech as forms of street harassment are frequently used as evidence against repeat offenders.\n\nThe public's rejection of criminalizing offensive speech and hate speech in view of the First Amendment poses a challenge for the legal system. Contrary to popular belief, it is not just those who are unaffected by street harassment that hold this ideal; victims and survivors of offensive speech and hate speech are reluctant to advocate against this First Amendment right. Adversely, the public is hesitant to rely on the law in their daily lives as they prefer autonomy, regardless of how grave the situation may be.\n\nNot only is there a sense of powerlessness when being victimized during street harassment, but also during the legal process. More often than not, plaintiffs are unprepared for litigation and the courtroom as they are inexperienced, to no fault of their own. Quite frequently, plaintiffs are victims of legal aggression via their street harassment perpetrator. Perpetrators will file a frivolous lawsuit in response to their victim's charges. In addition to this, it is difficult to acquire government aid, as seen in the 1994 case when the EEOC received 11,000 harassment complaints and prosecuted fifty.\n\nIn a series of interviews conducted by Laura Beth Nielson in 2000, regarding the attitudes of the public in relation to the law and street harassment, four paradigms were offered. The freedom of speech paradigm is based on the ideal of allegiance to the First Amendment's supposed ideology. The autonomy paradigm is based on the desire for self-governance. The impracticality paradigm is based on the impossibility of regulation in regards to offensive speech and hate speech. Lastly, the distrust of authority paradigm is based on the lack of faith in legal officials to enforce laws. These four paradigms exemplify the reasoning behind the lack of criminalization for street harassment.\n\n\n"}

Untargeted surveillance is routinely accused of treating innocent people as suspects in ways that are unfair, of violating human rights, international treaties and conventions as well as national laws and of failing to pursue security effectively.\n\nA 2014 report to the UN General Assembly by the United Nations' top official for counter-terrorism and human rights condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core privacy rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions and makes a distinction between \"targeted surveillance\" - which \"depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization\" — and \"mass surveillance\", by which \"states with high levels of Internet penetration can [...] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular websites\".\n\nThe United Kingdom's House of Lords also distinguishes between these two broad types of surveillance:\nOnly targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including terrorism, is justified, according to a decision by the European Court of Justice.\n\n\nThe current approach of the NSA and its related organizations is attempting to collect all signals of everybody at all times without any prior selection. So any current selection is only used for targets of special interest, human review or special resource allocation.\n\nSuch selectors include searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools such as Tor.\n\nA leaked document revealed that for the XKeyscore program using language out of place for the region one is in, using encryption and searching the web for 'suspicious stuff' were suggested as selectors.\n\nSelectors for who to surveil and for what to look for in searches for unknown threats as well as their extents can be decided upon by society. Verifiable public consent on broad selectors and their extents as well as proper mechanisms and institutions for oversight may allow for a better cooperation of private sectors and citizens with their intelligence communities.\n\nIn Operation Eikonal German BND agents received \"Selector Lists\" − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets. These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project as well as French administration, which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.\n\nThe BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a \"person of trust\" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-paged report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude. While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states. Klaus Landefeld, member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.\n\nFormer NSA director and whistleblower William Binney testified that while targeted data collection operations could help prevent terror attacks, \"overcollection\" of mass data undermined security and had consistently cost lives because of \"analysis paralysis\". He said the UK government should \"redirect\" intelligence agencies and law enforcement to targeted surveillance with it being \"based on probable cause and developing knowledge about the targets and make sure they qualify for things like warrants\". He also states that \"retroactively analysing people, anybody you want, any time you want, that's certainly possible with bulk acquisition of data but that's certainly not what democracies are built on\". According to him \"that's what totalitarian states are built on\".\n\nIn November 2016 whistleblower Edward Snowden states:\nSnowden also noted that the men who committed recent terrorist attacks in France, Canada and Australia were under surveillance but they weren't singled out.\nIn May 2015 \"The Intercept\" revealed that it obtained documents that showed that officials inside the NSA have criticized the 'collect it all'-approach as well with the documents having titles such as \"Data Is Not Intelligence\", \"The Fallacies Behind the Scenes\", \"Cognitive Overflow?\", \"Summit Fever\", \"In Praise of Not Knowing\", \"Dealing With a 'Tsunami' of Intercept\", \"Overcome by Overload?\" and \"Too Many Choices\".\n\nThe documents feature conclusions such as:\nThe SIGINT mission is far too vital to unnecessarily expand the haystacks while we search for the needles. Prioritization is key.\nWe in the agency are at risk of a similar, collective paralysis in the face of a dizzying array of choices every single day\n'Analysis paralysis' isn’t only a cute rhyme. It's the term for what happens when you spend so much time analyzing a situation that you ultimately stymie any outcome [...] It's what happens in SIGINT when we have access to endless possibilities, but we struggle to prioritize, narrow, and exploit the best ones.\n\nUnited Kingdom's Liberal Democrats have demanded that the Government ends indiscriminate mass surveillance and introduces a more targeted and effective counter-terrorism policy that uses targeted surveillance of specific individuals who are suspected of wrongdoing. Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael asks that \"mass spying on the British people should be replaced with targeted surveillance of specific individuals suspected of wrongdoing\".\n\nIn the 2015 \"Resolution 2045\" the European Parliamentary Assembly \"recognises the need for effective, targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists and other organised criminal groups\" and states that \"such targeted surveillance can be an effective tool for law enforcement and crime prevention\", while at the same time \"according to independent reviews carried out in the United States, mass surveillance does not appear to have contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks, contrary to earlier assertions made by senior intelligence officials. Instead, resources that might prevent attacks are diverted to mass surveillance, leaving potentially dangerous persons free to act\".\n\nPrivacy campaigners argue that instead of \"wasting resources gathering and sifting through the volume of data being accumulated through mass surveillance\", resources would be better allocated in providing more personnel for targeted surveillance.\n\nIn an analysis of 10 recent terror attacks Ryan Gallagher of \"The Intercept\" concludes that \"if any lesson can be learned from studying the perpetrators of recent attacks, it is that there needs to be a greater investment in conducting targeted surveillance of known terror suspects and a move away from the constant knee-jerk expansion of dragnet surveillance, which has simply not proven itself to be effective, regardless of the debate about whether it is legal or ethical in the first place\".\n\nAfter Privacy International launched a legal case against Britain's security services Thomas de la Mare QC of the group states there is a danger that \"de facto constant surveillance\" such as the services' orders for bulk data from telecom companies on request could become \"the most potent instrument of repression\" and argued during the hearing, that such non-targeted forms of surveillance have turned investigations on their head. The campaigners argue that whereas in the past, individual inquiries based on suspicion would throw up leads, it is now algorithmic processing of data providing those leads with that amounting to mass surveillance.\n\nCivil rights group Liberty, which is challenging the legality of bulk collection in the European Court of Human Rights criticizes the \"Report of the bulk powers review\" by David Anderson QC for failing to answer whether information gathered via bulk powers was the \"critical factor in preventing or detecting serious crime, and whether that information could have been obtained from smart, targeted surveillance instead\".\n\nLord Paddick comments the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, saying \"as with any legislation, there is a significant risk that authorities will use powers in a way that parliament never intended\" and called for proper oversight to ensure any surveillance is targeted and proportionate.\nPrivacy campaigners say the bill clearly lays out the mass surveillance powers that would be at the disposal of the security services, and want it amended so that the surveillance is targeted and based on suspicion and argue that the powers are so sweeping, and the bill's language so general, that not just the security services but also government bodies will be able to analyse the records of millions of people even if they are not under suspicion.\n\nTroy Wolverton notes that the documents leaked by Snowden revealed widespread abuses, both at home and abroad. He says that \"instead of targeted surveillance of particular threats, the NSA had a motto and mentality of 'collect it all' on everybody, the privacy of anyone involved be damned\".\n\nJo Glanville, editor of Index on Censorship and a member of the Ministry of Justice working party on libel reform, asserts that keeping the country safe does not entitle the government or the intelligence services to act without regards to our human rights and that \"it is possible to conduct targeted surveillance with effective oversight while according respect to all our rights\".\n\nComputer scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an algorithmic framework for conducting targeted surveillance of individuals within social networks while protecting the privacy of \"untargeted\" digital bystanders that \"outputs a list of confirmed targeted individuals discovered in the network, for whom any subsequent action (e.g., publication in a most-wanted list, further surveillance, or arrest in the case of terrorism; medical treatment or quarantine in the case of epidemics) will not compromise the privacy of the protected\".\n\nIn January 2017 it was reported that German federal agencies are using a new program called \"Radar\", developed by the BKA and the University of Zürich, that aims to help evaluate the risk posed by persons. It includes a catalog of questions such as about the person's relationship to violence and access to weapons and takes into account data on past terrorists.\n\nThe crypto and security communities can make the Internet more secure by making population-wide surveillance technically or economically infeasible, understanding that modest amounts of targeted surveillance will always be technically and economically feasible.\n\nEdward Snowden notes that \"we're thwarting mass surveillance when we use encryption. We're not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed\".\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation claims that the NSA and its defenders are trying to pass off their mass surveillance as being authorized under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act as \"targeted surveillance\" even though it includes the collection of the content of hundreds of millions of communications annually and the real-time search of billions more which according to them fits the definition \"mass surveillance\" under Section 702.\n\nFurthermore, the organization asks how the US government justified the Yahoo email scanning under FISA, asking whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has interpreted FISA – which authorizes targeted surveillance of certain foreigners' (such as spies or terrorists) communications – to mean that the government can conscript Yahoo into mass surveillance of all of its users' emails.\n\nAccording to documents obtained from Edward Snowden and published by Glenn Greenwald the NSA and GCHQ have been automating targeted operations, allowing for \"industrial scale exploitation\" that can potentially infect \"millions\" of machines with malware.\n\n\n"}

The term was defined in 1990 by Deborah Rhode who published a paper by this title in the 1991 Yale Law Journal.\n\nThe term, inspired by difficulties of people grappling with class and racial issues, was applied by Rhode specifically to the women's movement as being a problem of \"perception\", since \"the most traditional approach has been to acknowledge gender disparities, but to deny their injustice\". Twenty years later, the problem was revisited by Brenda Frink of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research with her article \"The persistence of the no-problem problem\". She quoted Rhode's 2010 book on the subject of women's physical appearance, \"The Beauty Bias: The Injustice of Appearance in Life and Law\". The idea of perception in the problem had been taken a step further and been distilled into an issue of physical appearance, since \"women who fall short of cultural beauty ideals are disadvantaged in jobs, salaries, and promotions even where looks bear no obvious relationship to performance\". \nIn 2014 Ilene Fischer wrote a blog in the Huffington Post titled \"The No-Problem Problem\" applying the term to the gender pay gap at Microsoft.\n"}
{"id": "192303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192303", "title": "The Library of Babel", "text": "The Library of Babel\n\n\"The Library of Babel\" () is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986), conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set.\n\nThe story was originally published in Spanish in Borges' 1941 collection of stories \"El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan\" (\"The Garden of Forking Paths\"). That entire book was, in turn, included within his much-reprinted \"Ficciones\" (1944). Two English-language translations appeared approximately simultaneously in 1962, one by James E. Irby in a diverse collection of Borges's works titled \"Labyrinths\" and the other by Anthony Kerrigan as part of a collaborative translation of the entirety of \"Ficciones\".\n\nBorges' narrator describes how his universe consists of an enormous expanse of adjacent hexagonal rooms, each of which contains the bare necessities for human survival—and four walls of bookshelves. Though the order and content of the books are random and apparently completely meaningless, the inhabitants believe that the books contain every possible ordering of just 25 basic characters (22 letters, the period, the comma, and space). Though the vast majority of the books in this universe are pure gibberish, the library also must contain, somewhere, every coherent book ever written, or that might ever be written, and every possible permutation or slightly erroneous version of every one of those books. The narrator notes that the library must contain all useful information, including predictions of the future, biographies of any person, and translations of every book in all languages. Conversely, for many of the texts, some language could be devised that would make it readable with any of a vast number of different contents.\n\nDespite—indeed, because of—this glut of information, all books are totally useless to the reader, leaving the librarians in a state of suicidal despair. This leads some librarians to superstitious and cult-like behaviors, such as the \"Purifiers\", who arbitrarily destroy books they deem nonsense as they scour through the library seeking the \"Crimson Hexagon\" and its illustrated, magical books. Others believe that since all books exist in the library, somewhere one of the books must be a perfect index of the library's contents; some even believe that a messianic figure known as the \"Man of the Book\" has read it, and they travel through the library seeking him.\n\nThe story repeats the theme of Borges' 1939 essay \"The Total Library\" (\"La Biblioteca total\"), which in turn acknowledges the earlier development of this theme by Kurd Lasswitz in his 1901 story \"The Universal Library\" (\"Die Universalbibliothek\"):\n\nCertain examples that Aristotle attributes to Democritus and Leucippus clearly prefigure it, but its belated inventor is Gustav Theodor Fechner, and its first exponent, Kurd Lasswitz. [...] In his book \"The Race with the Tortoise\" (Berlin, 1919), Dr Theodor Wolff suggests that it is a derivation from, or a parody of, Ramón Llull's thinking machine [...T]he elements of his game are the universal orthographic symbols, not the words of a language [...] Lasswitz arrives at twenty-five symbols (twenty-two letters, the space, the period, the comma), whose recombinations and repetitions encompass everything possible to express in all languages. The totality of such variations would form a Total Library of astronomical size. Lasswitz urges mankind to construct that inhuman library, which chance would organize and which would eliminate intelligence. (Wolff's \"The Race with the Tortoise\" expounds the execution and the dimensions of that impossible enterprise.)\n\nMany of Borges' signature motifs are featured in the story, including infinity, reality, cabalistic reasoning, and labyrinths. The concept of the library is often compared to Borel's dactylographic monkey theorem. There is no reference to monkeys or typewriters in \"The Library of Babel\", although Borges had mentioned that analogy in \"The Total Library\": \"[A] half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum.\" In this story, the closest equivalent is the line, \"A blasphemous sect suggested [...] that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books.\"\n\nBorges would examine a similar idea in his 1975 story, \"The Book of Sand\" in which there is an infinite book (or book with an indefinite number of pages) rather than an infinite library. Moreover, the story's \"Book of Sand\" is said to be written in an unknown alphabet and its content is not obviously random. In The Library of Babel, Borges interpolates Italian mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri's suggestion that any solid body could be conceptualized as the superimposition of an infinite number of planes.\n\nThe concept of the library is also overtly analogous to the view of the universe as a sphere having its center everywhere and its circumference nowhere. The mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal employed this metaphor, and in an earlier essay Borges noted that Pascal's manuscript called the sphere \"effroyable,\" or \"frightful\".\n\nIn any case, a library containing \"all\" possible books, arranged at random, might as well be a library containing \"zero\" books, as any true information would be buried in, and rendered indistinguishable from, all possible forms of false information; the experience of opening to any page of any of the library's books has been simulated by websites which create screenfuls of random letters.\n\nThe quote at the beginning of the story, \"By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters,\" is from Robert Burton's 1621 \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\".\n\nThere are numerous philosophical implications within the idea of the finite library which exhausts all possibilities. Every book in the library is \"intelligible\" if one decodes it correctly, simply because it can be decoded from any other book in the library using a third book as a one-time pad. This lends itself to the philosophical idea proposed by Immanuel Kant, that our mind helps to structure our experience of reality; thus the rules of reality (as we know it) are intrinsic to the mind. So if we identify these rules, we can better decode 'reality'. One might speculate that these rules are contained in the crimson hexagon room which is the key to decoding the others. The library becomes a temptation, even an obsession, because it contains these gems of enlightenment while also burying them in deception. On a psychological level, the infinite storehouse of information is a hindrance and a distraction, because it lures one away from writing one's own book (i.e. living one's life). Anything one might write would of course already exist. One can see any text as being pulled from the library by the act of the author defining the search letter by letter until they reach a text close enough to the one they intended to write. The text already existed theoretically, but had to be found by the act of the author's imagination. Another implication is an argument against certain proofs of the existence of God, as it is carried out by David Hume using the thought experiment of a similar library of books generated not by human mind, but by nature.\n\nIn mainstream theories of natural language syntax, every syntactically-valid utterance can be extended to produce a new, longer one, because of recursion. If this process can be continued indefinitely, then there is no upper bound on the length of a well-formed utterance and the number of unique well-formed strings of any language is countably infinite. However, the books in the Library of Babel are of bounded length (\"each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters\"), so the Library can only contain a finite number of distinct strings, and thus cannot contain all possible well-formed utterances. Borges' narrator notes this fact, but believes that the Library is nevertheless infinite; he speculates that it repeats itself periodically, given an eventual \"order\" to the \"disorder\" of the seemingly-random arrangement of books.\n\nIn a short essay, W. V. O. Quine noted the interesting fact that the Library of Babel is finite (that is, we will theoretically come to a point in history where everything has been written), and that the Library of Babel can be constructed in its entirety simply by writing a dot on one piece of paper and a dash on another. These two sheets of paper could then be alternated at random to produce every possible text, in Morse code or equivalently binary. Writes Quine, \"The ultimate absurdity is now staring us in the face: a universal library of two volumes, one containing a single dot and the other a dash. Persistent repetition and alternation of the two are sufficient, we well know, for spelling out any and every truth. The miracle of the finite but universal library is a mere inflation of the miracle of binary notation: everything worth saying, and everything else as well, can be said with two characters.\"\n\nThe full possible set of protein sequences (Protein sequence space) has been compared to the Library of Babel. In the \"Library of Babel\", finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has picked out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequence is surrounded by a set of neighbors (point mutants) that are likely to have at least some function. Daniel Dennett's 1995 book \"Darwin's Dangerous Idea\" includes an elaboration of the Library of Babel concept to imagine the set of all possible genetic sequences, which he calls the Library of Mendel, in order to illustrate the mathematics of genetic variation. Dennett uses this concept again later in the book to imagine all possible algorithms that can be included in his Toshiba computer, which he calls the Library of Toshiba. He describes the Library of Mendel and the Library of Toshiba as subsets within the Library of Babel.\n\n\n"}

It was first published in \"McClure's\" in July 1910.\n\nUnder the influence of Japan, China modernizes and undergoes its own version of the Meiji Reforms in the 1910s. In 1922, China breaks away from Japan and fights a brief war that culminates in the Chinese annexation of the Japanese possessions of Korea, Formosa, and Manchuria. Over the next half century, China's population steadily grows, and eventually migration overwhelms European colonies in Asia. The United States and the other Western powers launch a biological warfare campaign against China, resulting in the destruction of China's population, the few survivors of the plague being killed out of hand by European and American troops. China is then colonized by the Western powers. This opens the way to a joyous epoch of \"splendid mechanical, intellectual, and art output\". In the 1980s war clouds once more gather between Germany and France, and the story ends with the nations of the world solemnly pledging not to use the same techniques they had against China.\n\n\"The Unparalleled Invasion\" was included in \"The Strength of the Strong\", a collection of stories by London published by Macmillan in 1914, which also included \"The Dream of Debs\", a critique of capitalist society in the US, and \"The Strength of the Strong\", which used a primitive background as metaphor of social injustice among men. \n\n\"The Unparalleled Invasion\" has been controversial for its depiction of genocide and has been cited as evidence of London's racism. The genocide is described in considerable detail and nowhere is any objection made to it. The terms \"yellow life\" and \"yellow populace\" appear in the story. It ends with the \"sanitation of China\" and its re-settlement by Westerners.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31054", "title": "Theological virtues", "text": "Theological virtues\n\nTheological virtues are virtues associated in Christian theology and philosophy with salvation resulting from the grace of God. Virtues are traits or qualities which dispose one to conduct oneself in a morally good manner. Traditionally they have been named Faith, Hope, and Charity, and can trace their importance in Christian theology to Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13, who also pointed out that charity is the most important.\n\nThe medieval Catholic philosopher Thomas Aquinas explained that these virtues are called theological virtues \"because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures\".\n\nA person receives the theological virtues by their being \"infused\"—through Divine grace—into the person. The theological virtues are so named because their object is the divine being (theos).\n\nThe first mention in Christian literature of the three theological virtues is in St. Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians 1:3, \"...calling to mind your work of faith and labor of love and endurance in hope...\" He later refers to this triad of virtues again, \"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation.\" \nIn 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). \"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" First, because it informs the other two: \"It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\" Secondly, from a temporal perspective, love lasts, while \"Hope isn't hope if its object is seen\", and faith gives way to possession.\n\nAquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (\"prudentia\") and moral virtue (e.g. courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness). This is frequently termed \"the Unity of the Virtues.\"\n\nAquinas stated that theological virtues are so called \"because they have God for their object, both in so far as by them we are properly directed to Him, and because they are infused into our souls by God alone, as also, finally, because we come to know of them only by Divine revelation in the Sacred Scriptures\".\n\nIn his treatment of the virtues, Aquinas viewed the theological virtues as being the product of habitual grace. According to Aquinas, this grace, through the theological virtues, allows humanity to become agents in meritorious action that is beyond their own natural ability. In this way it is supernatural.\n\nAquinas says \"Faith has the character of a virtue, not because of the things it believes, for faith is of things that appear not, but because it adheres to the testimony of one in whom truth is infallibly found\". (De Veritate, xiv, 8)\n\nAquinas further connected the theological virtues with the cardinal virtues. He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological virtues, caused by habitual grace, to find their fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal virtues.\n\nThe moral virtues are acquired by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology holds that the theological virtues differ from the cardinal virtues in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. Like the cardinal virtues, an individual who exercises these virtues strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.\n\nFollowing St. Augustine, Aquinas also recognized a separate but related type of moral virtue which is also infused by God. The distinction lies both in their source and end. The moral virtue of temperance recognizes food as a good that sustains life, but guards against the sin of gluttony. The \"infused\" virtue of temperance disposes the individual to practice fasting and abstinence. The infused moral virtues are connected to the theological virtue of Charity.\n\nPope Benedict XVI wrote three encyclicals about the theological virtues: \"Deus caritas est\" (about love), \"Spe salvi\" (about hope), and \"Lumen fidei\" (about faith: this encyclical was written both by Pope Benedict XVI and by Pope Francis).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24841877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24841877", "title": "Women-only space", "text": "Women-only space\n\nA women-only space is an area where only women are allowed, thus providing a place where they do not have to interact with men. Historically and globally, many cultures had, and many still have, some form of female seclusion.\n\nWomen-only spaces are a form of sex segregation, and practices such as women-only public toilets, women-only passenger cars on public transport or women's parking spaces may be described using both terms. They are sometimes referred to as \"safe space\". The goal is to provide women an area to work, free of male judgment or harassment.\n\nThese spaces do not go without challenge. Men's rights activists have launched lawsuits to gain access to female-only spaces, as for example \"Stopps v Just Ladies Fitness (Metrotown) Ltd\", regarding a gym in Canada. The access of trans women, with or without legal recognition of their acquired gender, is also sometimes contentious, both from an ethical and from a legal perspective. In some cases questions have been raised about the value and legitimacy of particular spaces being reserved for women.\n\nMany cultures have had a tradition of separate living space for the women of a household (\"women's quarters\"); this becomes more elaborate the larger the house is, reaching its peak in royal palaces. The best known example is probably the harem, a Turkish word, but similar systems existed elsewhere, and still do, in some places.\n\nSome societies segregate most public facilities by sex, according to their interpretation of Islam and gender segregation; critics calls this gender apartheid after the former South African system of racial division. The best known examples are Saudi Arabia (Women's rights in Saudi Arabia#Sex segregation) and Iran (Sex segregation in Iran, Women's rights in Iran). More disputed regimes include Afghanistan (Taliban treatment of women) and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nIn English-speaking societies, the rise of first wave feminism, including the long struggles for the vote (suffrage) and for access to education and the professions, led to various initiatives to widen women's possibilities.\n\nSome of these allow men at certain times of the day, week, or year, for example as guests. Other establishments allow men and women into physically separate areas. Others exist only temporarily, renting space for a few hours or days. Some of these allow children, either only girls or both sexes.\n\nIn almost all countries, public toilets are segregated by sex.\n\nPublic nudity is in many cultures restricted to single-sex groups. So public baths may separate men and women by time or by space.\n\nSpecific examples include:\n\nIn many cultures, laundry was seen as \"women's work\", so the village wash-house (\"lavoir\") acted as a space for women to gather and talk together as they washed clothes.\n\nPlaces to change one's clothes, for example for leisure (at the gym, swimming pool, or beach), or for work (locker rooms at factories and hospitals), or while shopping (department store fitting rooms), are usually single-sex. Some have individual cubicles, while others provide only communal facilities, e.g. an open space with benches and lockers.\n\nSome menstrual taboos require a woman to stay at home, or avoid certain places such as temples, but other cultures assign a particular place to segregate herself from her community, for example the \"chhaupadi\" (menstrual huts) of Nepal today, or \"The Red Tent\", a fictionalised version of Old Testament-era customs. The anthropologist Wynne Maggi describes the communal \"bashali\" (large menstrual house) of women in the Kalasha Valley (northwestern Pakistan) as their 'most holy place', respected by men and serving as women's all-female organizing centre for establishing and maintaining gender solidarity and power. \n\nThe seclusion of girls at puberty (i.e. menarche) is another such custom.\n\nThe lactation room is a modern, mostly American phenomenon, designed for using electric breast pumps and refrigerating the expressed milk. In many countries, spaces for women to nurse their babies can be known as breastfeeding rooms or nursing areas. The period of postpartum confinement was traditionally a time for new mothers to learn to care for their infant from older and more experienced women.\n\n\n\nWhen formal education was banned by the Taliban, underground schools sprung up, such as the Golden Needle Sewing School for writers to secretly discuss their work.\n\n\nHistorically, some health care services for women (particularly around childbirth) were staffed by women. As women gained increased access to education in the late nineteenth century, hospitals hired female physicians for female patients; nurses by this point were almost exclusively female.\n\nDuring second-wave feminism, health activists set up feminist health centers, particularly in the United States. Some places are for women from one background, such as the Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center. Some holistic care centres are for mothers and their children, such as Nkosi's Haven in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other festivals, conferences, etc. that focus on women's achievements and women's issues, but allow anyone to attend, from the Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848 to today's Women of the World Festival.\n\n\nMany celebrations, especially around rites of passage, are marked by a girl or woman and her female relatives and friends. For example, many cultures have a party before the wedding for the bride, in Western culture known as a hen or bachelorette party.\n\nMany amateur and most professional sports are segregated by sex.\n\n\n"}
