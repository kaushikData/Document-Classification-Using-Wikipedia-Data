Abstract structures are studied not only in logic and mathematics but in the fields that apply them, as computer science, and in the studies that reflect on them, such as philosophy (especially the philosophy of mathematics). Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the Bourbaki group: see discussion there, at algebraic structure and also structure).\n\nAn abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects this is called an implementation or instantiation of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.\n\nAn abstract structure has a richer structure than a concept or an idea. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of democracy, but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess. \n\n\n"}

In the context of resistance theory, a \"Beerwolf\", \"in contrast to a mere tyrant, not only broke the law, but overturned the entire moral order upon which it is based. All the subjects of such a ruler ... had the right to resist and even to kill him and all his supporters\".\n\nThe significance of the term lies in the fact that, for most of his life, Luther held that no subject could actively resist his secular ruler, an issue of obvious significance in a time when many rulers in the German lands and their respective subjects held competing religious beliefs. The concept of \"Beerwolf\" marked Luther's final, and most extreme, position on resistance theory, as it relied on natural law (specifically, what would later come to be called Hobbes' right to self-preservation) instead of earlier and more limited rights to resistance that Luther had accepted as flowing from German constitutional law.\n\nThe concept of just rebellion that the term \"Beerwolf\" introduced was subsequently developed by fellow Protestants who faced a similar situation in France, the Huguenot Monarchomachs.\n"}
{"id": "21265224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21265224", "title": "Capstan equation", "text": "Capstan equation\n\nThe capstan equation or belt friction equation, also known as Eytelwein's formula, relates the hold-force to the load-force if a flexible line is wound around a cylinder (a bollard, a winch or a capstan).\nBecause of the interaction of frictional forces and tension, the tension on a line wrapped around a capstan may be different on either side of the capstan. A small \"holding\" force exerted on one side can carry a much larger \"loading\" force on the other side; this is the principle by which a capstan-type device operates.\n\nA holding capstan is a ratchet device that can turn only in one direction; once a load is pulled into place in that direction, it can be held with a much smaller force. A powered capstan, also called a winch, rotates so that the applied tension is multiplied by the friction between rope and capstan. On a tall ship a holding capstan and a powered capstan are used in tandem so that a small force can be used to raise a heavy sail and then the rope can be easily removed from the powered capstan and tied off.\n\nIn rock climbing with so-called top-roping, a lighter person can hold (belay) a heavier person due to this effect.\n\nThe formula is\nwhere formula_2 is the applied tension on the line, formula_3 is the resulting force exerted at the other side of the capstan, formula_4 is the coefficient of friction between the rope and capstan materials, and formula_5 is the total angle swept by all turns of the rope, measured in radians (i.e., with one full turn the angle formula_6).\n\nSeveral assumptions must be true for the formula to be valid:\n\nIt can be observed that the force gain increases exponentially with the coefficient of friction, the number of turns around the cylinder, and the angle of contact. Note that \"the radius of the cylinder has no influence on the force gain\".\n\nThe table below lists values of the factor formula_9 based on the number of turns and coefficient of friction \"μ\".\nFrom the table it is evident why one seldom sees a sheet (a rope to the loose side of a sail) wound more than three turns around a winch. The force gain would be extreme besides being counter-productive since there is risk of a riding turn, result being that the sheet will foul, form a knot and not run out when eased (by slacking grip on the tail (free end)).\n\nIt is both ancient and modern practice for anchor capstans and jib winches to be slightly flared out at the base, rather than cylindrical, to prevent the rope (anchor warp or sail sheet) from sliding down. The rope wound several times around the winch can slip upwards gradually, with little risk of a riding turn, provided it is tailed (loose end is pulled clear), by hand or a self-tailer.\n\nFor instance, the factor \"153,552,935\" (5 turns around a capstan with a coefficient of friction of 0.6) means, in theory, that a newborn baby would be capable of holding (not moving) the weight of two supercarriers (97,000 tons each, but for the baby it would be only a little more than 1 kg). The large number of turns around the capstan combined with such a high friction coefficient mean that very little additional force is necessary to hold such heavy weight in place. The cables necessary to support this weight, as well as the capstan's ability to withstand the crushing force of those cables, are separate considerations.\n\nThe first step is to relate the radial or normal force formula_10(Newtons/radian) at any point of the rope wrapped around a capstan to the tension formula_11(Newtons) in the rope as shown in the figure. The y axis component of the upward force of the capstan on the rope, formula_10, must equal the Y axis downward component of the tension in the rope, formula_13.\n\nformula_14\n\nIn the limit as formula_15 goes to zero (the small-angle approximation), formula_16 and formula_17 \n\nformula_18\n\nSo the frictional force over a wrap angle formula_19 is\n\nThe increase in rope tension formula_22 over a wrap angle formula_19 is the frictional force over that angle so\n\nIntegration of both sides yields\n\nand exponentiating both sides,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe belt friction equation for a v-belt is:\n\nwhere formula_31 is the angle (in radians) between the two flat sides of the pulley that the v-belt presses against. A flat belt has an effective angle of formula_32.\n\nThe material of a v-belt or multi-v serpentine belt tends to wedge into the mating groove in a pulley as the load increases, improving torque transmission.\n\nFor the same power transmission, a V-belt requires less tension than a flat belt, increasing bearing life.\n\nIf a rope is lying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then all three following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. No separation – normal reaction formula_33 is positive for all points of the rope curve:\n\nformula_34, where formula_35 is a normal curvature of the rope curve.\n\n2. Dragging coefficient of friction formula_36 and angle formula_31 are satisfying the following criteria for all points of the curve\n\nformula_38\n\n3. Limit values of the tangential forces:\n\nThe forces at both ends of the rope formula_39 and formula_40 are satisfying the following inequality\n\nformula_41\n\nwith formula_42,\n\nwhere formula_43is a geodesic curvature of the rope curve, formula_44 is a curvature of a rope curve, formula_45is a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction.\n\nIf formula_46 then formula_47.\n\nThis generalization has been obtained by Konyukhov A.,\n\n\n\n"}

According to one commentator, \"there is hardly a corner of the Catholic world where the resources of this international force have not left an impression.\" This has allowed the Knights and its high-ranking officers to \"become powerful and influential in ways unimaginable in 1882 ... and no other lay group can match the Knights' ability to leave its mark on the church.\"\n\nIn 2017, the order gave more than $185 million directly to charity and performed over 75.6 million man hours in volunteer service. According to Independent Sector, this service has a value of more than $1.7 billion. The total charitable contributions from the decade ending December 31, 2015 rose to $15 billion. On average in 2015, each Knight of Columbus contributed 38 hours of community service. Much of the financial effort went to initiatives of the Vatican and the US bishops.\n\nUnited in Charity, a general, unrestricted endowment fund, was introduced at the 2004 Supreme Council meeting to support and ensure the overall long-term charitable and philanthropic goals of the order. The fund is wholly managed, maintained, and operated by Knights of Columbus Charities, Inc., a 501(c)(8) charitable organization. Before United in Charity was formed, all requests for funds were met with the general funds of the order or in combination with specific appeals.\n\nIn 2017, local councils donated more than 105,000 winter coats for children. This was up from 80,500 coats in 2012. Also in 2017, Knights donated four million pounds of food, and $2 million towards feeding the hungry.\n\nMore than $1.2 million was donated to Habitat for Humanity in 2013, in addition to 1.4 million volunteer hours. The very first ever national blood drive was sponsored by the order in 1938. In 2013, council blood drives attracted more than 423,000 donors.\n\nDuring the mid-1890s, the United States was in the middle of a serious economic depression. The order was thriving, however, and at the 1897 convention Supreme Knight John J. Phelan spoke of the need to assist fellow knights who were in distress. The Supreme Council then adopted charitable funds within local councils \"for the purposes of retaining their worthy members in good standing who are in need and in distress [and] who are absent from home.\"\n\nDuring the early 20th century, local councils often functioned as social welfare agencies. Local councils, acting alone and sometimes joining forces, established unemployment bureaus to find jobs for men and women, members and non-members alike. They \"were also dedicated to education, to relief for the poor and sick, and to a variety of charitable causes.\n\nWhen Supreme Knight Martin Carmody assumed office in 1927, on the eve of the Great Depression in the United States, he urged knights to cherish the virtue of charity. \"The Holy Grail may be sought over land and sea in many climes without avail,\" Carmody said, \"and may be found in the cup of cold water extended to the thirsty at our doorstep.\"\n\nWhen President Herbert Hoover established the President's Organization for Unemployment Relief in 1931, Carmody wrote to Hoover pledging the services of the Order. Carmody had already encouraged the 2,600 councils to have \"strong and active employment committees.\" Some, such as the 20 councils in Saint Louis, joined together to establish full time employment agencies throughout the 1920s.\n\nThe Order also established a Bureau of Employment at their headquarters in New Haven to coordinate efforts among councils. Peter Collins, who ran the effort for returning servicemen after World War I, ran the new Bureau. By the end of July 1931, a total a 43,128 unemployed people had been placed into jobs, in addition to those placements made by local councils who were working under the auspices of other organizations. In less than two years, the Order would provide more than 100,000 jobs. In October of that year, Hoover appointed Carmody to the Organization.\n\nThe Knights have a tradition of supporting those with physical and developmental disabilities. More than $382 million has been given over the past three decades to groups and programs that support the intellectually and physically disabled, with $4.1 million donated in 2012 alone. Former Supreme Chaplain Charles P. Greco is largely responsible for the Knights' interest in this area.\n\nOne of the largest recipients of funds in this area is the Special Olympics. In 2012, there were more than 107,000 Knights who donated 315,000 hours of service at nearly 20,000 Special Olympics events. Individual councils donated $3.7 million to the Special Olympics in 2013. The order's support for the Special Olympics goes back to the very first games in 1968. In 2017, nearly $6 million was donated along with more than 350,000 volunteer hours from 76,000 knights to the Special Olympics and other programs for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nIn 2012, more than 5,000 wheelchairs were distributed in 10 countries in a partnership with the Global Wheelchair Mission. In 2017, local councils donated 7,649 wheelchairs.\n\nIn 2017, more than $4.2 million was raised for disaster relief. Giving to those in need of natural disasters dates back to the earliest days of the order. After a flood in Kansas in 1903, the order raised $5,000 to be distributed to parishes and local councils, and it collected over $100,000 after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In 1927, the order gave $50,000 for flood relief.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus also gave significant charitable contributions to the people of Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in January 2010. The order also donated 1,000 wheelchairs to the people of Haiti in partnership with the Global Wheelchair Mission. Recognizing that the need was still great in Haiti some seven months after the disaster, the Knights of Columbus partnered with Project Medishare in August 2010 for an initiative entitled, \"Healing Haiti's Children.\" The initiative, backed by a more than $2.5 million commitment from the Knights of Columbus provides free prosthetic limbs and a minimum of two years of rehab to every child who suffered an amputation from injuries sustained during the earthquake. , more than 800 children had already been aided by the program.\n\nAfter the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a local council in Newtown, Connecticut, established a program asking people to pray a minimum of three Hail Marys for the victims and their families. Over 100,000 people pledged to say 3.25 million prayers.\n\nMore than $500,000 was donated to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, and $202,000 to victims of the April 2012 tornadoes in Oklahoma. After West Fertilizer Company explosion in Texas, nearly a quarter of a million dollars were raised. In total, more than $3.3 million were donated by individual councils for disaster relief in 2012. In 2015, the order donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to vicitims of typhoons and other natural disasters. A donation drive was undertaken following 2018's Hurricane Florence.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the Knights gave more than $20 million to provide food, shelter, clothing, and medical care to persecuted Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East. The order has helped Christians return to their homes in the Nineveh Plains region of Iraq. For those unable to return to their homes, the orderd is building McGivney House, an apartment building in Erbil, Iraq with 140 units for Syriac and Chaldean Christian families. Special units in the building are designed for elderly residents who left without care during the conflict in Iraq with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. IN addition to giving residents a dignified place to live, the house has a chapel on site and is close to a new Catholic church.\n\nArchbishop Bashar Matti Warda said of the Knights' efforts:\n\nAt a Solidarity Dinner for the Washington-based group In Defense of Christians, Vice President Mike Pence singled out the order for their \"extraordinary work caring for the persecuted around the world.\" Between 2014 and 2017, the Knights of Columbus Christian Refugee Relief Fund gave over $17 million for humanitarian relief work in the area. That includes $2 million to rebuild the primarily Christian town of Karamles in Iraq. \n\nAt the end of 2017, the Knights and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops recognized a \"Week of Awareness\" for persecuted Christians. In 2018, a national awareness campaign was launched by the Knights to bring greater public awareness to the plight of Christians in the Middle East. In 2017, the Knights praised the decision of the US government to provide direct US aid to persecuted Christians in the Middle East who were suffering at the hands of the Islamic State. They also led the effort to get the United States Department of State to declare the atrocities a genocide.\n\nIn 1979, each Knight was assessed a 50 cent per capita tax to establish a $500,000 Luke E. Hart Memorial Fund for the \"purposes of promoting increased devotion to Our Blessed Mother and for the preservation of the\" Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in perpetuity.\n\nThe multimillion-dollar \"Pacem in Terris\" Fund aids the Catholic Church's efforts for peace in the Middle East. A further $20 million went to church facilities and $7.4 million to Catholic schools from state and local councils. The order has provided funding to restore Roman antiquities, and purchased and operates the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.\n\nThe \"Vicarius Christi\" Fund has an endowment of $20 million. Since its establishment in 1981, the fund has generated over $57 million for the Pope's personal charities. The funds are invested in loans to churches. \n\nThe Vox Clara Committee received $100,000 in support of its efforts to translate liturgical texts. In 1965, the Knights donated the land on which the Paul VI Audience Hall was built to Pope Paul VI.\n\nThe Knights give to individual churches and diocese, but is also a major donor to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. They have spent more than $1.4 million between 2010 and 2014 to provide workshops for the bishops coordinated by the National Catholic Bioethics Center. Since 1977, the order has provided funding to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nIn 2012, $1.8 million was given by state and local councils to seminaries, with an additional $5.9 million in direct assistance to seminarians. In 2017, more than $3.8 million was given to 6,348 seminarians and postulants. The order also has eleven separate funds totaling $18 million to assist men and women who are discerning religious vocations pay tuition and other expenses.\n\nIn the early years of the order, educational activities were limited to things like estalishing scholarships to local institutions, placing books in libraries, holding public lectures, and similar activities. In 1904, in the first national response to a call from the American church, the order presented a check for over $50,000 to The Catholic University of America to establish a chair of American history to counter the somewhat anti-Catholic bias of history-writing at the time. In the years following this initial gift, an additional $500,000 was raised to establish 50 scholarships at the university. Originally there was to be one fellowship for every $10,000, with preference going to Knights or their families.\n\nBy 1922, 146 K. of C. Fellowships had been awarded. In later years the funds permitted far fewer fellowships, which, in the words of the university's centennial history in 1990 \"have remained the most attractive fellowships under the control of the university despite drastic reductions in their number due to the effects of inflation upon university charges for tuition, board, and room.\"\n\nFollowing efforts to support servicemen during World War I, the order established an educational system for returning veterans. It included evening schools, scholarships, and a correspondence school, all of which were free for men who fought in the war. The system was run by Mark J. Sweany. Within four years, over 200,000 men would take courses in one of the order's schools, 400 would receive college scholarships, and over 10,000 would take correspondence courses.\n\nIn June 1919, the Knights established a school a school for servicemen at Camp Devens in Massachusetts. By November, when the government took over and the Knights left military facilities, classes were being taught on 25 army camps and naval bases with 5,884 students.\n\nThe brief experience showed both the need and the desire of servicemen to continue their education, however, and so the Knights became the first organization to establish free evening schools for able-bodied veterans. Courses were taught in academic, commercial, trade, and technical topics to prepare the ex-servicemen for post-war employment. The first such school opened in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 7, 1919. By the end of the year, 31,163 students were taking courses in 45 schools around the country. An insubstantial number of those students were not veterans, but instead paid tuition to attend.\n\nThe Supreme Council established a committee of education on August 7, 1919, to administer a series of night schools run by councils, and appropriated $50,000 for administrative costs. Occupational courses were offered to members and the general public for a fee. Courses were taught not only to improve the students' career prospects, but also to promote patriotism in the hopes that the greater good of the community would also benefit from the knowledge being imparted. Veterans were allowed to attend these schools at no cost.\n\nThe Knights of Columbus was the first organization to provide college scholarships to veterans returning home from World War I. The War Activities Committee first announced in August 1919 that 50 scholarships would be awarded, including tutition, fees, books, equipment, and room and board. Originally intending to limit the number of scholarships to 100, the Committee instead decided to award a scholarship to every man who was accepted to one of several designated schools by September 30, 1919. There were 2,291 applicants, and 1,002 were deemed eligible. Of those, 440 were deemed eligible for entrance by the colleges and universities, and 403 scholarships were awarded.\n\nA correspondence school was established by the Knights in February 1922 to serve veterans in areas outside of cities. By the end of that year, more than 10,000 students had enrolled from every state in the union. The goal was to extend to veterans \"in the smaller communities and in the rural districts of the advantages of free educational opportunities through correspondence courses.\" Students were permitted to take one course at a time.\n\nThe courses were established for the benefit of those men and women who had served in the militaries of the United States or her allies during World War I, but not civilians. The order partnered with several universities to prepare the courses, and several provided materials at low or no cost.\n\nStudents paid their own postage, and put down refundable deposits on some books, but there were no other costs for most courses. When equipment was needed, students could either furnish their own or purchase it at \"the lowest possible price\" from the Knights' Educational Bureau. Students could take up to one year to complete the courses.\n\nThe order funded a message from the Pope to the delegates of the 1979 National Catholic Education Association convention in which the pontiff stressed the importance of Catholic education. The same year, the Supreme Board voted to fund the Conference's Advisory Committee on Public Policy and Catholic Schools.\n\nIn 1979, the Supreme Board voted to fund the Conference's Advisory Committee on Public Policy and Catholic Schools. In 1980, each member in the United States and Canada was assessed $1.00 to raise $1 million for the newly established Father Michael J. McGivney Memorial Fund for New Iniatives in Catholic Education. The fund was designed to support the National Catholic Education Association's research efforts. The association expressed their appreciation for this and other efforts to promote Catholic education by awarding the order the C. ALbert Koob Merit Award in 1981.\n\nSince the 1960s, the Knights' Satellite Uplink Program has provided funding to broadcast a number of papal events, including the annual Easter and Christmas Masses, as well as the World Day of Peace in Assisi, World Youth Days, the opening of the Holy Door at St. Peter's Basilica for the Millennial Jubilee, Pope John Paul II's visit to Nazareth, and several other events. In missionary territories the order also pays for the satellite downlink.\n\nThe Satellite Uplink project was originally planned to telecast three papal events each year. However, the program expanded when, upon the death of Pope Paul VI, Bishop Andrew-Maria Deskur, president of the Pontifical Commission for Social Communications, telegramed Supreme Knight Dechant asking if the order would pay to broadcast the funeral and following conclave and investiture of the next pope. The same request was made shortly thereafter following the death of Pope John Paul I. It is estimated that each telecast was seen by more than 800 million people.\n\nIn recent years a contribution of $100,000 was made to support the Holy See's strategic communications office. It also purchased \"a mobile unit with recording and transmitting equipment to enable Vatican television to broadcast in high definition.\"\n\nIn 1977, Deskur asked the order for funding for two additional projects, the Vatican Film Library and Radio Veritas, both of which were approved. The film library was designed to collect all the known video footage of popes for use by journalists, scholars, and others. This resulted in the creation of the Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library at Saint Louis University.\n\nFollowing Pope John Paul II's trip to Mexico in 1978, the Knights produced an English-language video documenting the visit. The following year the pontiff returned to Poland. Bishop Paul Marcinkus, President of the Institute for the Works of Religion, later told the order that raw footage of the trip existed, but there were no funds available to edit it into a usable format. The Knights provided the money, and the videos were shown on Polish television and in movie theaters. During his visit to the United States in October of the same year, the order once again provided funding to video record it at the request of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThe order donated one of two new radio transmitters to the Vatican in 1966; the other was donated by Cardinal Francis Spellman. In 1977, Bishop Andrew-Maria Deskur, president of the Pontifical Commission for Social Communications, requested funding for Radio Veritas, a program to broadcast religious programming to the one-quarter of the world's population living behind the Bamboo Curtain in atheistic communist countries. \n\nThe Knights have continued to support the Vatican's news operation for decades.\n\nThe Knights are major sponsors of the Eternal Word Television Network, the Association for Catholic Information, the Catholic News Agency, and \"Crux\". According to John L. Allen Jr., \"Crux\" editor, while the Knights sponsor a major portion of their budget, the order has no control over content.\n\nAs part of their commitment to building a culture of life, the Knights consistently donate to pro-life causes, including millions annually to the recently established Ultrasound Initiative.\n\nThe Knights believe that, by paying for the machines in hospitals throughout the United States and Canada, women will be better able to visualize their unborn child, and less likely to go through with an abortion. The order also supports women in crisis pregnancies with alternatives to abortion, including adoption. , more than 950 ultrasound machines had been purchased, and they hoped to reach 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nEach year, the Knights bring veterans to Lourdes, France, as part of the International Military Pilgrimage to Our Lady’s Shrine. In 2017, the order brought over 200 veterans through their Warriors to Lourdes program. \n\nAs part of the order's efforts to support seminarians, they partner with the Archdiocese for the Military Services to educate priests who will serve as military chaplains. The Knights have given over $2 million to the effort since its inception.\n\nSince 2004, the Knights have produced \"Armed with the Faith,\" a \"virtually indestructible, waterproof, flip-top prayer [book], designed for use in the most rugged conditions, including hard battle.\" The books include prayers, information about the sacraments and holy days of obligation, and a primer on just war theory. It also includes reference material on the Church's teachings on the works of mercy and virtues. It closes with a number of classic hymns, a lost patron saints for the military, and the new Mass responses adopted in the United States in 2011. \n\nDuring World War II, Canadian Knights provided prayer books to soldiers.\n\nAfter the United States entered World War I, Supreme Knight James A. Flaherty proposed to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The organization already had experience, having provided similar services to troops encamped on the Mexican border during Pershing's expedition of 1916. Staff and chaplains were sent to every Army camp and cantonment. \n\nWith the slogan \"Everyone Welcome, Everything Free,\" the \"huts\" became recreation/service centers for doughboys regardless of race or religion. They were staffed by \"secretaries,\" commonly referred to as \"Caseys\" (for K of C) who were generally men above the age of military service. The centers provided basic amenities not readily available, such as stationery, hot baths, and religious services. One well-known \"Casey\" was major league baseball player Johnny Evers of \"\"Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance,\" who traveled to France as a member of the Knights of Columbus to organize baseball games for the troops. A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them. In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris. The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.\n\nTo pay for these huts and their staff, the order instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million. Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort. In 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights and other organizations undertook another effort to raise funds to support the welfare of the men fighting abroad. The amount apportioned to the order and the National Catholic War Council totaled $30 million which, when combined with earlier efforts, funded efforts to support troops both in the United States and overseas. After the war, the Knights became involved in education, occupational training, and employment programs for the returning troops.\n\nLess than two weeks after the outbreak of World War II, on September 13, 1939, Canadian Supreme Director Claude Brown wired each Canadian state deputy to inform them of his plans to establish a welfare program comparable to the \"huts\" sponsored by the order during World War I. The Canadian government accepted his proposal by the end of October, and formed a unified organization including the Knights, the YMCA, the Salvation Army, and the Canadian Legion. Between December 1939 and April 1940, the Canadian Knights raised almost $230,000, \"an extraordinary amount considering the fact that there were relatively few Knights in Canada.\" \n\nIn large cities, recreation centers were established, and morale programs were run in a number of training camps. Hostels were established for servicemen on furloughs first in Canada, then England, and eventually across Europe. Sporting events were organized, musical and comedy shows were produced, and even academic courses and a library were provided. \n\nRecognizing the danger the volunteers who staffed these camps were undertaking, the Canadian government gave them a stipend equal to that of a captain in the Canadian Army and made them eligible for retirement and disability pay. F. O'Neil, who ran the Knights' recreation center in Hong Kong, was captured by the Japanese and was made a prisoner of war. Six volunteers, including Brown, died during the war.\n\nCanadian Knights, and not the government, provided supplies for Catholic chaplains. Bishop Charles Leo Nelligan of the Military Ordinariate of Canada wrote that \n"}

Coherence is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) interference. It contains several distinct concepts, which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and has become a very important concept in quantum physics. More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.\n\nInterference is the addition, in the mathematical sense, of wave functions. A single wave can interfere with itself, but this is still an addition of two waves (see Young's slits experiment). Constructive or destructive interferences are limit cases, and two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.\n\nWhen interfering, two waves can add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one (constructive interference) or subtract from each other to create a wave of lesser amplitude than either one (destructive interference), depending on their relative phase. Two waves are said to be coherent if they have a constant relative phase. The amount of coherence can readily be measured by the interference visibility, which looks at the size of the interference fringes relative to the input waves (as the phase offset is varied); a precise mathematical definition of the degree of coherence is given by means of correlation functions.\n\nSpatial coherence describes the correlation (or predictable relationship) between waves at different points in space, either lateral or longitudinal. Temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time. Both are observed in the Michelson–Morley experiment and Young's interference experiment. Once the fringes are obtained in the Michelson interferometer, when one of the mirrors is moved away gradually, the time for the beam to travel increases and the fringes become dull and finally are showing temporal coherence. Similarly, if in a double-slit experiment, the space between the two slits is increased, the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear, showing spatial coherence. In both cases, the fringe amplitude slowly disappears, as the path difference increases past the coherence length.\n\nCoherence was originally conceived in connection with Thomas Young's double-slit experiment in optics but is now used in any field that involves waves, such as acoustics, electrical engineering, neuroscience, and quantum mechanics. Coherence describes the statistical similarity of a field (electromagnetic field, quantum wave packet etc.) at two points in space or time. The property of coherence is the basis for commercial applications such as holography, the Sagnac gyroscope, radio antenna arrays, optical coherence tomography and telescope interferometers (astronomical optical interferometers and radio telescopes).\n\nA precise definition is given at degree of coherence.\n\nThe coherence function between two signals formula_1 and formula_2 is defined as\n\nwhere formula_4 is the cross-spectral density of the signal and formula_5 and formula_6 are the power spectral density functions of formula_1 and formula_2, respectively. The cross-spectral density and the power spectral density are defined as the Fourier transforms of the cross-correlation and the autocorrelation signals, respectively. For instance, if the signals are functions of time, the cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity of the two signals as a function of the time lag relative to each other and the autocorrelation is a measure of the similarity of each signal with itself in different instants of time. In this case the coherence is a function of frequency. Analogously, if formula_1 and formula_2 are functions of space, the cross-correlation measures the similarity of two signals in different points in space and the autocorrelations the similarity of the signal relative to itself for a certain separation distance. In that case, coherence is a function of wavenumber (spatial frequency).\n\nThe coherence varies in the interval formula_11. If formula_12 it means that the signals are perfectly correlated or linearly related and if formula_13 they are totally uncorrelated. If a linear system is being measured, formula_1 being the input and formula_2 the output, the coherence function will be unitary all over the spectrum. However, if non-linearities are present in the system the coherence will vary in the limit given above.\n\nThe coherence of two waves expresses how well correlated the waves are as quantified by the cross-correlation function. The cross-correlation quantifies the ability to predict the phase of the second wave by knowing the phase of the first. As an example, consider two waves perfectly correlated for all times. At any time, phase difference will be constant. If, when combined, they exhibit perfect constructive interference, perfect destructive interference, or something in-between but with constant phase difference, then it follows that they are perfectly coherent. As will be discussed below, the second wave need not be a separate entity. It could be the first wave at a different time or position. In this case, the measure of correlation is the autocorrelation function (sometimes called self-coherence). Degree of correlation involves correlation functions.\n\nThese states are unified by the fact that their behavior is described by a wave equation or some generalization thereof.\n\nIn most of these systems, one can measure the wave directly. Consequently, its correlation with another wave can simply be calculated. However, in optics one cannot measure the electric field directly as it oscillates much faster than any detector's time resolution. Instead, we measure the intensity of the light. Most of the concepts involving coherence which will be introduced below were developed in the field of optics and then used in other fields. Therefore, many of the standard measurements of coherence are indirect measurements, even in fields where the wave can be measured directly.\n\nTemporal coherence is the measure of the average correlation between the value of a wave and itself delayed by τ, at any pair of times. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is. In other words, it characterizes how well a wave can interfere with itself at a different time. The delay over which the phase or amplitude wanders by a significant amount (and hence the correlation decreases by significant amount) is defined as the coherence time \"τ\". At a delay of τ=0 the degree of coherence is perfect, whereas it drops significantly as the delay passes \"τ=τ\". The coherence length \"L\" is defined as the distance the wave travels in time τ.\n\nOne should be careful not to confuse the coherence time with the time duration of the signal, nor the coherence length with the coherence area (see below).\n\nIt can be shown that the larger the range of frequencies Δf a wave contains, the faster the wave decorrelates (and hence the smaller τ is). Thus there is a tradeoff:\n\nFormally, this follows from the convolution theorem in mathematics, which relates the Fourier transform of the power spectrum (the intensity of each frequency) to its autocorrelation.\n\nWe consider four examples of temporal coherence. \n\nMonochromatic sources are usually lasers; such high monochromaticity implies long coherence lengths (up to hundreds of meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode helium–neon laser can easily produce light with coherence lengths of 300 m. Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, Δλ ≈ 2 nm - 70 nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50 nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600 nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.\n\nHolography requires light with a long coherence time. In contrast, optical coherence tomography, in its classical version, uses light with a short coherence time.\n\nIn optics, temporal coherence is measured in an interferometer such as the Michelson interferometer or Mach–Zehnder interferometer. In these devices, a wave is combined with a copy of itself that is delayed by time τ. A detector measures the time-averaged intensity of the light exiting the interferometer. The resulting interference visibility (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the temporal coherence at delay τ. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a fixed delay, here 2τ, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time \"t\" equal to τ. In this case, to find the temporal coherence at 2τ, one would manually time-average the intensity.\nIn some systems, such as water waves or optics, wave-like states can extend over one or two dimensions. Spatial coherence describes the ability for two points in space, \"x\" and \"x\", in the extent of a wave to interfere, when averaged over time. More precisely, the spatial coherence is the cross-correlation between two points in a wave for all times. If a wave has only 1 value of amplitude over an infinite length, it is perfectly spatially coherent. The range of separation between the two points over which there is significant interference defines the diameter of the coherence area, \"A\" (Coherence length, often a feature of a source, is usually an industrial term related to the coherence time of the source, not the coherence area in the medium.) A is the relevant type of coherence for the Young's double-slit interferometer. It is also used in optical imaging systems and particularly in various types of astronomy telescopes. Sometimes people also use \"spatial coherence\" to refer to the visibility when a wave-like state is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself.\n\nConsider a tungsten light-bulb filament. Different points in the filament emit light independently and have no fixed phase-relationship. In detail, at any point in time the profile of the emitted light is going to be distorted. The profile will change randomly over the coherence time formula_17. Since for a white-light source such as a light-bulb formula_17 is small, the filament is considered a spatially incoherent source. In contrast, a radio antenna array, has large spatial coherence because antennas at opposite ends of the array emit with a fixed phase-relationship. Light waves produced by a laser often have high temporal and spatial coherence (though the degree of coherence depends strongly on the exact properties of the laser). Spatial coherence of laser beams also manifests itself as speckle patterns and diffraction fringes seen at the edges of shadow.\n\nHolography requires temporally and spatially coherent light. Its inventor, Dennis Gabor, produced successful holograms more than ten years before lasers were invented. To produce coherent light he passed the monochromatic light from an emission line of a mercury-vapor lamp through a pinhole spatial filter.\n\nIn February 2011 it was reported that helium atoms, cooled to near absolute zero / Bose–Einstein condensate state, can be made to flow and behave as a coherent beam as occurs in a laser.\n\nWaves of different frequencies (in light these are different colours) can interfere to form a pulse if they have a fixed relative phase-relationship (see Fourier transform). Conversely, if waves of different frequencies are not coherent, then, when combined, they create a wave that is continuous in time (e.g. white light or white noise). The temporal duration of the pulse formula_19 is limited by the spectral bandwidth of the light formula_20 according to:\n\nwhich follows from the properties of the Fourier transform and results in Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle (for quantum particles it also results in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle).\n\nIf the phase depends linearly on the frequency (i.e. formula_22) then the pulse will have the minimum time duration for its bandwidth (a \"transform-limited\" pulse), otherwise it is chirped (see dispersion).\n\nMeasurement of the spectral coherence of light requires a nonlinear optical interferometer, such as an intensity optical correlator, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), or spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER).\nLight also has a polarization, which is the direction in which the electric field oscillates. Unpolarized light is composed of incoherent light waves with random polarization angles. The electric field of the unpolarized light wanders in every direction and changes in phase over the coherence time of the two light waves. An absorbing polarizer rotated to any angle will always transmit half the incident intensity when averaged over time.\n\nIf the electric field wanders by a smaller amount the light will be partially polarized so that at some angle, the polarizer will transmit more than half the intensity. If a wave is combined with an orthogonally polarized copy of itself delayed by less than the coherence time, partially polarized light is created.\n\nThe polarization of a light beam is represented by a vector in the Poincaré sphere. For polarized light the end of the vector lies on the surface of the sphere, whereas the vector has zero length for unpolarized light. The vector for partially polarized light lies within the sphere\n\nCoherent superpositions of \"optical wave fields\" include holography. Holographic objects are used frequently in daily life in bank notes and credit cards.\n\nFurther applications concern the coherent superposition of \"non-optical wave fields\". In quantum mechanics for example one considers a probability field, which is related to the wave function formula_23 (interpretation: density of the probability amplitude). Here the applications concern, among others, the future technologies of quantum computing and the already available technology of quantum cryptography. Additionally the problems of the following subchapter are treated.\n\nCoherence is used to check the quality of the transfer functions (FRFs) being measured. Low coherence can be caused by poor signal to noise ratio, and/or inadequate frequency resolution.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, all objects have wave-like properties (see de Broglie waves). For instance, in Young's double-slit experiment electrons can be used in the place of light waves. Each electron's wave-function goes through both slits, and hence has two separate split-beams that contribute to the intensity pattern on a screen. According to standard wave theory \n\nthese two contributions give rise to an intensity pattern of bright bands due to constructive interference, interlaced with dark bands due to destructive interference, on a downstream screen. This ability to interfere and diffract is related to coherence (classical or quantum) of the waves produced at both slits. The association of an electron with a wave is unique to quantum theory.\n\nWhen the incident beam is represented by a quantum pure state, the split beams downstream of the two slits are represented as a superposition of the pure states representing each split beam\n\n. The quantum description of imperfectly coherent paths is called a mixed state. A perfectly coherent state has a density matrix (also called the \"statistical operator\") that is a projection onto the pure coherent state and is equivalent to a wave function, while a mixed state is described by a classical probability distribution for the pure states that make up the mixture. \n\nMacroscopic scale quantum coherence leads to novel phenomena, the so-called macroscopic quantum phenomena. For instance, the laser, superconductivity and superfluidity are examples of highly coherent quantum systems whose effects are evident at the macroscopic scale. The macroscopic quantum coherence (Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order, ODLRO)\nfor superfluidity, and laser light, is related to first-order (1-body) coherence/ODLRO, while superconductivity is related to second-order coherence/ODLRO. (For fermions, such as electrons, only even orders of coherence/ODLRO are possible.) For bosons, a Bose–Einstein condensate is an example of a system exhibiting macroscopic quantum coherence through a multiple occupied single-particle state. \n\nThe classical electromagnetic field exhibits macroscopic quantum coherence. The most obvious example is the carrier signal for radio and TV. They satisfy Glauber's quantum description of coherence.\n\nRecently M.B. Plenio and co-workers constructed an operational formulation of quantum coherence as a resource theory. They introduced coherence monotones analogous to the entanglement monotones.. Quantum coherence has been shown to be equivalent to quantum entanglement in the sense that coherence can be faithfully described as entanglement, and conversely that each entanglement measure corresponds to a coherence measure.\n"}
{"id": "9908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9908", "title": "Equation of state", "text": "Equation of state\n\nIn physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy. Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.\nThe most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.\n\nAnother common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including neutron stars, dense matter (quark–gluon plasmas) and radiation fields. A related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology.\n\nEquations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.\n\nIn a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in process engineering problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids, and pipe sizing.\n\nMeasurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.\n\nBoyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:\n\nThe above relationship has also been attributed to Edme Mariotte and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.\n\nIn 1787 the French physicist Jacques Charles found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:\n\nDalton's Law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented for \"n\" species as:\n\nIn 1834, Émile Clapeyron combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the \"ideal gas law\". Initially, the law was formulated as \"pV\" = \"R\"(\"T\" + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where \"R\" is the gas constant. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0°C = 273.15K, giving:\n\nIn 1873, J. D. van der Waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the Redlich–Kwong equation of state and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong.\n\nFor a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form\n\nAn equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although SI units are preferred. Absolute temperature refers to use of the Kelvin (K) or Rankine (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.\n\nThe classical ideal gas law may be written\n\nIn the form shown above, the equation of state is thus\n\nIf the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\n\nwhere formula_19 is the density, formula_20 is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), formula_21 is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), formula_22 is the specific heat at constant volume, and formula_23 is the specific heat at constant pressure.\n\nCubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of V.\n\nThe Van der Waals equation of state may be written:\n\nwhere formula_25 is molar volume. The substance-specific constants formula_26 and formula_27 can be calculated from the critical properties formula_28 and formula_29 (noting that formula_29 is the molar volume at the critical point) as:\n\nAlso written as\n\nProposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation formula_26 is called the attraction parameter and formula_27 the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.\n\nThe van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, \"improved\" due to two independent reasons:\n\nWith the reduced state variables, i.e. V=V/V, P=P/P and T=T/T, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:\n\nThe benefit of this form is that for given T and P, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using Cardano's method for the reduced cubic form:\n\nFor P<1 and T<1, the system is in a state of vapor–liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.\n\nIntroduced in 1949, the Redlich-Kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor–liquid equilibria. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.\n\nThe Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):\n\nWhere ω is the acentric factor for the species.\n\nThis formulation for formula_54 is due to Graboski and Daubert. The original formulation from Soave is:\n\nfor hydrogen:\n\nWe can also write it in the polynomial form, with:\n\nthen we have:\nwhere formula_60 is the universal gas constant and Z=PV/(RT) is the compressibility factor.\n\nIn 1972 G. Soave replaced the 1/ term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the acentric factor (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.\n\nNote especially that this replacement changes the definition of \"a\" slightly, as the formula_61 is now to the second power.\n\nThe SRK EOS may be written as\n\nwhere\n\nwhere formula_54 and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.\n\nA downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982) proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation\n\nwhere formula_66 is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.\n\nIn the first version only formula_67 is translated,\n\nIn the second version both formula_67 and formula_70 are translated, or the translation of formula_67 is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter . This gives\n\nThe c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by\n\nThe c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation\n\nwhere the Rackett compressibility factor formula_75 can be estimated by\n\nA nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations. It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.\n\nIn polynomial form:\n\nwhere formula_81 is the acentric factor of the species, formula_60 is the universal gas constant and formula_83 is compressibility factor.\n\nThe Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The University of Alberta by Ding-Yu Peng and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:\n\nFor the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones. The departure functions of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.\n\nThe analytic values of its characteristic constants are:\n\nA modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor.\n\nThe modification is:\n\nwhere formula_88 is an adjustable pure component parameter. Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set formula_89 and simply use formula_90. For alcohols and water the value of formula_91 may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.\n\nA subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.\n\nThe modification is:\n\nwhere formula_88, formula_94, and formula_95 are adjustable pure component parameters.\n\nPRSV2 is particularly advantageous for VLE calculations. While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations. The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors. It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design. However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\n\nOne thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.\n\nThe Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990. The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.\n\nwhere:\n\nand\n\nwhere\nThe characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter formula_66 through\nwhere\n\nNoting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the Universal gas constant, and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of Avogadro's number and the molar mass, the reduced number density formula_103 can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as\n\nThe shape parameter formula_114 appearing in the Attraction term and the term formula_115 are given by\n\nwhere formula_118 is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by\n\nThe model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. \"et al.\" (1990).\n\nThe Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation with an association term from Wertheim theory. The development of the equation began in 1995 as a research project that was funded by Shell, and in 1996 an article was published which presented the CPA equation of state.\n\nwhere \"a\" is associated with the interaction between molecules and \"b\" takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.\n\nThe reduced coordinates are:\n\nAlthough usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from statistical mechanics. This equation is also called the Kamerlingh Onnes equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. \"A\" is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient \"B\" corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, \"C\" to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms. The coefficients \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", etc. are functions of temperature only.\n\nOne of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:\n\nNote that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.\n\nwhere\n\nValues of the various parameters for 15 substances can be found in \n\nStatistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) equations of state use statistical mechanical methods (in particular perturbation theory) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system. The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1989, but since then many different SAFT equations of state have been proposed. Often SAFT equations represent molecules as collections of spherical particles that interact with one another. One popular SAFT equation represents molecules as chains composed of spherical segments (PC-SAFT). In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.\n\nMultiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.\n\nOther thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.\n\nWhen considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions, sonic shock lithotripsy, and sonoluminescence, the stiffened equation of state is often used:\n\nwhere formula_136 is the internal energy per unit mass, formula_137 is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and formula_138 is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).\n\nThe equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by formula_139.\n\nThus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is \"already\" under about 20,000 atmospheres (2 GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100 kPa to 200 kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1 MPa to 2000.2 MPa).\n\nThis equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.\n\nAn ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state\n\nwhere formula_41 is the pressure, formula_142 is the mass density, and formula_143 is the speed of sound.\n\nThe equation of state for an ideal Bose gas is\n\nwhere α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, α = 3/2), \"z\" is exp(\"μ\"/\"kT\") where \"μ\" is the chemical potential, Li is the polylogarithm, ζ is the Riemann zeta function, and \"T\" is the critical temperature at which a Bose–Einstein condensate begins to form.\n\nThe equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.\n\nThe ratio formula_146 is defined by using formula_147 = density of the explosive (solid part) and formula_148 = density of the detonation products. The parameters formula_149, formula_150, formula_151, formula_152 and formula_153 are given by several references. In addition, the initial density (solid part) formula_154, speed of detonation formula_155, Chapman–Jouguet pressure formula_156 and the chemical energy of the explosive formula_157 are given in such references. These parameters are obtained by fitting the JWL-EOS to experimental results. Typical parameters for some explosives are listed in the table below.\nCommon abbreviations: formula_158\n\n\n\n"}

For example, a species may use a putative threat display, which in the ethogram is given a descriptive name such as \"head forward\" or \"chest-beating display\", and not \"head forward threat\" or \"chest-beating threat\". This degree of objectivity is required because what looks like \"courtship\" might have a completely different function, and in addition, the same motor patterns in different species can have very different functions (e.g. tail wagging in cats and dogs). Objectivity and clarity in the definitions of behaviours also improve inter-observer reliability. \n\nOften, ethograms are hierarchical in presentation. The defined behaviours are recorded under broader categories of behaviour which may allow functional inference such that \"head forward\" is recorded under \"Aggression\". In ethograms of social behaviour, the ethogram may also indicate the \"Giver\" and \"Receiver\" of activities.\n\nSometimes, the definition of a behaviour in an ethogram may have arbitrary components. For example, \"Stereotyped licking\" might be defined as \"licking the bars of the cage more than 5 times in 30 seconds\". The definition may be arguable, but if it is stated clearly, it fulfils the requirements of scientific repeatability and clarity of reporting and data recording.\n\nSome ethograms are given in pictorial form and not only catalogue the behaviours but indicate the frequency of their occurrence and the probability that one behaviour follows another. This probability can be indicated numerically or by the thickness of an arrow connecting the two behaviours. Sometimes the proportion of time that each behaviour occupies can be represented in a pie chart or bar chart\n\nEthograms are used extensively in the study of welfare science. Ethograms can be used to detect the occurrence or prevalence of abnormal behaviours (e.g. stereotypies, feather pecking, tail-biting), normal behaviours (e.g. comfort behaviours), departures from the ethogram of ancestral species and the behaviour of captive animals upon release into a natural environment.\n\nEthograms have also been applied to research concerning the behavioural response of animals to the presence of humans. For example, it has been used to analyze the reactions of black bears and baboons to humans.\n\nA sample ethogram of general behaviour: \n"}

The incident has since become legendary.\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming \"rōnin\") after their \"daimyō\" (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka, whose title was \"Kōzuke no suke\". After waiting and planning for a year, the \"rōnin\" avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. In turn, they were themselves obliged to commit \"seppuku\" for committing the crime of murder. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the Forty-seven Rōnin are known as \"Chūshingura.\" The story was popularized in numerous plays, including \"bunraku\" and \"kabuki\". Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the \"Genroku\" era, which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some , the first \"Chūshingura\" was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the \"Chūshingura\" survive.\n\nThe \"bakufu\"'s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century, when Japanologist Isaac Titsingh first recorded the story of the forty-seven \"rōnin\" as one of the significant events of the \"Genroku\" era. To this day, the story continues to be popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, Sengakuji Temple, where Asano Naganori and the \"rōnin\" are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\nThe event is known in Japan as the , sometimes also referred to as the \"Akō vendetta\". The participants in the revenge are called the or in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"Forty-seven Rōnin\" or \"Forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the .\n\nFor many years, the version of events retold by A. B. Mitford in \"Tales of Old Japan\" (1871) was considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the West. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the Forty-seven Rōnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned. Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\nMitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \"proofs\" authenticating the factual basis of his story. These documents were:\n\nIn 1701, two \"daimyōs\", Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori, the young \"daimyō\" of the Akō Domain (a small fiefdom in western Honshū), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the Tsuwano Domain, were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of the Emperor at Edo Castle, during their \"sankin-kōtai\" service to the \"shōgun\".\n\nThese \"daimyō\" names are not fictional, nor is there any question that something actually happened in . What is commonly called \"the Akō incident\" was an actual event.\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's shogunate. He became upset at them, allegedly either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly moral Confucian. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific \"bakufu\" duties, offence was taken.\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the \"Matsu no Ōrōka\", the main grand corridor that interconnects the \"Shiro-shoin\" (白書院) and the \"Ōhiroma\" of the \"Honmaru Goten\" (本丸御殿) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the \"shōgun\"s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a katana, was completely forbidden in Edo Castle. The \"daimyō\" of Akō had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by \"seppuku\". Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made \"rōnin\" (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with \"bakufu\" orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\nOf Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader Ōishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The \"rōnin\" saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\nŌishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as Ōishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A Satsuma man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai—by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour—that he abused and insulted Ōishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, Ōishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the \"rōnin\" took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\nŌishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly Ichiriki Chaya), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. Ōishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid Ōishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful \"rōnin\" now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to Ōishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\nAfter two years, when Ōishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard, and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn , early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, Ōishi and the other \"rōnin\" attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by Ōishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, Ōishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death. All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which Ōishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.\n\nŌishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there. He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the \"rōnin\" climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge (katakiuchi, 敵討ち). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, Ōishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but Ōishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the \"rōnin\" killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but Ōishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.\n\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The \"rōnin\" gathered, and Ōishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira—as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.\n\nAt that, Ōishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. Ōishi indicated he personally would act as a \"kaishakunin\" (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, Ōishi ordered the other \"rōnin\" to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.\n\nThey then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.\n\nOne of the \"rōnin\", the \"ashigaru\" Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Akō and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the \"rōnin\" turned themselves in.)\n\nAs day was now breaking, they quickly carried Kira's head from his residence to their lord's grave in Sengaku-ji temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.\n\nOn arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 \"rōnin\" (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different \"daimyō\".\n\nDuring this time, two friends of Kira came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the \"shōgun\" received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the \"rōnin\". As expected, the \"rōnin\" were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the \"shōgun\" finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit \"seppuku\" instead of having them executed as criminals. It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion. Ōishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed \"seppuku\".\n\nEach of the 46 \"rōnin\" killed himself in . This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six rōnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the \"shōgun\", while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh \"rōnin\", identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the \"shōgun\" (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by \"seppuku\" were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji, in front of the tomb of their master.\n\nThe clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any.\n\nThe tombs became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era. One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on Ōishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that Ōishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the \"rōnin\".\n\nThough the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven \"rōnin\" cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the \"rōnin\" had been sentenced to their honorable end.\n\nAsano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.\n\nBelow are the names of the 47 \"rōnin\" in the following form: family name - pseudonym (\"kemyō\") - real name (\"imina\"). Alternative readings are listed in italics.\nThe \"rōnin\" spent more than 14 months waiting for the \"right time\" for their revenge. It was Yamamoto Tsunetomo, author of the \"Hagakure\", who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven \"rōnin\" would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the \"rōnin\" to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The \"rōnin\" would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.\n\nŌishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.\n\nThe tragedy of the Forty-seven Rōnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the \"rōnin\" had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of \"kabuki\" and \"bunraku\" plays; the first, \"The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga\", appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in Osaka and Kyoto, farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as Manila, to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a \"bunraku\" puppet play called \"Kanadehon Chūshingura\" (now simply called \"Chūshingura\", or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a \"kabuki\" play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Takauji. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became Kō no Moronao and Ōishi became Ōboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the \"rōnin\" were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the \"rōnin\" dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\nThe story was turned into an opera, \"Chūshingura\", by Shigeaki Saegusa in 1997.\n\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan, the earliest starring Onoe Matsunosuke. The film's release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying \"benshi\" narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director Kenji Mizoguchi, who would later direct \"Ugetsu\", to make \"Genroku Chūshingura\". They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar \"rekishi geki\" (\"historical drama\") of \"The Loyal 47 Ronin\". Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source \"Mayama Chūshingura\", a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, \"\", is most familiar to Western audiences. In it, Toshirō Mifune appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series \"Daichūshingura\" as Ōishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic \"Swords of Vengeance\" (\"Akō-jō danzetsu\").\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as \"Daichūshingura\" and the more recent NHK Taiga drama \"Genroku Ryōran\", recount the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the \"Chūshingura,\" while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, \"gaiden\" dramatize events and characters not in the \"Chūshingura\". Kon Ichikawa directed another version in 1994. In 2004, Mitsumasa Saitō directed a 9-episode mini-series starring Ken Matsudaira, who also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the \"Chūshingura\" entitled \"Genroku Ryōran\". In Hirokazu Koreeda's 2006 film \"Hana yori mo nao\", the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin story were used as backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.\n\nMost recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie, titled \"47 Ronin\", released on December 25, 2013, and then again into a more stylized version titled \"Last Knights\", released April 3, 2015.\n\nThe Forty-seven Rōnin is one of the most popular themes in woodblock prints, or \"ukiyo-e\" and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are Utamaro, Toyokuni, Hokusai, Kunisada, Hiroshige, and Yoshitoshi. However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of Kuniyoshi, who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty triptychs.\n\n\n\n\n"}

People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented. Gain and loss are defined in the scenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g., lives lost or saved, disease patients treated and not treated, lives saved and lost during accidents, etc.).\n\nProspect theory shows that a loss is more significant than the equivalent gain, that a sure gain (certainty effect and pseudocertainty effect) is favored over a probabilistic gain, and that a probabilistic loss is preferred to a definite loss. One of the dangers of framing effects is that people are often provided with options within the context of only one of the two frames.\n\nThe concept helps to develop an understanding of frame analysis within social movements, and also in the formation of political opinion where spin plays a large role in political opinion polls that are framed to encourage a response beneficial to the organization that has commissioned the poll. It has been suggested that the use of the technique is discrediting political polls themselves. The effect is reduced, or even eliminated, if ample credible information is provided to people.\n\nAmos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman explored how different phrasing affected participants' responses to a choice in a hypothetical life and death situation in 1981.\n\nParticipants were asked to choose between two treatments for 600 people affected by a deadly disease.

This choice was then presented to participants either with positive framing, i.e. how many people would live, or with negative framing, i.e. how many people would die.\n\nTreatment A was chosen by 72% of participants when it was presented with positive framing (\"saves 200 lives\") dropping to 22% when the same choice was presented with negative framing (\"400 people will die\").\n\nThis effect has been shown in other contexts:\n\nIn logic, extensionality requires \"two formulas which have the same truth-value under any truth-assignments to be mutually substitutable \"salva veritate\" in a sentence that contains one of these formulas.\" Put simply, objects that have the same external properties are equal. This principle, applied to decision making, suggests that making a decision in a problem should not be affected by how the problem is described. For example, varied descriptions of the same decision problem should not give rise to different decisions, due to the extensionality principle. If judgments are made on the bases of irrelevant information as described, that is called an extensionality violation.\n\nTversky's and Kahneman's research has later been criticized for a subtle difference between the phrasings of the options in the two scenarios. Since the description of treatment A in the positive framing does not explicitly state that 400 people will die, nor does the description of treatment A in the negative framing state that 200 people will live, the probability of these consequences being 100% is only implied. This implication is, however, obvious only if one can familiarize themselves with both framings, as opposed to the respondents who participated in the experiment and saw only one of the framings, either the positive or the negative. In their case, it is possible to assume, with the positive framing, that by choosing the option A, the probability of more than 200 people being saved is greater than zero. Respectively, if introduced only to the negative framing, it is possible to assume that by choosing option A, the probability of more than 400 people dying is greater than zero. According to these assumptions, it would indeed be rational for the respondents to choose A over B when introduced to the positive framing, and B over A when introduced to the negative framing, since the two framings in case of treatment A are not truly mutually substitutable. In other words, the statement \"200 of 600 lives will be saved\" is not mutually substitutable with the statement \"400 of 600 people will die\".\n\nThe framing effect has consistently proven to be one of the strongest biases in decision making. In general, susceptibility to framing effects increases with age. Age difference factors are particularly important when considering health care and financial decisions. However, the framing effect seems to disappear when encountering it in a second language. One explanation of this disappearance is that a second language provides greater cognitive and emotional distance than one's native tongue. A foreign language is also processed less automatically than a native tongue. This leads to more deliberation, which can affect decision making, resulting in decisions that are more systematic.\n\nFraming effects in decision-making become stronger as children age. This is partially because qualitative reasoning increases with age. While preschoolers are more likely to make decisions based on quantitative properties, such as probability of an outcome, elementary schoolers and adolescents become progressively more likely to reason qualitatively, opting for a sure option in a gain frame and a risky option in a loss frame regardless of probabilities. The increase in qualitative thinking is related to an increase in \"gist based\" thinking that occurs over a lifetime.\n\nHowever, qualitative reasoning, and thus susceptibility to framing effects, is still not as strong in adolescents as in adults, and adolescents are more likely than adults to choose the risky option under both the gain and loss frames of a given scenario. One explanation for adolescent tendencies toward risky choices is that they lack real-world experience with negative consequences, and thus over-rely on conscious evaluation of risks and benefits, focusing on specific information and details or quantitative analysis. This reduces influence of framing effects and leads to greater consistency across frames of a given scenario. Children between the ages of 10 and 12 are more likely to take risks and show framing effects, while younger children only considered the quantitative differences between the two options presented.\n\nYounger adults are more likely than older adults to be enticed by risk-taking when presented with loss frame trials.\n\nIn multiple studies of undergraduate students, researchers have found that students are more likely to prefer options framed positively. For example, they are more likely to enjoy meat labeled 75% lean meat as opposed to 25% fat, or use condoms advertised as being 95% effective as opposed to having a 5% risk of failure.\n\nYoung adults are especially susceptible to framing effects when presented with an ill-defined problem in which there is no correct answer and individuals must arbitrarily determine what information they consider relevant. For example, undergraduate students are more willing to purchase an item such as a movie ticket after losing an amount equivalent to the item's cost than after losing the item itself.\n\nThe framing effect is greater in older adults than in younger adults or adolescents. This may be a result of enhanced negativity bias, though some sources claim that the negativity bias actually decreases with age. Another possible cause is that older adults have fewer cognitive resources available to them and are more likely to default to less cognitively demanding strategies when faced with a decision. They tend to rely on easily accessible information, or frames, regardless of whether that information is relevant to making the decision in question. Several studies have shown that younger adults will make less biased decisions than older adults because they base their choices on interpretations of patterns of events and can better employ decision making strategies that require cognitive resources like working-memory skills. Older adults, on the other hand, make choices based on immediate reactions to gains and losses.\n\nOlder adults' lack of cognitive resources, such as flexibility in decision making strategies, may cause older adults to be influenced by emotional frames more so than younger adults or adolescents. In addition, as individuals age, they make decisions more quickly than their younger counterparts. It is significant that, when prompted to do so, older adults will often make a less biased decision with reevaluation of their original choice.\n\nThe increase in framing effects among older adults has important implications, especially in medical contexts. Older adults are influenced heavily by the inclusion or exclusion of extraneous details, meaning they are likely to make serious medical decisions based on how doctors frame the two options rather than the qualitative differences between the options, causing older adults to inappropriately form their choices.\n\nWhen considering cancer treatments, framing can shift older adults' focus from short- to long-term survival under a negative and positive frame, respectively. When presented with treatment descriptions described in positive, negative, or neutral terms, older adults are significantly more likely to agree to a treatment when it is positively described than they are to agree to the same treatment when it is described neutrally or negatively. Additionally, framing often leads to inconsistency in choice: a change in description qualities after an initial choice is made can cause older adults to revoke their initial decision in favor of an alternative option. Older adults also remember positively framed statements more accurately than negatively framed statements. This has been demonstrated by evaluating older adults' recall of statements in pamphlets about health care issues.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "61891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61891", "title": "Genus (mathematics)", "text": "Genus (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, genus (plural genera) has a few different, but closely related, meanings. The most common concept, the genus of an (orientable) surface, is the number of \"holes\" it has. This is made more precise below.\n\nThe genus of a connected, orientable surface is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple curves without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the Euler characteristic \"χ\", via the relationship \"χ\" = 2 − 2\"g\" for closed surfaces, where \"g\" is the genus. For surfaces with \"b\" boundary components, the equation reads \"χ\" = 2 − 2\"g\" − \"b\". In layman's terms, it's the number of \"holes\" an object has (\"holes\" interpreted in the sense of doughnut holes; a hollow sphere would be considered as having zero holes in this sense). A doughnut, or torus, has 1 such hole. A sphere has 0. The green surface pictured above has 2 holes of the relevant sort.\n\nFor instance:\n\nAn explicit construction of surfaces of genus \"g\" is given in the article on the fundamental polygon.\nIn simpler terms, the value of an orientable surface's genus is equal to the number of \"holes\" it has.\n\nThe non-orientable genus, demigenus, or Euler genus of a connected, non-orientable closed surface is a positive integer representing the number of cross-caps attached to a sphere. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the Euler characteristic χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − \"k\", where \"k\" is the non-orientable genus.\n\nFor instance:\n\nThe genus of a knot \"K\" is defined as the minimal genus of all Seifert surfaces for \"K\". A Seifert surface of a knot is however a manifold with boundary, the boundary being the knot, i.e.\nhomeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.\n\nThe genus of a 3-dimensional handlebody is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded disks without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.\n\nFor instance:\n\nThe genus of a graph is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus \"n\"). Thus, a planar graph has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.\n\nThe non-orientable genus of a graph is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus \"n\"). (This number is also called the demigenus.)\n\nThe Euler genus is the minimal integer \"n\" such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with \"n\" cross-caps or on a sphere with \"n/2\" handles.\n\nIn topological graph theory there are several definitions of the genus of a group. Arthur T. White introduced the following concept. The genus of a group \"G\" is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) Cayley graph for \"G\".\n\nThe graph genus problem is NP-complete.\n\nThere are two related definitions of genus of any projective algebraic scheme \"X\": the arithmetic genus and the geometric genus. When \"X\" is an algebraic curve with field of definition the complex numbers, and if \"X\" has no singular points, then these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the Riemann surface of \"X\" (its manifold of complex points). For example, the definition of elliptic curve from algebraic geometry is \"connected non-singular projective curve of genus 1 with a given rational point on it\".\n\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem, an irreducible plane curve of degree \"d\" has geometric genus\n\nwhere \"s\" is the number of singularities when properly counted.\n\n"}

The death of the girl, Lisa Steinberg, sparked a lengthy and controversial trial and media frenzy. The legal case was one of the first to be televised \"gavel to gavel.\" Supporters characterized Nussbaum as a victim of horrific domestic abuse at the hands of her live-in partner, Joel Steinberg. Critics suggested she was a consensual partner in a sado-masochistic relationship and an unprosecuted co-conspirator in the young girl's death.\n\nBefore meeting Joel Steinberg in 1975, Nussbaum had been an editor and author of children's books at Random House publishers, and before that at Appleton Century Crofts. Steinberg was a defense attorney who sometimes handled adoption cases. Beginning in 1976, Nussbaum and Steinberg lived together in a brownstone apartment in New York City's Greenwich Village. Her 1977 book, \"Plants Do Amazing Things\", was dedicated, in part, \"to Joel, my everyday inspiration.\"\n\nDue to Nussbaum's occasionally obvious bruises and other injuries, friends and colleagues suspected that Nussbaum was the victim of domestic violence. Neighbors later stated to police they believed that Nussbaum and Steinberg were active participants in a \"some kind of a sexual sadomasochistic game.\" Friends occasionally offered to help if Nussbaum was being abused, but she declined their offers of intervention or aid and refused to implicate Steinberg. After extended absences from work, Random House put Nussbaum on consulting editor status in 1982.\n\nIn 1981, under dubious legal circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg took custody of an infant girl they named Lisa. The girl's birth mother had paid Steinberg a $500.00 legal fee to place the child with a Roman Catholic family; both Steinberg and Nussbaum were Jewish. Under similar circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg later took in a toddler they named Mitchell. Nussbaum and Steinberg never legally adopted either child.\n\nIn her 2005 book \"Surviving Intimate Terrorism\", Nussbaum argued that her denial of the danger she and her children lived in was typical of some chronically maltreated persons (see battered person syndrome). Nussbaum claimed that she fled from the home six times, only to later return. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also mentions the medical theory that trauma, especially prolonged trauma, can elicit the body's production of opioids that produce mental and physical numbness. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also suggests that her \"numbness\" further reduced her ability to think and act clearly, akin to \"Stockholm Syndrome\", a mental state wherein victims identify with their abusers.\n\nAccording to initial police reports, on November 1, 1987 around 7:00 p.m., Steinberg rendered Lisa unconscious with a severe blow to the head. Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes freebasing cocaine. According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had supernatural healing powers. At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned 911 at Nussbaum's urging.\n\nAfter Lisa's death, Mitchell was discovered in squalid conditions. The child's birth mother, Nicole Smiegel, had waived her parental rights. However, since a legal adoption had never occurred, Smiegel was ultimately granted custody of her son.\n\nWhen authorities learned of Lisa's death, they initially charged both Nussbaum and Steinberg with complicity. In the course of the investigation, however, charges were later dropped against Nussbaum. She agreed to testify against Steinberg, and medical examination revealed that Nussbaum was anemic, malnourished, and suffering from broken bones and chronic infections. With these findings, authorities determined that Nussbaum was physically incapable of seriously wounding Lisa.\n\nNussbaum's courtroom testimony against Steinberg earned substantial media attention, due in part to her face showing obvious evidence of physical trauma. There were also indications, as Nussbaum testified in court, that Lisa had been sexually abused by people outside of her immediate family. During the trial, medical experts testified that while Lisa's injuries were severe, she would have almost certainly survived if given prompt medical treatment.\n\nSteinberg was convicted on charges of first-degree manslaughter. After serving 16 years at the Southport Correctional Facility in Pine City, New York, where he was held in protective custody, Steinberg was released on parole in 2004 and got a job in construction.\n\nIn the years following Lisa's death, Nussbaum worked to rebuild her life and had numerous reconstructive plastic surgeries. She also co-facilitated a support group for battered women for about eight years and later worked as a paralegal for an organization that assists battered women. In 1995, Nussbaum began giving lectures about abuse at colleges and shelters. When Steinberg was released from prison, however, she receded from public attention until the publication of her book a year and a half later.\n\nThe Nussbaum case polarized feminist scholars and activists. Some saw Nussbaum as an archetypal victim of domestic violence whose actions were controlled and restricted not only by her abusive partner, but also by the culture at large that denies the seriousness of abuse in the home. Other leading feminists—notably Susan Brownmiller—suggested that while Nussbaum suffered violence from her partner, she also have shared full culpability for Lisa's death.\n\nBooks by Nussbaum include:\n"}

Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.\n\nThe HIIK's annual publication Conflict Barometer describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. Coup d'état, attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.\n\nFollowing a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.\n\nA political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, secession, decolonization, autonomy, system/ideology, national power, regional predominance, international power, resources, other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.\n(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.\n(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.\n(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.\nFor the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.\n\nThe table below presents data after the 2011 methodology revision. Violent conflicts include highly violent ones, the latter being classified into limited and full-scale wars.\n\n"}
{"id": "3084283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3084283", "title": "Humanitarian intervention", "text": "Humanitarian intervention\n\nHumanitarian Intervention has been defined as a state's use of \"military force (publicly stated that its use is for ending the violation of human rights) against another state.\" This definition may be too narrow as it precludes non-military forms of intervention such as humanitarian aid and international sanctions. On this broader understanding, \"Humanitarian intervention should be understood to encompass… non-forcible methods, namely intervention undertaken without military force to alleviate mass human suffering within sovereign borders.\"\nThere is not one standard or legal definition of humanitarian intervention; the field of analysis (such as law, ethics or politics) often influences the definition that is chosen. Differences in definition include variations in whether humanitarian intervention is limited to instances where there is an absence of consent from the host state; whether humanitarian intervention is limited to punishment actions; and whether humanitarian intervention is limited to cases where there has been explicit UN Security Council authorization for action. There is, however, a general consensus on some of its essential characteristics: \n\nThe customary international law concept of humanitarian intervention dates back to Hugo Grotius and the European politics in the 17th century. The subject of humanitarian intervention has remained a compelling foreign policy issue, especially since NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999, as it highlights the tension between the principle of state sovereignty – a defining pillar of the UN system and international law – and evolving international norms related to human rights and the use of force. Moreover, it has sparked normative and empirical debates over its legality, the ethics of using military force to respond to human rights violations, when it should occur, who should intervene, and whether it is effective.\n\nTo its proponents, it marks imperative action in the face of human rights abuses, over the rights of state sovereignty, while to its detractors it is often viewed as a pretext for military intervention often devoid of legal sanction, selectively deployed and achieving only ambiguous ends. Its frequent use following the end of the Cold War suggested to many that a new norm of military humanitarian intervention was emerging in international politics, although some now argue that the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the US \"war on terror\" have brought the era of humanitarian intervention to an end. James Pattison, however, argued in 2011 that the NATO intervention in Libya breaks this trend.\n\nGetting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in public international law since the 19th century.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Friedman and Paul James, explicit assertions about humanitarian motives are not a new phenomenon and military action is instead often rationalized through such moral rather than political arguments. As a pretext for deploying troops in Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea for an intended invasion of Ethiopia, Benito Mussolini thus claimed that he was attempting to both secure the Wal Wal border area where some Italian soldiers had been killed and abolish the local slave trade. Similarly, Adolf Hitler justified his own forces' occupation of the Sudetenland by suggesting that they were attempting to quash ethnic tensions in Czechoslovakia.\nPossibly the first historical example of a state expressly intervening in the internal affairs of another on the grounds of humanitarian concern was during the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century, when Britain, France and Russia decisively intervened in a naval engagement at Navarino in 1827 to secure for the Greeks independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nPopular opinion in England was sympathetic to the Greeks (philhellenism), in part due to the Greek origin of the West's classical heritage. The renowned poet Lord Byron even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries, while the London Philhellenic Committee was established to aid the Greek insurgents financially.\n\nIn 1823, after initial ambivalence, the Foreign Secretary George Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February that same year, he notified the Ottoman Empire that the United Kingdom would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. He was also instrumental in the outcome of the St. Petersburg Protocol 1826, in which Russia and Britain agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty. When this did not end the War, Canning negotiated a following treaty that ultimately led to the destruction of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet at the Battle of Navarino.\nThe treatment of minorities under the Ottoman aegis proved a rich source of liberal agitation throughout the nineteenth century. A multinational force under French leadership was sent to Lebanon to help restore peace after the 1860 Druze–Maronite conflict, in which thousands of Christian Maronites had been massacred by the Druze population. Following an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order. This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with Austria, Great Britain, France, Prussia and Russia.\n\nIn May 1876 Ottoman troops began massacring unarmed agitators for autonomy in Bulgaria, leading to the Eastern Crisis. The British launched a government investigation into the events, which confirmed that as part of an official policy, the Turks had killed at least 12,000 Bulgarians and obliterated about 60 villages. Lurid reports began to appear in newspapers, especially accounts by the investigative journalist William Thomas Stead in the Northern Echo, and protest meetings were called across the country.\nDespite the unprecedented demonstration of the strength of public opinion and the media, the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli remained an unmoved practitioner of \"realpolitik\", and considered British interests to lie in the preservation of Ottoman sovereignty in Eastern Europe. Lord Derby the Foreign Secretary disagreed and telegraphed the Sublime Porte that \"any renewal of the outrages would be more fatal to the Porte than the loss of a battle.\" Apart from issuing stern advice and proposals for internal Turkish reform and the legal protection of minorities, the Disraeli government did nothing. However, the issue convulsed British politics with former Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone coming out of retirement to campaign over the atrocities. In a famous campaigning speech he said:\nLet the Turks now carry away their abuses, in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Blmhashis and Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and their Pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall, I hope, clear out from the province that they have desolated and profaned. This thorough riddance, this most blessed deliverance, is the only reparation we can make to those heaps and heaps of dead, the violated purity alike of matron and of maiden and of child; to the civilization which has been affronted and shamed; to the laws of God, or, if you like, of Allah; to the moral sense of mankind at large.\n\nRising Great Power tensions in the early 20th century and the interwar period led to a breakdown in the concerted will of the international community to enforce considerations of a humanitarian nature. Attempts were made under the auspices of the League of Nations to arbitrate and settle international disputes. Aggressive actions, such as the Italian Invasion of Abyssinia and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria were condemned, but the League lacked the resolve to enforce its will effectively. The Allied discovery of the Holocaust and the subsequent Nuremberg trials at the end of World War II caused attitudes to change considerably. After the tragedies in Rwanda and the Balkans in the 1990s, the international community began to debate how to react to cases in which human rights are grossly and systematically violated. Especially, in his Millenium Report of 2000, then Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, called on Member States: \"If humanitarian interention is indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how hould we resond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica, to gross and systematic violation of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?\". Since the end of the Cold War, interventions have increasingly been used, such as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the 2011 military intervention in Libya. \n\nOne of the first champions of the duty of humanitarian intervention to prevent atrocities around the world, was the Victorian liberal John Stuart Mill, who wrote in his 1859 essay \"A Few Words on Non-Intervention\":\n\n\"There seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error...\"\n\nAccording to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in Algeria and India where the French and British armies had been involved. Mill's justification of intervention was overt imperialism. First, he argued that with \"barbarians\" there is no hope for \"reciprocity\", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilized interveners, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of Gaul, Spain, Numidia and Dacia. Barbarians,\n\n\"have no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man.\"\n\nWhile seeming wildly out of kilter with modern discourse, a similar approach can be found in theory on intervention in failed states. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between \"civilized peoples\".\n\n\"The disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country’s internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.\n\nMill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying \"government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist\". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.\n\n\"When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...\"Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern international law. International law after World War II establishes the principle of sovereign equality, and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. John Rawls, one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of \"well-ordered society.\" According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.\n\nMartha Nussbaum, however, is critical of Rawls' approach. She points out that the sufferings of individuals, not those of the impersonal states, form the moral foundations of humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the concept of \"well-ordered society,\" by falsely focusing on the state rather than individuals, cannot determine whether an intervention is justified. Instead, Nussbaum proposes a more concrete standard based on human capabilities (see Capability approach). She argues that \"[n]ational sovereignty should be respected, within the constraints of promoting human capabilities\". In other words, if a state fails to provide its citizens the basic \"capabilities,\" such as the capability to live a healthy life, then outside intervention is justified.\n\nSome critics contend that modern philosophical arguments for humanitarian aid fail to recognize the flaws of current international law itself. International Relations scholar Martha Finnemore argues that humanitarian crises often involve conflict between the most basic principles of international law: sovereignty, human rights and self-determination. As a result, philosophical attempts to integrate all those principles into a clear ethical guideline of humanitarian intervention is deemed to be futile. Legal scholar Eric Posner also points out that countries tend to hold different views of human rights and public good, so to establish a relatively simple set of rules that reflects shared ethics is not likely to succeed.\n\nHumanitarian intervention is a concept that can allow the use of force in a situation when the UN Security Council cannot pass a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations due to veto by a permanent member. Chapter VII allows the Security Council to take action in situations where there is a \"threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression\". However, any resolution to that effect must be supported by all five permanent members. The reference to the \"right\" of humanitarian intervention was, in the post Cold-War context for the first time invoked in 1990 by the UK delegation after Russia and China had failed to support a no-fly zone over Iraq. Therefore, in addition to humanitarian objectives the concept is designed to circumvent the UN Security Council by invoking a right. However, critics base their arguments on the 1648 treaty of Westphalia, which states the rights of sovereign nations to act freely within their own borders. This is upheld in the UN Charter of 1945, where in article 2(7) it is stated that \"nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.\" Thus, because both proponents and opponents of humanitarian intervention have their legal grounds on the charter of the United Nations, there is still an ongoing controversy as to whether sovereignty or humanitarian causes should prevail. The United Nations has also continuously been involved with issues related to humanitarian intervention, with the UN intervening in an increased number of conflicts within the borders of nations.\n\nAlthough most writers agree that humanitarian interventions should be undertaken multilaterally, ambiguity remains over which particular agents the UN, regional organizations, or a group of states should act in response to mass violations of human rights. The choice of actor has implications for overcoming collective action challenges through mobilization of political will and material resources. Questions of effectiveness, conduct and motives of the intervener, extent of internal and external support, and legal authorization have also been raised as possible criteria for evaluating the legitimacy of a potential intervener.\n\nThe most well-known standard for humanitarian intervention after World War II has been genocide. According to, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, the term was defined as acts “committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnic, racial, or religious group.” However, the norm has been challenged. Because there is a high possibility that if the international community applies the genocide standard to undertake humanitarian intervention, it would have been too late to make a meaningful intervention which should have prevented mass homicide in the concerned country.\n\nThese two well-known standards for humanitarian intervention do not resolve the states’ trade-offs between moral responsibilities and potential costs. Furthermore, intervention without a viable plan and workable strategy could threaten the states’ obligation to their own people. It should also be considered, that sometimes humanitarian intervention only results in open-ended chaos in the country without meaningful progress.\n\nThe understanding of what constitutes threats to international peace has been radically broadened since the 1990s to include such issues as mass displacement, and the UN Security Council has authorized use of force in situations that many states would have previously viewed as \"internal\" conflicts.\n\nIn several instances states or groups of states have intervened with force, and without advanced authorization from the UN Security Council, at least in part in response to alleged extreme violations of basic human rights. Fairly recent examples include the intervention after the Gulf War to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq as well as NATO's intervention in Kosovo.\n\nFour distinct attitudes or approaches to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention in the absence of Security Council authorizations can be identified:\n\nAlthough usually considered to be categorically distinct from most definitions of humanitarian intervention, the emergence of a 'Responsibility to protect' (R2P) deserves mention. Responsibility to Protect is the name of a report produced in 2001 by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) which was established by the Canadian government in response to Kofi Annan's question of when the international community must intervene for humanitarian purposes. The Canadian government's report, \"The Responsibility to Protect,\" found that the sovereignty not only gave a State the right to \"control\" its affairs, it also conferred on the State primary \"responsibility\" for protecting the people within its borders. Also, the report proposed that when a State fails to protect its people - either through lack of ability or a lack of willingness - the responsibility shifts to the broader international community. The report sought to establish a set of clear guidelines for determining when intervention is appropriate, what the appropriate channels for approving an intervention are and how the intervention itself should be carried out.\n\nResponsibility to protect seeks to establish a clearer code of conduct for humanitarian interventions and also advocates a greater reliance on non-military measures. The report also criticises and attempts to change the discourse and terminology surrounding the issue of humanitarian intervention. It argues that the notion of a 'right to intervene' is problematic and should be replaced with the 'responsibility to protect'. Under Responsibility to Protect doctrine, rather than having a right to intervene in the conduct of other states, states are said to have a responsibility to intervene and protect the citizens of another state where that other state has failed in its obligation to protect its own citizens.\n\nThis responsibility is said to involve three stages: to prevent, to react and to rebuild. Responsibility to Protect has gained strong support in some circles, such as in Canada, a handful of European and African nations, and among proponents of human security, but has been criticised by others, with some Asian nations being among the chief dissenters.\n\nSee:\n\nPotential examples of previous humanitarian interventions include:\n\nSome academics have referred to these cases as humanitarian interventions. However, in some cases this is only a retrospective classification of actions that were the result of a variety of motivations. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia for instance, was justified as self-defense rather than humanitarianism and has only later come to be seen as a possible example of humanitarian intervention.\n\nIn “Can Intervention Work?” Rory Stewart, a British diplomat and politician, and Gerald Knaus, a professor and author, argue that in certain circumstances limited, but resourced interventions for a humanitarian mission can succeed. The authors co-wrote an introduction at a moment when the international communality was debating whether and how to intervene in Libya, and highlight the West’s history of imperfect interventions. They quote Anthony Lake’s policy, “to help other nation’s build themselves” as a guiding principal in foreign intervention. The authors are critical of the RAND Corporation report \"Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building\" and argue every intervention situation is different based on the local political economy and there is not one universal approach that always works. The rest of the book is divided into two sections: first, Stewart reviews the international experience in Afghanistan since 9/11 based on his experience and travel in the country, and second, Knaus provides a case study on the international intervention in Bosnia. Overall, the authors warn against “over-interventions” such as Iraq that were based on “exaggerated fears\" and “irrational confidence” and often ignored “local tradition, identity, and history.” Stewart and Knaus advocate an intervention policy based on ““principled incrementalism” that invest time and resources in understanding local context and defining concrete goals.\n\nMany criticisms have been levied against humanitarian intervention. Inter-governmental bodies and commission reports composed by persons associated with governmental and international careers have rarely discussed the distorting selectivity of geopolitics behind humanitarian intervention nor potential hidden motivations of intervening parties. To find less veiled criticism one must usually turn to civil society perspectives, especially those shaped by independent scholars who benefit from academic freedom.\n\nSome argue that humanitarian intervention is a modern manifestation of the Western colonialism of the 19th century; the subjects of such intervention are ruled not by one sole party or entity, but by a mix of local institutions, NGOs and the interveners themselves. Anne Orford's work is a major contribution along these lines, demonstrating the extent to which the perils of the present for societies experiencing humanitarian catastrophes are directly attributable to the legacy of colonial rule. In the name of reconstruction, a capitalist set of constraints is imposed on a broken society that impairs its right of self-determination and prevents its leadership from adopting an approach to development that benefits the people of the country rather than makes foreign investors happy. The essence of her position is that \"legal narratives\" justifying humanitarian intervention have had the primary effect of sustaining \"an unjust and exploitative status quo\".\n\nOthers argue that dominant countries, especially the United States and its coalition partners, are using humanitarian pretexts to pursue otherwise unacceptable geopolitical goals and to evade the non-intervention norm and legal prohibitions on the use of international force. Noam Chomsky and Tariq Ali are at the forefront of this camp, viewing professions of humanitarian motivation with deep skepticism. They argue that the United States has continued to act with its own interests in mind, with the only change being that humanitarianism has become a legitimizing ideology for projection of U.S. hegemony in a post–Cold War world. Ali in particular argues that NATO intervention in Kosovo was conducted largely to boost NATO's credibility. Chomsky’s expression of “our excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence” is often used to describe Kennedy’s invasion of South Vietnam, which spread to all of Indochina. Furthermore, he asserts that the prospective leader of “humanitarian intervention” must uphold several qualifications. A first qualification is that the leader has to work as a moral agent that does not magnify the danger of elite culture, the efficacy of the intervention should be on the targeted population, and the people must be the moral agents that undertake humanitarian efforts.\n\nA third type of criticism centers on the event-based and inconsistent nature of most policies on humanitarian intervention. These critics argue that there is a tendency for the concept to be invoked in the heat of action, giving the appearance of propriety for Western television viewers, but that it neglects the conflicts that are forgotten by the media or occur based on chronic distresses rather than sudden crises. Henry Kissinger, for example, finds that Bill Clinton's practice of humanitarian intervention was wildly inconsistent. The US launched two military campaigns against Serbia while ignoring more widespread slaughter in Rwanda, justifying the Russian assault on Chechnya, and welcoming to the United States the second-ranking military official of a widely recognized severe human rights violator - the communist government of North Korea.\n\nFurther, sceptics have also argued that Humanitarian Intervention may have perverse consequences. Castan Pinos claims that “humanitarian” interventions generate a multiplicity of collateral effects, including civilian deaths, conflict-aggravation, violence spill-over into neighbouring regions and mutual distrust between great powers. \n\nJeremy Weinstein, a political scientist at Stanford University, has argued for \"autonomous recovery\": although the number of civilian deaths rises when violence between rebel groups is left unchecked, the eventual victors can develop institutions and set the terms of their rule in a self-enforcing manner. Such self-enforcement reduces the risk of a country slipping back into violence.\n\nAnother criticism argues that humanitarian intervention has historically consisted of primarily actions directed by so-called Northern states within the internal affairs of so-called Southern states, and has also led to criticism from many non-Western states. These critics argue that the norm of non-intervention and the primacy of sovereign equality is something still cherished by the vast majority of states, which see humanitarian intervention not as a growing awareness of human rights, but a regression to the selective adherence to sovereignty of the pre–UN Charter world. During the Havana G-77 summit in 2000, the \"so-called right of humanitarian intervention\" as it was described, was condemned as having no basis in international law. Furthermore, in his criticism, Chomsky writes that \"Humanitarian interventionism goes only one way - from the powerful to the weak\", and condemns what he called the targeting of the concept of national sovereignty by humanitarian interventionists, arguing that the primary purpose of national sovereignty is to give weak states partial protection against strong states, and that the protection of national sovereignty under international law stops internal conflicts in weak countries being exploited by strong ones.\n\n\n\nThis article relies heavily on the , which was accessed for translation on August 27, 2005.\n"}

Paul Hopper originally proposed emergent grammar as a functional approach to the study of syntax in 1987. Later work expanded to include approaches to phonology and other aspects of grammar.\n\nEmergent grammar postulates that rules of grammar emerge as language is used. This is contrary to the \"a priori grammar postulate\", the idea that grammar rules exist in the mind before the production of utterances. Contrary to the principles of generative grammar and the concept of Universal Grammar, interactional linguistics asserts that grammar emerges from interactions among language users. Whereas Universal Grammar claims that features of grammar are innate, emergent grammar and other interactional theories claim that the human language faculty has no innate grammar and that features of grammar are learned through experience and social interaction.\n\nInteractional linguistics has developed in linguistic discourse analysis and conversation analysis, and is used to investigate the relationship between grammatical structure and real-time interaction and language use.\n\nScholars in interactional linguistics draw from functional linguistics, conversation analysis, and linguistic anthropology in order to describe \"the way in which language figures in everyday interaction and cognition.\" Studies in interactional linguistics view linguistic forms, including syntactic and prosodic structures, as greatly affected by interactions among participants in speech, signing, or other language use. The field contrasts with dominant approaches to linguistics during the twentieth century, which tended to focus either on the form of language per se, or on theories of individual language user's linguistic competence.\n\n"}
{"id": "8884904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8884904", "title": "Islam and modernity", "text": "Islam and modernity\n\nIslam and modernity is a topic of discussion in contemporary sociology of religion. The history of Islam chronicles different interpretations and approaches. Modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent one. It has historically had different schools of thought moving in many directions.\n\nIn the 18th century Europe was undergoing major transformations as the new ideas of the Enlightenment, which stressed the importance of science, rationality, and human reason, and the new technologies of the Industrial Revolution swept across Europe, giving Europeans great power and influence. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the gap widened between the technical skills of some western and northern European countries and those of the rest of the world.\n\nThe rise of modern Europe coincided with what many scholars refer to as the decline of the Ottoman Empire, which by the 18th century was facing political, military, and economic breakdown. While prior to the 18th century the Ottomans had regarded themselves to be either of superior or, by the mid-18th century, of equal strength to Europe, by the end of the 18th century the power relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to shift in Europe's favor.\n\nIn 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte's army occupied the Ottoman province of Egypt and killed roughly 3000 Egyptians. Although the occupation was only three years, followed by lingering hostility to the French, the experience ultimately exposed the Egyptian people to Enlightenment ideas and Europe's new technology.\n\nThe exposure to European power and ideas would later inspire the new governor of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to draw on this technology to modernize Egypt, setting an example for the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government began to open embassies and send officials to study in Europe. This created conditions for the \"gradual formation of a group of reformers with a certain knowledge of the modern world and a conviction that the empire must belong to it or perish\".\nOne of the scholars sent by Muhammad Ali to Europe in 1826 was Rifa'a Rafi' al-Tahtawi. The five years he spent in Paris left a permanent mark on him. After his return to Egypt he wrote about his impressions of France and translated numerous European works into Arabic. Tahtawi was impressed with Europe's technological and scientific advancement and political philosophy. Having studied Islamic Law, he argued that \"it was necessary to adapt the Sharia to new circumstances\" and that there was not much difference between \"the principles of Islamic law and those principles of 'natural law' on which the codes of modern Europe were based\".\n\nLike Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din was also sent to Paris where he spent four years. After his return from Europe he wrote a book in which he argued that the only way to strengthen the Muslim States was by borrowing ideas and institutions from Europe, and that this did not contradict the spirit of the Sharia.\n\nIn the period between 1839 and 1876 the Ottoman government began instituting large-scale reforms as a way to modernize and strengthen the empire. Known as the Tanzimat, many of these reforms involved adopting successful European practices that were considered antithetical to conservative Muslims. In addition to military and administrative reforms, Ottoman rulers implemented reforms in the sphere of education, law, and the economy. This included new universities and changes in curricula, as well new economic systems and institutions. There were also European-inspired changes to law that restricted Islamic law to family affairs such as marriage and inheritance.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was the first Muslim country where modernity surfaced, with major shifts in scientific and legal thought. In 1834, Ishak Efendi published \"Mecmua-i Ulum-i Riyaziye\", a four volume text introducing many modern scientific concepts to the Muslim world. Kudsi Efendi also published \"Asrar al-Malakut\" in 1846 in an attempt to reconcile Copernican astronomy with Islam. The first modern Turkish chemistry text was published in 1848, and the first modern Biology text in 1865.\n\nEventually, the Turks adopted the metric system in 1869. These shifts in scientific thought coincided with Tanzimat, a reform policy undertaken by the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire that was inspired by French civil law. This reform confined sharia to family law. The key figure in the Turkish modernist movement was Namik Kemal, the editor of a journal called \"Freedom\". His goal was to promote freedom of the press, the separation of powers, equality before the law, scientific freedom, and a reconciliation between parliamentary democracy and the Qur'an.\n\nThe influence of modernism in the Muslim world resulted in a cultural revival. Dramatic plays became more common, as did newspapers. Notable European works were analyzed and translated.\n\nLegal reform was attempted in Egypt, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran, and in some cases these reforms were adopted. Efforts were made to restrict the power of government. Polygamy was ended in India. Azerbaijan granted suffrage to women in 1918 (before several European countries).\n\nAt the recommendations of reform-minded Islamic scholars, western sciences were taught in new schools. Much of this had to do with the intellectual appeal of social Darwinism, since it led to the conclusion that an old-fashioned Muslim society could not compete in the modern world.\n\nIn 19th century Iran, Mirza Malkom Khan arrived after being educated in Paris. He created a newspaper called \"Qanun\", where he advocated the separation of powers, secular law, and a bill of rights. Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, who was politically active in the Islamic world and published the pamphlet \"Al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà\" during a brief spell in France, proclaiming that Europe had become successful due to its laws and its science. He became critical of other Muslim scholars for stifling scientific thought, and hoped to encourage scientific inquiry in the Muslim world.\n\nModernism impacted interpretations of Islam. One movement was Islamic Modernism, which was both an attempt to provide an Islamic response to the challenges presented by European colonial expansion, and an effort to reinvigorate and reform Islam from within as a way to counter the perceived weakness and decline of Muslim societies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It called for \"a 'reformation' or reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islam\", and emerged in the Muslim world from Egypt to Southeast Asia.\n\nIslamic modernists argued that Islam and modernity were compatible and \"asserted the need to reinterpret and reapply the principles and ideals of Islam to formulate new responses to the political, scientific, and cultural challenges of the West and of modern life\". The reforms they proposed challenged the status quo maintained by the conservative Muslims scholars (ulama), who saw the established law as the ideal order that had to be followed and upheld the doctrine of taqlid (imitation / blind following). Islamic modernists saw the resistance to change on the part of the conservative ulama as a major cause for the problems the Muslim community was facing as well as its inability to counter western hegemony.\n\nJamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–1897) is regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic modernism. He believed that Islam was compatible with science and reason and that in order to counter European power the Muslim world had to embrace progress.\n\nMuhammad Abduh (1849–1905) was a disciple and collaborator of al-Afghani. He was even more influential than his master and is often referred to as the founder of Islamic modernism. Abduh was born and raised in Egypt and was a scholar of Islam (alim). He taught at al-Azhar and other institutions and in 1899 became Mufti of Egypt. Abduh believed that the Islamic world was suffering from an inner decay and was in need of a revival. Asserting that \"Islam could be the moral basis of a modern and progressive society\", he was critical of both secularists and the conservative ulama. He called for a legal reform and the reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islamic law according to modern conditions. While critical of the West, he believed that it was necessary to borrow or assimilate what was good from it. Abduh became a leading judge in Egypt after political activities in Paris as al-Afghani's assistant. He pushed for secular law, religious reform, and education for girls. He hoped that Egypt would ultimately become a free republic, much like how France had transformed from an absolute monarchy.\n\nMuhammad Rashid Rida (1869–1935) also became active in the Egyptian modernization movement as Abduh's disciple, although he was born and educated in Syria. \"Al-Manar\" was his journal, through which he initially advocated greater openness to science and foreign influence. He also stated that sharia was relatively silent about agriculture, industry, and trade, and that these areas of knowledge needed renewal. He would eventually evolve to conservative positions close to Wahhabism. Qasim Amin was another reformer in Egypt and Abduh's disciple who was heavily concerned with the rights of women.\n\nKhayr al-Din al-Tunisi was similarly educated in Paris around the same time. He surveyed the political systems of 21 European countries in an effort to reform Tunisia.\n\nNotable Modernists on the Indian subcontinent include Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–1898) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938) in the Indian subcontinent (the latter was also the conceiver of the modern state of Pakistan). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they rejected the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions.\n\nOther Modernists include Mahmud Tarzi of Afghanistan, Chiragh Ali of India, Ahmad Dahlan of Java, and Wang Jingzhai of China.\n\nAlthough Islamic modernists were subject to the criticism that the reforms they promoted amounted to westernizing Islam, their legacy was significant and their thought influenced future generations of reformers.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was also a prominent Muslim modernist of the twentieth century.\n\nIn some parts of the world, the project of Islamic modernity continued from the same trajectory before World War I. This was especially the case in the new Republic of Turkey, under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. But in Egypt, Hassan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood, the first Islamist organization, which had no interest in reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with modernity.\n\nTurkey has continued to be at the forefront of modernising Islam. In 2008 its Department of Religious Affairs launched a review of all the hadiths, the sayings of Mohammed upon which most of Islamic law is based. The School of Theology at Ankara University undertook this forensic examination with the intent of removing centuries of often conservative cultural baggage and rediscovering the spirit of reason in the original message of Islam. One expert at London's Chatham House compared these revisions to the Christian Protestant Reformation. Turkey has also trained hundreds of women as theologians, and sent them senior imams known as \"vaizes\" all over the country, away from the relatively liberal capital and coastal cities, to explain these re-interpretations at town hall meetings.\n\nThe aftermath of World War I resulted in the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the domination of the Middle East by European powers such as Britain and France. Intellectual historians such as Peter Watson suggest that World War I marks the end of the main Islamic modernist movements, and that this is the point where many Muslims \"lost faith with the culture of science and materialism\", but that several parallel intellectual streams emerged thereafter.\n\nArab socialism of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and Nasserite movement emerged as a stream of thought during decolonialization of Arab countries. It emphasized ethnicity, culture, politics and played down the role of religion. Its popularity peaked in the 50s and 60s.\n\nAs a political ideology based on an amalgamation of Pan-Arabism and socialism, Arab socialism is distinct from the much broader tradition of socialist thought in the Arab world which predates Arab socialism by as much as 50 years. Michel Aflaq, the principal founder of ba'athism and the Ba'ath Party, coined the term in order to distinguish his version of socialist ideology from the Marxist socialism in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, and social democracy in Western Europe.\n\nThe Six-Day War between Israel and its neighbours ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side. Many in the Islamic world saw this as the failure of socialism. It was at this point that \"fundamental and militant Islam began to fill the political vacuum created\".\n\nIn the late 20th century an Islamic Revival or Islamic Awakening developed in the Muslim World. (Islamic fundamentalism is the common term in the West used to refer to contemporary Islamic revivalism, according to John Esposito.)\n\nIt was manifested in greater religious piety and in a growing adoption of Islamic culture. One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the \"Hajj\", the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979. But the said increase in the number of pilgrims may also be attributed to other factors such as increase in populations, modern transportation facilities and to some extent the over all financial prosperity of the Muslims all over the world thus making the Pilgrimage affordable to more and more Muslim populations.\n\nTwo of the most important events that fueled or inspired the resurgence were the Arab oil embargo and subsequent quadrupling of the price of oil in the mid-1970s, and the 1979 Iranian Revolution that established an Islamic republic in Iran under Ayatollah Khomeini. The first created a flow of many billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia to fund Islamic books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques around the world; the second undermined the assumption that Westernization strengthened Muslim countries and was the irreversible trend of the future.\n\nThe revival is a reversal of the Westernisation approach common in Arab and Asian governments earlier in the 20th century. It is often associated with the political Islamic movement, Islamism, and other forms of re-Islamisation. While the revival has also been accompanied by some religious extremism and attacks on civilians and military targets by the extremists, this represents only a small part of the revival.\n\nThe revival has also seen a proliferation of Islamic extremist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere in the Muslim World, who have voiced their anger at perceived exploitation as well as materialism, Westernization, democracy and modernity, which are most commonly associated with accepting Western secular beliefs and values. The spread of secularism has caused great concerns among many Islamic political groups. It has been the reasoning for the Islamization of politics and protest, due to the large Muslim majority in the Middle East as well as the region's imperial past. For Islamic countries in the Middle East, there is not necessarily a problem as such with modernity, however, \"the problem is when modernity comes wrapped with westernization, with absolutely and utterly rampant materialism\".\n\nIn the book, \"Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World\" (1994), the author N. Ayubi explained what he believes to be the two main concerns of Islamic political movements and extremist groups in the Middle East; 1) the Western belief in a bureaucratic state and 2) the secular values and beliefs associated with concepts such as modernity.\n\nAccording to John Esposito:\n\nThe tendency to judge the actions of Muslims in splendid isolation, to generalize from the actions of the few to the many, to disregard similar excesses committed in the name of other religions and ideologies ... is not new.\n\nThe number of militant Islamic movements calling for \"an Islamic state and the end of Western influence\" is relatively small. According to polls taken in 2008 and 2010 by Pew and Gallop, pluralities of the population in Muslim-majority countries are undecided as to what extent religion (and certain interpretations of) should influence public life, politics, and the legal system.\n\n\n\n\nReform movements within Islam:\n\nNation specific:\n\nOther religions:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3570314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3570314", "title": "Lange model", "text": "Lange model\n\nThe Lange model (or Lange–Lerner theorem) is a neoclassical economic model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the means of production and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving economic equilibrium and Pareto efficiency. In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical market economy under perfect competition. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to marginal cost in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost.\n\nThis model was first proposed by Oskar R. Lange in 1936 during the socialist calculation debate, and was expanded by economists like H. D. Dickinson, Abba P. Lerner and Fred M. Taylor. Although Lange and Lerner called it \"market socialism\", the Lange model is a form of planned economy where a central planning board allocates investment and capital goods, while markets allocate labor and consumer goods. The planning board simulates a market in capital goods by a trial-and-error process first elaborated by Vilfredo Pareto and Léon Walras.\n\nThe Lange model has never been implemented anywhere, not even in Oskar Lange's home country, Poland, where Soviet-type economic planning was imposed after World War II, precluding experimentation with Lange-style economy. Some parallels might be drawn with the New Economic Mechanism or so-called Goulash Communism in Hungary under Kádár, although this was not a pure Lange-model system.\n\nThe model is sometimes called the \"Lange–Lerner\" model. Abba Lerner wrote a series of articles that greatly influenced Lange's thinking. For example, Lerner (1938) caused Lange to re-write his 1936 and 1937 articles on market socialism, before they were re-published as chapters in a 1938 book. Lerner (1938) influenced Lange's thinking on social dividend payments. Lerner (1944) also argued that investment in the Lange model would inevitably be politicized.\n\nThe Lange model was developed in response to Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek's criticisms of socialism during the socialist calculation debate. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists Vilfredo Pareto and Léon Walras. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient if there is no way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important theoretical force behind the development of the concept of market socialism.\n\nThe Lange model suggests three levels of decision-making. The lowest level contains firms and households, the intermediate level contains industrial ministries, and the highest level is the central planning board. The board sets the initial price of consumer goods arbitrarily and informs the producing firms of these prices. The state-owned firms then produce at the level of output where marginal cost equals price, P = MC, so as to minimize the cost of production. At the intermediate level, industrial ministries determine the sectoral expansion of industry. Households decide how to allocate income and how much labor to supply by choosing between work and leisure.\n\nThe key institutions of the Lange model include the central planning board (CPB), industrial ministries for each economic sector, and state enterprises managed democratically by their employees.\n\nBecause prices are set by the central planning board \"artificially\" aiming to achieve planned growth objectives, it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in equilibrium at first. To produce the correct amount of goods and services, the Lange model suggests a trial-and-error method. If there is a surplus of a particular good, the central planning board lowers the price of that good. Conversely, if there is a shortage of a good, the board raises the price. This process of price adjustments takes place until equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved.\n\nThe central planning board (CPB) has three major functions in the Lange model: First it instructs firms to set price to equal marginal cost, secondly it adjusts prices to attain market-clearing prices for goods and services, and finally, it reinvests the economic profit derived from state enterprises into the economy based on a target rate of growth. The central planning board also distributes social dividends to the population.\n\nApart from setting prices, the central planning board allocates social dividends. Because all non-labor factors of production are publicly owned, the rents and profits of these resources belong to the public. The profits would be used to finance a social dividend scheme based on the individuals' share in the income derived from the socially owned capital and natural resources, providing a complimentary source of income for workers alongside their salaries and wages.\n\nThe Lange economic model has a number of theoretical advantages. One advantage is public control over investment. The rate of economic growth would be largely state-determined and a major determinant would be investment ratio.\n\nAnother advantage argued by Lange was that externalities could be better accounted for, thanks to the state's ability to manipulate resource prices. Because the state controls all firms, they could easily factor the cost of an externality into the price of a certain resource. Because decisions are made at higher rather than lower levels, it is argued that these decisions are less likely to have undesirable environmental consequences.\n\nFurthermore, because the state uses marginal cost pricing and determines entry, Langean socialism can avoid monopolies and the accompanying lack of allocative efficiency and x-efficiency.\n\nThe model claims to solve another main criticism of capitalism. Lange believed that his model would reduce cyclical instability because the state would control savings and investment, consequently eliminating a major source of inefficiency, inequality and social instability that arises from violent cyclical shifts under capitalism.\n\nMilton Friedman criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on 'models of imaginary worlds' rather than 'generalizations about the real world', making the claims of the model immune to falsification. He also criticized the model on logical grounds, by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state: any time an individual started a private enterprise, the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.\n\n\n\n"}

In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, it is possible for the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, Turku. On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.\n\nOf the 317 Finnish municipalities, 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking majority and 18 a Finnish-speaking one. Four municipalities, all located in Lapland, have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: Enontekiö, Inari, Sodankylä and Utsjoki. Initially, only Swedish was accorded official bilingualism, through a language act of 1922; similar provisions were extended to Sami through a 1991 law. The 1922 law was replaced by new but largely similar legislation in 2003.\n\n"}

Looming refers to the rapid expansion in the size of any given image.

Evidence indicates that looming perception is not limited to the visual modality, but can occur due to auditory or even tactile stimuli. \n\nThere is a different type of mirage that is also described as looming, in which distant objects appear much nearer than they actually are, is explained in the same way as the image of the ship, except that the image is not inverted; the density variations may also act as a magnifying glass.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2050441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2050441", "title": "Marco Materazzi", "text": "Marco Materazzi\n\nMarco Materazzi, (; born 19 August 1973) is an Italian former professional footballer and manager.\n\nEarly in his career, Materazzi played with various Italian teams in Serie B and Serie C, and with Everton in the Premier League. He spent two periods with Perugia (1995–98 and 1999–2001) and signed for Internazionale in 2001 for €10 million. At club level, he won a number of major honors with Inter, including five Serie A league titles in a row from 2006 to 2010, one UEFA Champions League, one FIFA Club World Cup, four Coppa Italia titles, and the Supercoppa Italiana four times.\n\nMaterazzi earned 41 caps for Italy from his debut in 2001 until 2008, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He was one of the key players in the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final against France, as he scored Italy's goal and later, in extra time, he received a headbutt from Zinedine Zidane, who was punished with a red card. Italy then went on to win the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out, during which Materazzi scored again.\n\nA controversial and provocative figure in football, he was known for his very physical and aggressive style of play as a defender, as well as his tight marking and strong, harsh tackling, which led him to receive more than 60 yellow cards and 25 red cards throughout his playing career. Due to his temper, and his commitment to rash, heavy challenges, he has been involved in several altercations with other players during matches, drawing comparisons with retired defender Pasquale Bruno. \"The Times\" placed Materazzi at number 45 in their list of the 50 hardest football players in history.\n\nMaterazzi began his footballing career with the Lazio and then the Messina Peloro youth teams from 1990 to 1991. He spent his early career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with amateur side Tor di Quinto (1991–92), Serie C2 team Marsala (1993–94), and Serie C1 Trapani (1994–95), where he narrowly missed a historic promotion to Serie B after losing a promotion playoff to Gualdo. Serie B squad Perugia Calcio signed Materazzi for the first time in 1995, but he spent a part of the 1996–97 season in Serie C with Carpi.\n\nHe then spent 1998–99 with Everton, where he was sent off three times in just 27 games, and scored twice, against Middlesbrough in the league and Huddersfield Town in the League Cup.\n\nHe then returned to Perugia in 1999 and scored 12 goals, including 7 from penalties in the 2000–01 season, breaking Daniel Passarella's Serie A record of most goals by a defender in one season.\n\nMaterazzi was signed by Internazionale in July 2001 for €10 million. He took squad number 23 and made his competitive debut for the club on 26 August in the opening championship match against Perugia. Materazzi's first goal for Inter came only in his second appearance, netting inside 10 minutes in a 2–2 draw at Parma. He also played eight time in the season's UEFA Cup, with the debuting match coming on 20 September in the 3–0 win versus Romania's Brașov. \n\nMaterazzi played 23 matches in league, including the final decisive match versus Lazio which lost Inter the championship title; he was a protagonist of a controversy episode following the final whistle as he was included in a heated discussion with the opposite players which also went to physical confrontation. He was caught by the cameras shouting at Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta, saying: \"I won you the title\", in reference to Perugia's win over Juventus in 2000 which lead Lazio to the title.\n\nIn the following season, Materazzi made 33 appearances across all competitions, including 13 in UEFA Champions League, where he played his first match on 14 August 2002 in a goalless draw against Sporting CP. \n\nMaterazzi's 2003–04 season was highlighted by injuries, such as the one he suffered on 25 November during the 5–1 home loss to Arsenal in UEFA Champions League group stage which kept him out of action for two months. He was in the center of a controversy again in the beginning of 2004 for aggression towards Siena player Bruno Cirillo. This happened on 1 February in a match which was won 4–0 by Inter. Materazzi (who did not play in the match) confronted Cirillo in the dressing rooms and begun spewing insults towards him. He also punched him in the face, fracturing his lip. After the incident was denounced, the sports judge Maurizio Laudi suspended Materazzi until 29 March, meaning that he will miss eight club matches and one international match. In addition to his domestic suspension, Materazzi was also suspended by UEFA for two UEFA Cup games. Inter was also fined with €5,000. Materazzi later apologized for the incident, saying that he \"behaved badly\" and \"reacted in a bad way\", also adding that he would not appeal the suspension.\n\nIn July 2004, at the start of 2004–05 season, Inter bench was entrusted to manager Roberto Mancini, with whom – in the first season – Materazzi lost his place in the starting lineup. In the next season he played more, and was the only Italian to score a goal for the club that season. On 5 March 2006, Materazzi scored a 89th-minute header at Roma to rescue his side a point and to break the hosts' record of 11 consecutive victories. He finished the 2005–06 season by totaling 39 appearances across all competitions.\n\nMaterazzi signed a new contract in August 2006 which kept him at San Siro until June 2010. At the end of the year he was a nominee for UEFA Team of the Year along with teammate Fabio Grosso. The 2006–07 season saw him scoring 10 goals, thus being the top scoring defender of Serie A. He notably scored in the 4–3 win in Derby della Madonnina against Milan, an overhead kick versus Messina and a brace away to Siena on 23 April which won the club's 15th league title with five games remaining. For his performances, Materazzi was voted the Serie A Defender of the Year.\nMaterazzi missed the first part of 2007–08 season due to an injury suffered whilst on international duty which forced him to be sidelined until November 2007. Later in February of the following year, Materazzi gave a poor display in the first leg of 2007–08 UEFA Champions League first knockout round against Liverpool, receiving a red card in the 30th minute, as Inter lost 2–0 at Anfield. His performance was criticised by his teammates after the end of the match. Later on throughout the season, during a 2–2 draw against Siena, Materazzi argued with striker Julio Ricardo Cruz on who to take a penalty kick. Eventually it was Materazzi who took it but his attempt was easily saved by Alex Manninger. It was his first miss since 2001. The draw spoiled Inter's chances of winning the title with one game to spare. After the match, the choice to take the penalty was criticized by manager Roberto Mancini while Materazzi himself apologized, stating that it should have been Cruz the one to take it. Inter eventually won the championship for the third consecutive time after defeating Parma 2–0 in the last matchday with Materazzi playing full-90 minutes. He concluded the season with 23 Serie A appearances, 4 Coppa Italia appearances, 1 Supercoppa Italiana appearance and 3 UEFA Champions League appearances for a total of 33 appearances.\n\nThe summer of 2008 saw the arrival of Portuguese manager José Mourinho who did not saw Materazzi as the first choice in defence, relegating him to the bench. Apart from that, his season was also marred by injuries, which reduced his league tally to only 8 appearances. He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal on 4 November in a 3–3 draw at Anorthosis in the Group B matchday 4. Materazzi won his 4th championship on 17 May 2009 following Inter's 3–0 defeat of Siena. Despite playing rarely, he was still praised by president Massimo Moratti who said that Materazzi \"always played well whenever he was called upon last season\" while manager Mourinho stated that he wanted to have Materazzi in his team.\nIn June 2009, Materazzi was handed a new deal by Inter until June 2012. He was used sparingly during the 2009–10 season, making 20 appearances in all competitions. In January 2010, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damage to the medial meniscus in his right knee which kept him sidelined for one month. Materazzi was an injury-time substitute for Inter in the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich, replacing Diego Milito who scored both of their goals in the 2–0 victory in Madrid. In addition to that, Inter also clinched the \"Scudetto\", for the fifth season in a row, and Coppa Italia, to complete the Treble.\n\nHe begun the 2010–11 season by coming on in the last minutes of a 3–1 home win over Roma in the Supercoppa Italiana match. Materazzi's first league match of the season came later in November where he started in the derby against Milan due to the absence of Walter Samuel; he conceded a penalty in 4th minute for fouling Zlatan Ibrahimović and was later sent to hospital after a receiving a kung-fu kick in the stomach by the Swede. Inter lost the match 1–0. Following the end of the match, manager Rafael Benítez calmed the situation by stating that Materazzi's injury \"doesn't seem serious\". He returend in action two weeks later by playing full-90 minutes in a 5–2 home win over Parma. In December, Materazzi was included in Inter's squad for 2010 FIFA Club World Cup, remaining on the bench as Inter won their 5th title of the year. \n\nMaterazzi left the club in July 2011 after not being offered a new contract, having played around 270 games for the club and winning 15 trophies, and shortly after, announced his retirement from the sport. He was later appointed in the role of ambassador to Inter. Later, Materazzi accused manager Leonardo of \"stabbed him in the back\" and the reason of his departure from Inter, and also threw accusations to president Massimo Moratti of not having defended him against Leonardo.\n\nOn 22 September 2014, Materazzi was signed as the player-manager of Chennaiyin FC in the inaugural season of the Indian Super League. Materazzi signed a two-season contract with Chennaiyin for $1 million (USD) every season. Materazzi did not choose himself to play in their opening match, a 2–1 victory at FC Goa on 15 October courtesy of a free kick from marquee player and former Brazil international Elano. Six days later in his first home game, Chennaiyin defeated the Kerala Blasters 2–1, but four days after that he lost for the first time, 1–4 to the Delhi Dynamos. In the club's fourth match of the season, he selected himself to play for the first time, starting in a 5–1 win over Mumbai City. On 28 November, he brought his former international defensive partner Alessandro Nesta out of retirement to play for Chennaiyin until the end of the season. Chennaiyin finished the 14-game regular season in first place in the league, with Materazzi having made 6 appearances. In the end-of-season play-offs, the team were eliminated in extra time in the semi-finals by the Kerala Blasters.\n\nAt the end of the 2015 season, in which Materazzi led Chennaiyin to the Indian Super League championship, his contract ended. After the conclusion of the 2016 season, it was announced that Materazzi would not return to the club for 2017.\n\nMaterazzi made his debut for the Italy national team on 25 April 2001, in a 1–0 friendly match victory against South Africa. He made two appearances in the qualifying campaign against Georgia and Hungary. In the final tournament of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Materazzi was used as a reserve player to back up Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. He made only one appearance by coming on as a substitute for Nesta in the 2–1 loss to Croatia in the group stage but soon in the 90th minute Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over half way to Inzaghi but everyone missed the ball and it rolled in the back of the net but the goal was disallowed after referee Graham Poll claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponent's shirt. Materazzi was later criticised for his defending on both of Croatia's goals during the match.\n\nDespite a long suspension with Inter, Materazzi was still called up by manager Giovanni Trapattoni for the UEFA Euro 2004, where he was on the bench for Italy's first two games but started in the final group game against Bulgaria in place of the suspended Fabio Cannavaro, as Italy came from behind to win 2–1; in the first half, Materazzi was judged to have allegedly fouled Dimitar Berbatov in the area, conceding a penalty, which Martin Petrov subsequently converted. Despite the win, Italy were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Denmark and Sweden.\n\nMaterazzi played his first match as captain for Italy on 17 November 2004 in a 1–0 friendly win over Finland in which he also received a yellow card. His second and final match as captain came in another friendly against Iceland on 30 March 2005 where he played in the first half.\n\nMaterazzi was included in the 23-man squad by manager Marcelo Lippi for the 2006 FIFA World Cup which was his third major tournament. He begun the tournament as a reserve player, but after Alessandro Nesta suffered an injury in the group match against the Czech Republic, Materazzi came on as his replacement and made an impact by scoring a goal, and was named Man of the Match. He received a red card in the round of 16 match against Australia for a foul on Mark Bresciano, which ended in a 1–0 win to the Italians, and was suspended for the quarter-final against Ukraine, which Italy won 3–0. In the final against France, Materazzi fouled Florent Malouda to concede a penalty, which Zinedine Zidane subsequently scored. He made another impact by scoring a goal to level the score, a header from a right sided corner by Andrea Pirlo. After the match went to extra-time, Materazzi and Zidane were involved in a confrontation in the 110th minute, where Materazzi verbally insulted Zinedine Zidane alongside tugging his shirt while Zidane attempted to walk away, which ended with Zidane head-butting Materazzi and receiving a red card. The game then continued to penalties. Materazzi scored Italy's second penalty as they defeated France 5–3 to claim their fourth FIFA World Cup. After the final, the confrontation resulted in a major controversy as Zidane accused Materazzi of insulting his sister and mother. Additionally, Materazzi claimed that after he had grabbed Zidane's jersey, Zidane sarcastically said to him \"If you want my shirt, I will give to you afterwards\". Materazzi then revealed that he replied, \"Preferisco la puttana di tua sorella\" (\"I would prefer your whore of a sister\"), which resulted in the head-butt. Three British tabloid newspapers, the \"Daily Star\", the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Sun\", alleged that Materazzi had called Zidane \"the son of a terrorist whore.\" Materazzi took legal action against all three newspapers and the allegations were later withdrawn. FIFA later issued a CHF 5,000 fine and a two-match ban against Materazzi. Alongside striker Luca Toni, Materazzi was Italy's top scorer throughout the tournament with two goals; he also won 14 challenges throughout the competition.\n\nUnder Roberto Donadoni, Materazzi appeared consistently during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign and became a starter after Alessandro Nesta's retirement. In the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, he started in the 3–0 loss to the Netherlands but was substituted in the 54th minute in what would later prove to be his final appearance for Italy, as he was replaced later in the tournament by Giorgio Chiellini. Later, after Lippi's return, Materazzi was not called in the national team again. He totaled 41 appearances and 2 goals for Italy.\n\nAn aggressive, physical, and hard-tackling centre-back, who was also known for his tight marking of opponents, Materazzi was considered to be one of the best defenders of his generation, and was highly regarded by two of the world's most respected coaches, Marcello Lippi and José Mourinho, later becoming close friends with both managers. Materazzi was lauded by his managers in particular for being a goal threat as a defender, due to his outstanding aerial ability, which made him dangerous during set pieces. His prolific goalscoring allowed him to capture the record for most goals in a Serie A season by a defender, which was broken during the 2000–01 season. He was also an accurate set piece and penalty kick taker, with a powerful shot from distance. In addition to these attributes, he had solid technical skills and reliable distribution, and was known for frequently playing long balls to the strikers. During his time with Internazionale, he developed the nickname \"Matrix\".\n\nMarco Materazzi was born in Lecce, where his father, Giuseppe, a professional footballer, was playing for U.S. Lecce. Giuseppe was also a former football coach and manager of teams such as Pisa, Lazio, Sporting CP and Tianjin Teda. Materazzi's mother died when he was 15 years old. His sister, Monia married Maurizio Maestrelli, the son of former manager Tommaso Maestrelli; he died on 28 November 2011. His brother Matteo is a sports agent.\n\nAs stated by his father, Marco grew up a supporter of Lazio. In September 2007, he released his autobiography called \"Una vita da guerriero\" (A life as a warrior) published by journalists Andrea Elefante (from Gazzetta dello Sport) and Roberto De Ponti (from Corriere della Sera).\n\nMaterazzi was married on 23 June 1997 with Daniela, whom he has three children: Anna, Davide and Gianmarco. \n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\"Italy score listed first, score column indicates score after each Materazzi goal.\"\n\nAll competitive league games (league and domestic cup) and international matches (including friendlies) are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4620735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4620735", "title": "Merit (Buddhism)", "text": "Merit (Buddhism)\n\nMerit (', ') is a concept considered fundamental to Buddhist ethics. It is a beneficial and protective force which accumulates as a result of good deeds, acts, or thoughts. Merit-making is important to Buddhist practice: merit brings good and agreeable results, determines the quality of the next life and contributes to a person's growth towards enlightenment. In addition, merit is also shared with a deceased loved one, in order to help the deceased in their new existence. Despite modernization, merit-making remains essential in traditional Buddhist countries and has had a significant impact on the rural economies in these countries.\n\nMerit is connected with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; it is capable of attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (\"papa\"), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.\n\nMerit can be gained in a number of ways, such as giving, virtue and mental development. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making described in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of \"kusala\" (\"Sanskrit: kusala\") is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (\"Sanskrit: Dharma\"), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.\n\nIn modern society, merit-making has been criticized as materialist, but merit-making is still ubiquitous in many societies. Examples of the impact of beliefs about merit-making can be seen in the \"Phu Mi Bun\" rebellions which took place in the last centuries, as well as in the revival of certain forms of merit-making, such as the much discussed merit release.\n\n literally translates as 'merit, meritorious action, virtue'. It is glossed by the Theravāda Commentator Dhammapāla as \"santanaṃ punāti visodheti\", meaning 'it cleans or purifies the life-continuity'. Its opposites are \"apuñña\" (demerit) or \"pāpa\" ('infertile, barren, harmful, bringing ill fortune'), of which the term \"pāpa\" has become most common. The term , originally a Judeo-Christian term, has in the latter part of the twentieth century gradually been used as a translation of the Buddhist term \"puṇya\" or \"puñña\". The Buddhist term has, however, more of an impermanent character than the English translation implies, and the Buddhist term does not imply a sense of \"deserving\".\n\nBefore the arising of Buddhism, merit was commonly used in the context of Brahmanical sacrifice, and it was believed that merit accrued through such sacrifice would bring the devotee to an eternal heaven of the 'fathers' . Later, in the period of the Upanishads, a concept of rebirth was established and it was believed that life in heaven was determined by the merit accumulated in previous lives, but the focus on the \"pitṛ\" did not really change. In Buddhism, the idea of an eternal heaven was rejected, but it was believed that merit could help achieve a rebirth in a temporary heaven. Merit was no longer merely a product of ritual, but was invested with an ethical meaning and role.\n\nIn the Tipiṭaka (\"\"; the Buddhist scriptures), the importance of merit is often stressed. Merit is generally considered fundamental to Buddhist ethics, in nearly all Buddhist traditions. Merit-making is very important to Buddhist practice in Buddhist societies.\n\nMerit is a \"beneficial and protective force which extends over a long period of time\" (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds (', ') done through physical action, words, or thought. As its Pāli language (the language of Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, etc.) definition indicates, this force is associated with goodness and purity of mind. In traditional Buddhist societies, it is believed that merit is more sustainable than that of magical rites, spirit worship or worldly power. The way merit works, is that acts of merit bring good and agreeable results, whereas demeritorious acts bring bad and disagreeable results. A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This (\"\") or \"automatic cosmic reaction\" (Brokaw) is a common idea found in Buddhist texts and Buddhist societies, and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways. Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it. Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous. Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits. The merits and demerits a person has done may take a while to bear fruit. Merit or demerit may cause a good or bad future respectively, including in the next lives to come. A bad destination after rebirth may be caused by demerit, but merely a lack of merit may also lead a person to be born in an unhappy destination. When someone is reborn in a happy destination, however, one can only stay there as long as merits last. Thus, it is stated in the Tipiṭaka that people cannot take anything with them when they die, except for whatever merit and demerit they have done, which will affect their future. Merit can be accumulated in different quantities, and stored up, but also has an impermanent character: it can run out. Summarizing from the Buddhist text Milinda Pañhā, some scholars conclude that merit is inherently stronger than demerit. Moreover, many merits together have the power to prevent demerits from having an effect, by pushing them \"to the back of the queue\" (Richard Gombrich), though demerits can never be undone.\n\nAll these benefits of merit ('; '), whether internal or external, are the aim in merit-making, and are often subject of Dharma teachings and texts. Thus, merit is the foundation of heavenly bliss in the future, and in some countries merit was also considered to contribute to the good fortune of the country. Because merit is understood to have these many beneficial effects, it is sometimes compared with cool water, which is poured or which is bathed in. This symbol is used in merit transfer ceremonies, for example.\n\nMerit is not only a concept, but also a way of living. The Pāli canon identifies three bases of merit (\"), in order of difficulty:\nIn Buddhist texts and practice, giving is considered the easiest of the three bases of merit. It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind for the practice of virtue. It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive back what they have given. As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the eight-fold path, the path central in the Buddhist teaching: right speech, right action and right livelihood. Being the main criterion for moral behavior in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of five precepts, although the eight precepts may be kept now and then. The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy. The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (\"\")—happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana. When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can take someone to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.\n\nPost-canonical texts and commentaries such as the Dhammasaṅganī and Atthasālinī, elaborating on the three bases of merit, state that lay devotees can make merit by performing ten deeds. Seven items are then added to the previous three:\n\nThese ten, the Commentator Buddhaghosa says, all fit within the three first bases of merit: 'Giving' includes 'Transferring merit to others' and 'Rejoicing in others' merit' by extension, whereas 'Virtue' includes 'Honoring others' and 'Offering service'. The remaining items 'Listening to Teachings', 'Instructing others in the Teachings' and 'Straightening one's own views' are part of 'Mental development'. Thus, in Theravāda Buddhism, merit is always accrued through morally (good) actions. Such good deeds are also highly valued in the other two Buddhist schools, that is Mahāyāna (China, Japan, etc.) and Vajrayāna (Tibet, Nepal, etc.). In some forms of Mahāyāna or Vajrayāna it is believed, however, that even more merit will accrue from certain ritual actions, sometimes called the 'power of blessed substances' \"()\". These are considered an addition to the traditional list and can help protect against calamities or other negative events caused by bad karma.\n\nA number of scholars have criticized the concepts of merit and karma as amoral, egoist and calculative, citing its quantitative nature and emphasis on personal benefits in observing morality. Other scholars have pointed out that in Buddhist ethics egoism and altruism may not be as strictly separated as in western thought, personal benefit and that of the other becoming one as the practitioner progresses on the spiritual path. Buddhist ethics is informed by Buddhist metaphysics, notably, the not-self doctrine, and therefore some western ethical concepts may not apply. Besides, as Keown notices, moral action would not be possible if it was not preceded by moral concern for others, as is illustrated by the example of the Buddha himself. Such moral concern is also part of the Buddhist path, cultivated through loving-kindness and the other sublime attitudes (\"\").\nIn post-canonical and vernacular Pāli literature, such as the Jātaka stories of the Buddha's previous lives, the Avadānas and Anisaṃsa texts, as well as in many Mahāyāna texts, merit is the main concept. It is regarded as something which can be accumulated throughout different lifetimes in the process of attaining Buddhahood, and is also instrumental in attaining it. The \"Bodhisatta\" intent on accomplishing Buddhahood and bringing other beings across the ocean of suffering, must do so by accumulating all sorts of merits, in this context also called perfections ('; '). This form of merit-making is always led by a vow for enlightenment ('; '), and an intention to enlighten others as well, as well as the transferring of merits to all living beings to that effect. Another aspect of meritorious acts, emphasized more in later literature, is the idea that a single meritorious act done will reap many fruits, as, for example, expressed in the Vimānavatthu. Not only is the quality of people's next rebirth affected by their merits, but also the circumstances in which they are reborn; not only in the next life, but also in adjacent lives after that. Wealth, lifespan, and position are all contingent on merit.\n\nIn Buddhist texts further details are given in what way and to what extent a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual attitude of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually \"not worthy of the gift\", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard to the size of the gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (\"\").\n\nA teaching that exists in both Mahāyāna \"sūtras\" and Theravādin \"suttas\" is the teaching on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action (\"\"). In Mahāyāna, this teaching is described as the way in which a \"Bodhisattva\" prevents \"suffering in all evil destinies\". These ten wholesome ways are:\n\nThese ten actions are described as ('unwholesome'; '), and when abstaining from them it is called ('wholesome'; '). Moreover, \"kusala\" and \"akusala\" are depicted as having 'roots' (\"mūla\"). \"Akusalamūla\" are the roots of evil in the mind (the defilements), whereas the \"kusalamūla\" are roots connected with good qualities of the mind. Both of them are called \"roots\" because they are qualities that can be cultivated and grown in the mind.\n\n\"Puñña\" and \"pāpa\" are close in meaning to \"kusala\" and \"akusala\". Both pairs are used for distinguishing between ethically right and wrong. However, even though the negatives \"akusala\" and \"pāpa\" have almost the same meaning, there are some differences between the positives, \"kusala\" and \"puñña\". According to P. D. Premasiri, \"Kusala\" is used to describe a more direct path to Nirvana than \"puñña\". Damien Keown, however, believes they are merely different angles of the same concept: \"kusala\" refers to the moral status of an action, whereas \"puñña\" refers to the experience of the consequences of the action. He further points out that in the Pāli (discourses) mental development (\"bhāvanā\") practices such as meditation are also included in the path of merit. It is unlikely that in the Tipiṭaka meditation would be regarded as an indirect path or obstacle to Nirvana, and there are passages that directly relate merit to Nirvana. Sometimes a distinction is made between worldly (') and transcendental (') merit, in which only transcendental merit leads to liberation. The Thai scholar and monastic Phra Payutto believes that \"merit\" and \"kusala\" are both used to describe the 'cleanliness of the mind' (). But whereas \"merit\" aims for the 'beautiful and praiseworthy' () aspect of such cleanliness, with worldly benefits such as wealth, praise and happiness; \"kusala\" aims for the 'purity' () aspect of cleanliness, with enlightenment as its benefit. Phra Payutto does add that both need to be accumulated on the Buddhist path. In making this comparison, he says this only holds for worldly merit, not for transcendental merit. Collins equates transcendental merit with \"kusala\". In the earlier Pāli texts, \"kusala\" was much more commonly used than \"puñña\", \"puñña\" mostly being used in the context of the practice of giving.\n\nIn a widely quoted theory, Melford Spiro and Winston King have distinguished two forms of Buddhism found in traditional Buddhist societies, \"kammatic Buddhism\" focused on activities such as merit-making, and \"nibbanic Buddhism\" which focuses on the liberation from suffering and rebirth. In this theory, called the \"transcendency thesis\" (Keown), Buddhism has two quite separate aims, which are pursued by separate groups, that is, laypeople (kammatic) and monks (nibbanic). This view has, however, been downplayed or criticized by many other scholars, who believe that kammatic practices are in many ways connected to nibbanic practices, and the aims of monks and laypeople cannot be that easily separated.\n\nThis transcendency thesis has also been applied to scriptural interpretation. When discussing the path to the attainment of Nirvana, in some passages in the Tipiṭaka merit is rejected. For example, in the Padhāna Sutta, the \"Bodhisatta\" (the Buddha Gotama to be) is tempted by \"Māra\" to give up his self-torture practices to do meritorious acts instead. The \"Bodhisatta\" replies that even a bit of merit is no use to him (\"\"). Some scholars, supporting the transcendency thesis, have interpreted this to mean that merit can only lead to happiness and progress within \"Saṃsāra\", but does not lead to Nirvana, and must in fact be discarded before attaining Nirvana. Marasinghe believes, however, that the word \"merit\" in this passage refers to merit in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical sense, connected with rituals and sacrifice, and the lay life. Another example often quoted in this context is the simile of the raft, which states that both \"dhamma\" and \"adhamma\" should be let go of in order to attain liberation. Whereas the term \"adhamma\" in the text clearly refers to evil views, the meaning of \"dhamma\" is subject to different interpretations. Considering that no other similar passage can be found in the Tipiṭaka, Keown believes that only this passage is not enough to base the transcendency thesis on.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, an enlightened person is said to be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit. Some scholars have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is neutral. Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (\"adhisīla\"). Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, \"puñña\"), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They no longer need to strive for a happy rebirth in the next life, because they have gone beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an perfection as well, though this is solely described as \"kusala\", not as \"puñña\".\n\n In pre-Buddhist Brahmanism, Brahmin priests used to perform \"s\" (sacrifices) and thereby generating merit for the donors who provided gifts for the sacrifice. In Buddhism, it was the Buddhist monk who assumed this role, considered qualified to receive generosity from devotees and thereby generating merit for them. He came to be described as \"āhuneyyo\" ('worthy of offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical term \"āhavanīya\" ('worthy of sacrifice', used in offerings to the ritual fire); and as \"dakkhiṇeyyo\" ('qualified to accept the offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical \"dakśiṇā\", the sacrificial offering itself. The Sangha (monastic community) was also described as ('; '). The difference with the Brahmanical tradition was, according to Marasinghe, that Buddhism did recognize ways of generating merit apart from offerings to the monk, whereas the Brahmanical \"yajña\" emphasized offerings to the Brahmin priest. That is not to say that such offerings were not important in early Buddhism: giving to the Sangha was the first Buddhist activity which allowed for community participation, and preceded the first rituals in Buddhism.\n\nThe main concept of the field of merit is that good deeds done towards some recipients accrue more merit than good deeds to other recipients. This is compared with a seed planted in fertile ground which reaps more and better fruits than in infertile ground. The Sangha is described as a field of merit, mostly because the members of the Sangha follow the eight-fold path. But in many texts, the Buddha and the Dhamma, and their representations, are also described as fields of merit. For example, Mahāyāna tradition considers production and reverence of Dharma texts very meritorious—this tradition, sometimes referred to as the \"cult of the book\" (Gregory Schopen), stimulated the development of print technology in China. In other traditions a Buddha image is also considered a field of merit, and any good deed involving a Buddha image is considered very meritorious. A meritorious deed will also be very valuable (and sometimes viewed in terms of a field of merit) if performed to repay gratitude to someone (such as parents), or performed out of compassion for those who suffer. Deeds of merit done towards the Sangha as a whole yield greater fruits than deeds done towards one particular recipient (\"\") or deeds done with favoritism. Indeed, \"saṅghadāna\" yields even more fruits than deeds of merit to the person of the Buddha himself.\n\nThe ten bases of merit are very popular in Buddhist countries. In China, other similar lists are also well-known. In Thai Buddhism, the word \"merit\" () is often combined with \"to do, to make\" (), and this expression is frequently used, especially in relation to giving. In Buddhist societies, such merit-making is common, especially those meritorious deeds which are connected to monks and temples. In this regard, there is a saying in Burma, \"Your hands are always close to offering donations\". Contrary to popular conceptions, merit-making is done by both monastics and laypeople alike. Buddhist monks or lay Buddhists earn merit through mindfulness, meditation, chanting and other rituals. Giving is the fundamental way of making merit for many laypeople, as monks are not allowed to cook by themselves. Monastics in their turn practice themselves to be a good field of merit and make merit by teaching the donors. Merit-making has thus created a symbiotic relationship between laypeople and Sangha, and the Sangha is obligated to be accessible to laypeople, for them to make merit.\n\nGiving can be done in several ways. Some laypeople offer food, others offer robes and supplies, and others fund ceremonies, build monasteries or persuade a relative to ordain as a monk. Young people often temporary ordain as monks, because they believe this will not only yield fruits of merit for themselves, but also for their parents who have allowed them to ordain. In China, Thailand and India, it used to be common to offer land or the first harvest to a monastery. Also, more socially oriented activities such as building a hospital or bridge, or giving to the poor are included in the Tipiṭaka, and by many Buddhists considered meritorious. In fieldwork studies done by researchers, devotees appreciated the merits of becoming ordained and supporting the building of a temple the most. Fisher found that building a temple was considered a great merit by devotees, because they believed they would in that way have part in all the wisdom which would be taught at that temple. People may pursue merit-making for different reasons, as Buddhist orthodoxy allows for various ideals, this-worldly or ultimate. Although many scholars have pointed out that devotees often aim for this-worldly benefits in merit-making, it has also been pointed out that in old age, people tend to make merit with a view on the next life and liberation. Among lay people, women tend to engage in merit-making more than men, and this may be a way for them to enhance empowerment. Very often, merit-making is done as a group, and it is believed that such shared merit-making will cause people to be born together in next lives. This belief holds for families, friends, communities and even the country as a whole. In some cases, merit-making took the form of a community-wide competition, in which different donors tried to outdo each other to prove their generosity and social status. This was the case during merit-making festivals in nineteenth-century Thailand. In modern Thailand, businesses and politicians often make merit to improve their public image and increase confidence among customers or voters. In Burma, lay devotees form associations to engage in merit-making as a community. People were so intent on merit-making and giving, that in some societies, people would even offer and their family to a Buddhist temple, as one high-ranking minister did in the ancient Pagan Kingdom (ninth until fourteenth century Burma). On a similar note, in Sri Lanka, kings and commoners would offer slaves to the temple, and then donate money to pay for their freedom, that way accruing two merits at once. Even more symbolically, kings would sometimes offer their kingdom to a temple, which, returned the gift immediately, together with some Dhamma teaching. Also in Sri Lanka, King Mahakuli Mahatissa disguised himself as a peasant and started to earn his living working on a paddy field, so he would be able to gain more merit by working himself to obtain resources to give to Buddhist monks. In some cases, merit-making was even continued after a person's death: in ancient Thai tradition, it was considered meritorious for people to dedicate their corpses to feed the wild animals after death.\n\nMany devout Buddhists observe regular \"rest days\" (\"\") by keeping five precepts, listening to teachings, practicing meditation and living at the temple. Besides these weekly observances, ceremonies and festivities are yearly held and are often occasions to make merit, and are sometimes believed to yield greater merits than other, ordinary days. In Thailand and Laos, a yearly festival is held focused on the Vessantara Jātaka, a story of a previous life of the Buddha which is held sacred. This festival, seven centuries old, played a major role in legitimating kingship in Thai society. Making merit is the central theme of the festival. Since the period of Rama IV, however, the festival has become less popular. Many countries also celebrate the yearly Kaṭhina, when they offer robes, money and other requisites to the Sangha as a way to make merit. In Burma, the two yearly Light Festivals are typically occasions to make merit, as gifts are given to elders, and robes are sewn for the Sangha. In South Korea, a Buddha Day is held, on which Buddhists pray and offer alms. Other kinds of occasions of merit-making are also uphold. A special form of merit-making less frequently engaged in is going on pilgrimage, which is mostly common in Tibet and Japan. This practice is highly regarded and considered very meritorious.\n\nIn several Buddhist countries, it has been common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' (). Although a belief in merit and retribution had preceded the merit ledgers by many centuries, during the Ming dynasty, through the ledgers a practice of systematic merit accumulation was established for the first time. The merit ledgers were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized in the form of a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. The ledgers also listed the exact retributions of every number of deeds done, to the detail. Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma. In the fourth century CE, the \"Baopuzi\", and in the twelfth century the \"Treatise On the Response of the Tao\" and the \"Ledger of Merit and Demerit of the Taiwei Immortal\" introduced the basics of the system of merit ledgers. In the fourteenth century CE, the Tao master Zhao Yizhen recommended the use of the ledgers to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason. From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and the usage of the ledgers grew widespread. The practice of recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day. In Theravāda countries, for example in Burma and Sri Lanka, similar customs have been observed. In Sri Lanka, a (', ') was sometimes kept by someone for years and read in the last moments of life. This practice was based on the story of King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi, and was mostly practiced by the royalty and rich during the period of the Mahāvaṁsa chronicle. More recent practice has also been observed, for example, as a form of terminal care. or as part of the activities of lay merit-making associations.\n\nThe association of wealth with merits done has deeply affected many Buddhist countries. The relation between giving and wealth is ubiquitous in vernacular Pāli literature, and many stories of exemplary donors exist, such as the stories of Anāthapiṇḍika and Jōtika. In Buddhism, by emphasizing the usage of wealth for generosity, accumulating wealth for giving purposes thus became a spiritual practice. But using wealth in unrighteous ways, or hoarding it instead of sharing and giving it, is condemned extensively. Greed is what keeps a person wandering in \"Saṃsāra\" (the cycle of rebirth), instead of becoming liberated. It is the attachment to wealth that is an obstacle on the spiritual path, not wealth per se. Stories illustrating these themes in vernacular Buddhist literature, have profoundly influenced popular culture in Buddhist countries. Several scholars have described merit as a sort of spiritual currency or bookkeeping system. Though objections have been made against this metaphor, it is not new. Similar comparisons have been made in the Milinda Pañhā, and in seventeenth-century China. Moreover, Schopen has shown that Buddhism has had strong connections with the mercantile class, and Rotman thinks that a mercantile ethos may have informed Buddhist texts such as the Divyāvadāna. Gombrich objects to calling merit-making \"dry metaphysical mercantilism\", but he does speculate on a historical relation between the concept of merit and the monetization of ancient India's economy.\n\nTwo practices mentioned in the list of meritorious acts have been studied quite extensively by scholars: dedicating (or transferring) merit to others, and rejoicing in others' merits. Transferring merit is a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Theravāda. In the Pāli tradition, the word \"pattidāna\" is used, meaning 'giving of the acquired'. And in the Sanskrit tradition, the word \"pariṇāmanā\" is used for transferring merit, meaning 'bending round or towards, transfer, dedication'. Of these translations, 'transfer of merit' has become commonplace, though objected to by some scholars.\n\nBuddhist traditions provide detailed descriptions of how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word \"transfer\", the merit of the giver is in no way decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the \"devas\" (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.\n\nInitially in the Western study of Buddhism, some scholars believed that the transfer of merit was a uniquely Mahāyāna practice and that it was developed only at a late period after the historical Buddha. For example, Heinz Bechert dated the Buddhist doctrine of transfer of merit in its fully developed form to the period between the fifth and seventh centuries CE. Scholars perceived that it was discordant with early Buddhist understandings of karma, and noticed that in the Kathāvatthu the idea is partly refuted by Theravādins. Other scholars have pointed out that the doctrine of the transfer of merit can be found early in the Theravāda tradition. Then there also scholars who propose that, although the transfer of merit did not exist in early Buddhism, early doctrines did form a basis for it, the transfer of merit being an \"inherent consequence\" (Bechert) of these early doctrines.\n\nThe idea that a certain power could be transferred from one to another was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the Mahābhārata, it is described that \"devas\" can transfer certain powers ('). A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by performing austerities ('). Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in Brahamanical ancestor worship. In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering \"preta\" to reach the blissful world of the \"pitṛs.\" This was done through the complex \"Śrāddha\" ceremonies, which would secure the destiny of the deceased as a \"pitṛ\". In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma. Nevertheless, the practice of transfer of merit arose by using the ethical and psychological principles of karma and merit, and connect these with the sense of responsibility towards one's parents. This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. As for the veneration of dead ancestors, this was replaced by veneration of the Sangha.\n\nSree Padma and Anthony Barber note that merit transfer was well-established and a very integral part of Buddhist practice in the Andhra region of southern India. In addition, inscriptions at numerous sites across South Asia provide definitive evidence that the transfer of merit was widely practiced in the first few centuries CE. In Theravāda Buddhism, it has become customary for donors to share merits during ceremonies held at intervals, and during a teaching. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, it is believed that \"Bodhisattvas\" in the heavens are capable of transferring merits, and will do so to help relief the suffering of their devotees, who then can dedicate it to others. This concept has led to several Buddhist traditions focused on devotion. Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhists transfer merits as part of the 'Seven-part-worship' (\"\"), and there is almost no ceremony without some form of merit transfer. Thus, merit transfer has developed to become a standard element in the basic liturgy of all main schools of Buddhism. Indeed, the transfer of merits has grown that important in Buddhism, that it has become a major way for Buddhism to sustain itself. In Japan, some temples are even called \"ekōdera\", which means a temple for merit transfer.\n\nIn South and South-East Asia, merit-making was not only a practice for the mass, but was also practiced by the higher echelons of society. Kingship and merit-making went together. In the Tipiṭaka, ideas about good governance were framed in terms of the ideal of the 'wheel-turning monarch' ('; '), the king who rules righteously and non-violently according to Dharma. His roles and duties are discussed extensively in Buddhist texts. The \"Cakkavatti\" is a moral example to the people and possesses enough spiritual merit. It is through this that he earns his sovereignty, as opposed to merely inheriting it. Also, the Buddha himself was born as a prince, and was also a king (Vessantara) in a previous life. Apart from the models in the \"suttas\", Pāli chronicles such as the Mahāvaṃsa and the Jinakālamālī may have contributed to the ideals of Buddhist kingship. In these vernacular Pāli works, examples are given of royalty performing meritorious acts, sometimes as a form of repentance for previously committed wrongdoings. The emperor Asoka () is featured as an important patron supporting the Sangha.\n\nBecause of these traditions, kings have had an important role in maintaining the Sangha, and publicly performed grand acts of merit, as is testified by epigraphic evidence from South and South-East Asia. In Sri Lanka, from the tenth century CE onward, kings have assumed the role of a lay protector of the Sangha, and so have Thai kings, during the periods of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya (fourteenth until eighteenth centuries). In fact, a number of kings in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma have described themselves as \"Bodhisattas\", and epithets and royal language were established accordingly. In short, kingship in traditional Buddhist societies was connected with the Sangha as a field of merit: the king assumed an exemplary role as a donor to the Sangha, and the Sangha legitimated the king as a leader of the state. Both facilitated one another, and both needed each other. In times of famine or other hardship, it was traditionally believed that the king was failing, and the king would typically perform meritorious activities on a grand scale. In this way the king would be able to improve the kingdom's conditions, through his \"overflow karma\" (Walters). A similar role was played by queens.\n\nIn the last seven centuries in Thailand, the Vessantara Jātaka has played a significant role in legitimating kingship in Thailand, through a yearly festival known as the 'Preaching of the Great Life' (). Merit-making and \"pāramīs\" (doing good deeds, developing good habits to become a Buddha) were greatly emphasized in this festival, through the story about Prince Vessantara's generosity. During the reform period of Rama IV, as Thai Buddhism was being modernized, the festival was dismissed as not reflecting true Buddhism. Its popularity has greatly diminished ever since. Nevertheless, the use of merit-making by the Thai monarchy and government, to solidify their position and create unity in society, has continued until the late twentieth century.\n\nBuddhists are not in agreement with regard to the interpretation, role, and importance of merit. The role of merit-making in Buddhism has been discussed throughout Buddhist history, but much more so in the last centuries. In the nineteenth century, during the rise of Buddhist modernism and the Communist regimes, Buddhists in South and Southeast Asia became more critical about merit-making when it became associated with magical practices, privileging, ritualism and waste of resources. In pre-modern Thailand, a great deal of the funds of temples were derived from the profits of land that were offered to temples by royalty and nobility. During the period of religious reform and administrative centralization in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Thai temples were no longer supported in this manner and had to find other ways to maintain themselves.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, perspectives of merit-making had changed again, as merit-making was being associated with capitalism and consumerism, which had been rising in South and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, in some Buddhist countries, such as Thailand, there is a tendency among teachers and practitioners to dismiss and even revile merit-making in favor of teachings about detachment and attaining Nirvana, for which L. S. Cousins has coined the term \"\".\n\nStudies done in the 1960s and 1970s in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Burma showed that a great deal of time, effort and money was invested by people in merit-making, e.g. Spiro described Burma's rural economy as \"geared to the overriding goal of the accumulation of wealth as a means of acquiring merit\". In some studies done in rural Burma, up to thirty percent of people's income was spent on merit-making. In 2014, when Burma ranked highest on the World Giving Index (tied with the United States, and followed by many other Buddhist countries), scholars attributed this to the Burmese habit of merit-making. Studies done in Thailand, however, showed that in the 1980s merit-making was declining, and a significant group did no longer believe in karma—though this was not a majority. Some scholars disagree with these findings, however, saying that Buddhist practices such as merit-making are still very widespread. Similar observations have been made about Cambodia and even about Thai people in the United States. As for Buddhist \"converts\" in the west, for example from the United Kingdom, the interest in merit is less than among Asian Buddhists, but they strongly appreciate the generosity and reverence as exhibited by Asian Buddhists.\n\nSome scholars have suggested that merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries in a negative way, because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple. It has also been suggested that even if the economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy that the majority of the population would not prefer. Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely. Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen social ties, which Walters calls \"sociokarma\".\n\nScholars have often connected the notion of karma to the determinism in the caste system in India. Just like in the case of karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate. Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, as in the case of someone ordaining as a monk for a few years. And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out. Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making. Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.\n\nThe idea of merit is also at the basis of the movements as has been studied in Thailand and other Buddhist societies. \"Phu Mi Bun\" are people who are considered to have much merit from past lives, whose influence morally affects society at large. \"Phu Mi Bun\" are in many ways similar to people declared \"Bodhisattvas\" in Buddhist societies, and in fact, the word \"Phu Mi Bun\" is often used in traditional Thai texts about the previous lives of the Buddha. Besides the example of the king himself, certain monks and \"shamans\" have assumed this role throughout history. In Thailand, around the turn of the twentieth century, a millennialist movement arose regarding the coming of a \"Phu Mi Bun\", to the extent of becoming an insurgency which was suppressed by the government. This insurgency became known to Thai historians as the \"rebellion of the \"Phu Mi Bun\"\" (), commonly known in English as the Holy Man's Rebellion. Several of such rebellions involving \"Phu Mi Bun\" have taken place in the history of Thai, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. For example, in Cambodia, there were \"Phu Mi Bun\"–led revolts against the French control of Cambodia. Lucien Hanks has shown that beliefs pertaining to \"Phu Mi Bun\" have profoundly affected the way Thai people relate to authority. Indologist Arthur Basham, however, believed that in contemporary Thai society the \"Phu Mi Bun\" is more of a label, and \"merit\" more of a secular term than a deeply-rooted belief.\n\nOne merit-making practice that has received more scholarly attention since the 1990s is the practice of \"merit release\". Merit release is a ritual of releasing animals from captivity, as a way to make merit. Merit release is a practice common in many Buddhist societies, and has since the 2010s made a comeback in some societies. Its origins are unclear, but traditionally it is said to originate from the Mahāyāna \"Humane King Sutra\", among other sources. It often involves a large number of animals which are released simultaneously, as well as chanting, making a resolution, and transfer of merits. Though the most common practice is the releasing of fish and birds back in nature, there are also other forms: in Tibet, animals are bought from the slaughterhouse to release. However, the practice has come under criticism by wildlife conservationists and scholars. Studies done in Cambodia, Hong Kong and Taiwan have shown that the practice may not only be fatal for a high percentage of the released animals, but may also affect the survival of threatened species, create a black market for wildlife, as well as pose a threat for public hygiene. Some Buddhist organizations have responded to this by adjusting their practices, by working together with conservationist organizations to educate people, and even by pushing for new laws controlling the practice. , the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) started discussing possible solutions with religious communities on how the practice could be adapted. According to the SCB, the communities have generally responded positively. In the meantime, in some countries, laws have been issued to control the practice. In Singapore, to limit merit release on Vesak celebrations, people were fined.\n\nDespite its critics, merit release continues to grow, and has also developed new forms in western countries. In 2016, it was widely reported that the Canada-based Great Enlightenment Buddhist Institute Society (GEBIS) had released of lobsters in the ocean. The release was planned in agreement with local lobster-men. In the same year, Wendy Cook from Lincoln, United States, bought fourteen rabbits from a farm to raise them under better conditions. The costly release, advertised on Facebook as \"The Great Rabbit Liberation of 2016\", was supported by Buddhist monastics from Singapore and the Tibetan tradition, and was based on the idea of merit-making.

As a matter of ritual, Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with \"Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ\", seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute should be carried beyond this time. The importance of forgiveness in Jainism may be compared to the importance of forgiveness in other religions.\n\nThe phrase is also used by Jains throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones. \n\nAt the end of the festival Paryushana, devotees request forgiveness for any offenses committed during the year by saying ‘Micchami Dukkadam’ or ‘Uttam Kshama’ meaning “If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness.” \n\n\"micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ\" is most commonly used on the last day (\"Samvatsari\") of one of the most holy annual Jain events, Paryushana. After \"pratikramana\" (Jain prayer, literally meaning \"introspection\"), Jains seek forgiveness from almost all the creatures of the world whom they may have harmed knowingly or unknowingly by uttering the phrase—\"micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ\".\n\nParyushana frequently falls in August or September during Cāturmāsa, four months into the rainy season. This annual holy time for Jains is reserved for prayers, meditation, introspection, penance, and fasting. Even the wandering monks temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst laymen, giving discourses and organizing scriptural recitations.\n\nTraditionally, letters were sent and telephone calls made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.\n\nThe phrase \"michchāmi dukkaḍaṃ\" is also found in the \"Airyapathiki Sutra\". It literally means — may all the evil that has been done be fruitless, and comes from the Prakrit language, a middle Indo-Aryan language, closely linked with Pali and used abundantly in the Prakrit canon of Jainism. <br>\nThe Sanskrit version\"(chayā)\" of the phrase is \"mithyā me duṣkṛitām\" meaning \"may the evil of it be in vain\". or simply put \"May my misdeeds be undone.\"<br>\n\"mithyā\" refers to 'being fruitless' or 'getting absolved of'. \"me\" refers to 'my'. \"duṣkṛitām\" refers to 'bad deeds'.\n\n"}

{"id": "52242050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52242050", "title": "Multiplicative weight update method", "text": "Multiplicative weight update method\n\nThe multiplicative weights update method is an algorithmic technique most commonly used for decision making and prediction, and also widely deployed in game theory and algorithm design. The simplest use case is the problem of prediction from expert advice, in which a decision maker needs to iteratively decide on an expert whose advice to follow. The method assigns initial weights to the experts (usually identical initial weights), and updates these weights multiplicatively and iteratively according to the feedback of how well an expert performed: reducing it in case of poor performance, and increasing it otherwise. It was discovered repeatedly in very diverse fields such as machine learning (AdaBoost, Winnow, Hedge), optimization (solving linear programs), theoretical computer science (devising fast algorithm for LPs and SDPs), and game theory.\n\n\"Multiplicative weights\" implies the iterative rule used in algorithms derived from the multiplicative weight update method. It is given with different names in the different fields where it was discovered or rediscovered.\n\nThe earliest known version of this technique was in an algorithm named \"fictitious play\" which was proposed in game theory in the early 1950s. Grigoriadis and Khachiyan applied a randomized variant of \"fictitious play\" to solve two-player zero-sum games efficiently using the multiplicative weights algorithm. In this case, player allocates higher weight to the actions that had a better outcome and choose his strategy relying on these weights. In machine learning, Littlestone applied the earliest form of the multiplicative weights update rule in his famous winnow algorithm, which is similar to Minsky and Papert's earlier perceptron learning algorithm. Later, he generalized the winnow algorithm to weighted majority algorithm. Freund and Schapire followed his steps and generalized the winnow algorithm in the form of hedge algorithm.\n\nThe multiplicative weights algorithm is also widely applied in computational geometry such as Clarkson's algorithm for linear programming (LP) with a bounded number of variables in linear time. Later, Bronnimann and Goodrich employed analogous methods to find set covers for hypergraphs with small VC dimension.\n\nIn operation research and on-line statistical decision making problem field, the weighted majority algorithm and its more complicated versions have been found independently.\n\nIn computer science field, some researchers have previously observed the close relationships between multiplicative update algorithms used in different contexts. Young discovered the similarities between fast LP algorithms and Raghavan's method of pessimistic estimators for derandomization of randomized rounding algorithms; Klivans and Servedio linked boosting algorithms in learning theory to proofs of Yao's XOR Lemma; Garg and Khandekar defined a common framework for convex optimization problems that contains Garg-Konemann and Plotkin-Shmoys-Tardos as subcases.\n\nA binary decision needs to be made based on n experts’ opinions to attain an associated payoff. In the first round, all experts’ opinions have the same weight. The decision maker will make the first decision based on the majority of the experts' prediction. Then, in each successive round, the decision maker will repeatedly update the weight of each expert's opinion depending on the correctness of his prior predictions. Real life examples includes predicting if it is rainy tomorrow or if the stock market will go up or go down.\n\nGiven a sequential game played between an adversary and an aggregator who is advised by N experts, the goal is for the aggregator to make as few mistakes as possible. Assume there is an expert among the N experts who always gives the correct prediction. In the halving algorithm, only the consistent experts are retained. Experts who make mistakes will be dismissed. For every decision, the aggregator decides by taking a majority vote among the remaining experts. Therefore, every time the aggregator makes a mistake, at least half of the remaining experts are dismissed. The aggregator makes at most mistakes.\n\nUnlike halving algorithm which dismisses experts who have made mistakes, weighted majority algorithm discounts their advice. Given the same \"expert advice\" setup, suppose we have n decisions, and we need to select one decision for each loop. In each loop, every decision incurs a cost. All costs will be revealed after making the choice. The cost is 0 if the expert is correct, and 1 otherwise. this algorithm's goal is to limit its cumulative losses to roughly the same as the best of experts.\nThe very first algorithm that makes choice based on majority vote every iteration does not work since the majority of the experts can be wrong consistently every time. The weighted majority algorithm corrects above trivial algorithm by keeping a weight of experts instead of fixing the cost at either 1 or 0. This would make fewer mistakes compared to halving algorithm.\n\nIf formula_10, the weight of the expert's advice will remain the same. When formula_11 increases, the weight of the expert's advice will decrease. Note that some researchers fix formula_12 in weighted majority algorithm.\n\nAfter formula_6 steps, let formula_14 be the number of mistakes of expert i and formula_15 be the number of mistakes our algorithm has made. Then we have the following bound for every formula_16:\n\nIn particular, this holds for i which is the best expert. Since the best expert will have the least formula_14, it will give the best bound on the number of mistakes made by the algorithm as a whole.\n\nGiven the same setup with N experts. Consider the special situation where the proportions of experts predicting positive and negative, counting the weights, are both close to 50%. Then, there might be a tie. Following the weight update rule in weighted majority algorithm, the predictions made by the algorithm would be randomized. The algorithm calculates the probabilities of experts predicting positive or negatives, and then makes a random decision based on the computed fraction:\n\npredict \n\nwhere \n\nThe number of mistakes made by the randomized weighted majority algorithm is bounded as: \n\nwhere formula_22 and formula_23.\n\nNote that only the learning algorithm is randomized. The underlying assumption is that the examples and experts' predictions are not random. The only randomness is the randomness where the learner makes his own prediction.\nIn this randomized algorithm, formula_24 if formula_25. Compared to weighted algorithm, this randomness halved the number of mistakes the algorithm is going to make. However, it is important to note that in some research, people define formula_12 in weighted majority algorithm and allow formula_27 in randomized weighted majority algorithm.\n\nThe multiplicative weights method is usually used to solve a constrained optimization problem. Let each expert be the constraint in the problem, and the events represent the points in the area of interest. The punishment of the expert corresponds to how well its corresponding constraint is satisfied on the point represented by an event.\n\nSuppose we were given the distribution formula_28 on experts. Let formula_29 = payoff matrix of a finite two-player zero-sum game, with formula_30 rows.\n\nWhen the row player formula_31 uses plan formula_16 and the column player formula_33 uses plan formula_34, the payoff of player formula_33 is formula_36≔formula_37, assuming formula_38.\n\nIf player formula_31 chooses action formula_16 from a distribution formula_28 over the rows, then the expected result for player formula_33 selecting action formula_34 is formula_44.\n\nTo maximize formula_45, player formula_33 is should choose plan formula_34. Similarly, the expected payoff for player formula_48 is formula_49. Choosing plan formula_16 would minimize this payoff. By John Von Neumann's Min-Max Theorem, we obtain:\n\nwhere P and i changes over the distributions over rows, Q and j changes over the columns.\n\nThen, let formula_52 denote the common value of above quantities, also named as the \"value of the game\". Let formula_53 be an error parameter. To solve the zero-sum game bounded by additive error of formula_54,\n\nSo there is an algorithm solving zero-sum game up to an additive factor of δ using O(/formula_57) calls to ORACLE, with an additional processing time of O(n) per call\n\nIn machine learning, Littlestone and Warmuth generalized the winnow algorithm to the weighted majority algorithm. Later, Freund and Schapire generalized it in the form of hedge algorithm. AdaBoost Algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire also employed the Multiplicative Weight Update Method.\n\nBased on current knowledge in algorithms, multiplicative weight update method was first used in Littlestone's winnow algorithm. It is used in machine learning to solve a linear program.\n\nGiven formula_58 labeled examples formula_59 where formula_60 are feature vectors, and formula_61 are their labels.\n\nThe aim is to find non-negative weights such that for all examples, the sign of the weighted combination of the features matches its labels. That is, require that formula_62 for all formula_34. Without loss of generality, assume the total weight is 1 so that they form a distribution. Thus, for notational convenience, redefine formula_64 to be formula_65, the problem reduces to finding a solution to the following LP:\n\nThis is general form of LP.\n\nThe hedge algorithm is similar to the weighted majority algorithm. However, their exponential update rules are different.\nIt is generally used to solve the problem of binary allocation in which we need to allocate different portion of resources into N different options. The loss with every option is available at the end of every iteration. The goal is to reduce the total loss suffered for a particular allocation. The allocation for the following iteration is then revised, based on the total loss suffered in the current iteration using multiplicative update.\n\nAssume the learning rate formula_69 and for formula_70, formula_71 is picked by Hedge. Then for all experts formula_16,\n\nInitialization: Fix an formula_69. For each expert, associate the weight formula_75 ≔1\nFor t=1,2,…,T:\n\nThis algorithm maintains a set of weights formula_80 over the training examples. On every iteration formula_3, a distribution formula_71 is computed by normalizing these weights. This distribution is fed to the weak learner WeakLearn which generates a hypothesis formula_83 that (hopefully) has small error with respect to the distribution. Using the new hypothesis formula_83, AdaBoost generates the next weight vector formula_85. The process repeats. After T such iterations, the final hypothesis formula_86 is the output. The hypothesis formula_86 combines the outputs of the T weak hypotheses using a weighted majority vote.\n\nGiven a formula_109 matrix formula_29 and formula_111, is there a formula_112 such that formula_113?\n\nUsing the oracle algorithm in solving zero-sum problem, with an error parameter formula_115, the output would either be a point formula_112 such that formula_117 or a proof that formula_112 does not exist, i.e., there is no solution to this linear system of inequalities.\n\nGiven vector formula_119, solves the following relaxed problem\n\nIf there exists a x satisfying (1), then x satisfies (2) for all formula_121. The contrapositive of this statement is also true.\nSuppose if oracle returns a feasible solution for a formula_122, the solution formula_112 it returns has bounded width formula_124.\nSo if there is a solution to (1), then there is an algorithm that its output x satisfies the system (2) up to an additive error of formula_125. The algorithm makes at most formula_126 calls to a width-bounded oracle for the problem (2). The contrapositive stands true as well. The multiplicative updates is applied in the algorithm in this case.\n\nIn operations research and on-line statistical decision making problem field, the weighted majority algorithm and its more complicated versions have been found independently.\n\nThe multiplicative weights algorithm is also widely applied in computational geometry, such as Clarkson's algorithm for linear programming (LP) with a bounded number of variables in linear time.

Podlesny, 92 F.3d 446 (7th Cir. 1996) was a case heard in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit regarding the protection of a school student in Ashland, Wisconsin, who had been harassed and bullied by classmates because of his sexual orientation. The plaintiff in the case—Jamie Nabozny—sought damages from school officials for their failure to protect him from the bullying. A jury found that this failure violated Nabozny's constitutional rights and awarded him $962,000 in damages.\n\nJamie Nabozny (born October 1975) went to the local public middle school in the small Wisconsin town of Ashland, where his parents Bob and Carol Nabozny had grown up. His parents had a rocky relationship, which wasn't helped by poverty. In spite of this, he managed to do well in school. Bullies at Nabozny's school believed him to be effeminate and \"girlish\" and bullied him. The harassment reached a point where at age 13, Nabozny complained to his parents who decided to send him to live with an uncle and aunt temporarily who would homeschool him. Nabozny's aunt consoled him for the bullying and he shared with her the secret that he was gay but this disclosure did not fit with her religious beliefs. Nabozny ran away, and his aunt informed the police who investigated his running away and in the course of their investigation disclosed Nabozny's sexuality to his parents. His mother Carol was supportive and loving, but his father Bob reacted in anger, storming out of the room after telling Jamie that it was simply a phase.\n\nNabozny's return to middle school led to the harassment recommencing. He told a school counselor that he had been called a \"queer\", a \"faggot\" and a \"fudge packer\" among other terms and confirmed to the counselor that he was indeed gay and did not wish to deny this. The counselor attempted to intervene and get the bullies to stop but it resumed shortly after the intervention. A new counselor arrived at the school who also attempted to make the bullying stop by involving the school principal, Mary Podlesny. Despite the intervention of the principal, the abuse soon resumed and now started including physical violence—hits, kicks and elbows.\n\nIn addition to Nabozny's sexual orientation, another fact led into his bullying. At age 11, Jamie Nabozny was molested by an 18-year-old church youth group leader named Nick Rising. He kept this abuse secret until Rising attempted to molest Jamie's younger brother. Rising was arrested, pleaded guilty at trial and went to jail. The scandal was reported in a local newspaper. A number of the bullies who were harassing Nabozny were friendly with Rising and blamed Nabozny for reporting the sexual assaults.\n\nNabozny's parents complained repeatedly about the bullying but after no action was taken by the principal, they pulled Jamie out of school and transferred him to a Catholic middle school to finish seventh grade. The cost of the tuition fees meant that he dropped out shortly after starting eighth grade. Jamie Nabozny had to return to the middle school where he endured more harassment, homophobic language and physical violence. In one incident, Jamie and his brother Corey were physically assaulted by a group of boys in the bathrooms.\n\nFollowing this harassment, Bob and Carol Nabozny complained again to the school and demanded a meeting with the Principal. At the meeting with the Nabozny family and a number of the boys who Jamie had accused of bullying, the Principal took the word of the bullies and then also later told Jamie Nabozny that if he continued to be out about his sexual orientation at school, the bullying would continue. The bullies faced no disciplinary actions and the harassment continued. Following a number of bullies verbally abusing him, inappropriately touching him and then enacting a mock rape while the rest of his class watched, Nabozny went to the principal who told him that \"boys will be boys\" and admonished him for entering her office without an appointment. The continued bullying at middle school led to Nabozny attempting suicide, after which he refused to return to middle school.\n\nAt high school, the same bullies returned and the harassment continued. At one point, Nabozny was attacked while at a urinal and urinated upon by another boy. William Davis, the principal at the high school continued the inaction—the perpetrators were not disciplined and the only advice Davis gave to Nabozny was to go home to change his clothes. He attempted suicide for a second time.\n\nNabozny's parents attempted to send him to live with an aunt and uncle in Drummond, Wisconsin, but his uncle was hostile to his homosexuality, leading him to run away from them and hitch-hike to Minneapolis. Bob and Carol Nabozny attempted to find him in Minneapolis and distributed 'missing child' posters. Nabozny phoned the number listed on one of the posters and was reunited with his parents. Nabozny told his parents that he refused to return to the high school. They sought to homeschool him but were legally forbidden as neither had a high school diploma. They could not afford to send him to a private school, and the only private school nearby was a Christian fundamentalist school. The school district demanded that Jamie return to high school, where the bullying started again.\n\nNabozny's parents requested the local social services department put him into foster care out of the district so he could attend school elsewhere. At the new school, the bullying that Nabozny suffered was promptly resolved by the school. The new school seemed to boost his happiness and self-confidence as well as his grades. The social worker who had moved Nabozny demanded that he move back to his parents during tenth grade. He then had to return to the high school in Ashland, where the bullying restarted. The school continued to ignore the bullying and assistant principal Thomas Blaumert told Nabozny that his harassment was due to him provoking them and that he deserved the punishment because of his sexuality. Blaumert also laughed when Nabozny was pushed and tripped in the hallway.\n\nFor over four years, no school official took any disciplinary action in response to Nabozny's reports. In the eleventh grade, he was attacked in the school library by a group of boys, one of whom repeatedly kicked him in the stomach which caused him to have pain and a stomach cramp for weeks. The internal bleeding and bruising required surgery.\n\nIn December 1992, Nabozny collected together over $100 in cash and ran away from Ashland and took a bus to Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, he moved in with a gay church deacon and his partner who served as foster parents. He was diagnosed with depression and post traumatic stress disorder and spent years in therapy. Eventually, he completed his GED and became a student at the University of Minnesota and studied for a degree in psychology.\n\nNabozny decided to sue the school district and was represented by Lambda Legal, an LGBT legal organisation. They had made a policy decision in 1995 to take cases involving youth issues. Nabozny was represented by Patricia Logue, a lawyer (and lesbian) who had previously worked in corporate law before taking a job with Lambda in Chicago in 1993 along with Michael Terrien an attorney with Skadden Arps Meagher and Flom LLP. She had previously helped a black LGBT group change the policy of the Bud Billiken Parade in Chicago.\n\nThe case was brought against the school district as well as a number of the school officials. Nabozny's lawyers argued that his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection and due process had been violated by the school's failure to protect him as a member of a discernible minority group, namely gay people. They also argued that his rights under Wisconsin law to not be discriminated against were violated by the school district. The plaintiffs also pointed to the existence of school anti-harassment policies and argued that they were being enforced in a discriminatory manner: when sexist abuse was reported by female students, it was quickly stopped by school officials in a way they did not do for homophobic bullying.\n\nThe District Court made a summary judgment in favor of the school district. Nabozny appealed to the Seventh Circuit federal appeals court which found that the school district had infringed his equal protection rights on the grounds of combined gender and sexual orientation discrimination, but rejected the due process claim.\n\nJudge Jesse E. Eschbach concluded in his judgment:\n\nCatherine A. Lugg, a professor of education at Rutgers University, said that the facts of the case \"clearly illustrates the public school's historic power as the \"enforcer\" of expected norms regarding gender, heteronormativity and homophobia\" and also shows \"how devastating a homophobic public school culture can be for queer children\".\n\nIn 1997, the Department of Education clarified that Title IX requires schools to provide students with an environment free of harassment and that this requirement includes gay and lesbian students.\n\nSince the \"Nabozny\" case, other students who have brought similar cases have generally won. Such cases include:\n\n"}
{"id": "16963753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16963753", "title": "Need for affiliation", "text": "Need for affiliation\n\nThe need for affiliation (N-Affil) is a term that was popularized by David McClelland and describes a person's need to feel a sense of involvement and \"belonging\" within a social group; McClellend's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of Henry Murray who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including achievement, power and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. People with a high need for affiliation require warm interpersonal relationships and approval from those with whom they have regular contact. Having a strong bond with others make a person feel as if they are a part of something important that creates a powerful impact. People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members, but may be less effective in leadership positions. A person who takes part in a group, whether it be a movement or project, create a push towards a sense of achievement and satisfaction for the individual and the whole. \n\nAffiliation is a positive, sometimes intimate, personal relationship. Affiliation can include \"concern over establishing, maintaining, or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons\".\n\nThere are many situations in which people feel a need for affiliation. For example, in a business setting, when creating a new product there can be many different ideas on how to market the product. A recently hired employee might feel a need for affiliation to have their idea heard because they feel this is the best course of action. If that person's idea is a success then that individual will feel a sense of achievement. Thus, being new the employee, he decides to involve himself so he feels a sense of belonging to the rest of the employees. One situation that causes a greater need for affiliation is during a stressful situation. An example where there was an increase in the need for affiliation among individuals was right after the September 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. This event led to Americans' putting their differences aside and coming together. The increase in an individual's need for affiliation allowed individuals responding to the same stressor to come together and find security in one another. Situations that include fear often lead people to want to be together and trigger a need for affiliation. Research done by Schachter (1959) shows that fear that comes from anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going through the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event. The strength of this need changes from one person to the next, there are moments that people just want to be together.\n\nThe need for affiliation for an individual can vary over short amounts of time; there are times when individuals wish to be with others and other times to be alone. In one study, completed by Shawn O'Connor and Lorne Rosenblood, beepers were distributed to the students. The students were then asked to record, when their beepers went off, whether or not they wanted to be alone or if they wanted to be with others at that particular moment. This study was done to observe how frequently college students were in the presence of others and how frequently they were alone. The next step in this study asked for the students to record whether, at the time their beeper went off, they wanted to be alone or in the company of others. This response that they gave usually reflected which of the two situations they were experiencing the next time their beepers went off. The information retained from this study helped to show the strength of an individual's need for affiliation. By showing how frequently they obtained the presence of others when they felt that it was what they wanted at that moment it showed how strong their need for affiliation was at that particular moment. \n\nDepending on the specific circumstances, an individual's level of need for affiliation can become increased or decreased. Yacov Rofe suggested that the need for affiliation depended on whether being with others would be useful for the situation or not. When the presence of other people was seen as being helpful in relieving an individual from some of the negative aspects of the stressor, an individual's desire to affiliate increases. However, if being with others may increase the negative aspects such as adding the possibility of embarrassment to the already present stressor, the individual's desire to affiliate with others decreases. Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions. Each individual desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others.\n\n"}

Hering took influence from the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics and suggested that memories could be passed on through generations by germ cells.\n\nVariants of the organic memory theory were proposed by advocates of Lamarckian evolution such as Samuel Butler, Ernst Haeckel, Eugenio Rignano, Théodule-Armand Ribot and Richard Semon.

Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as mass panic (closely related to herd behavior).\n\nThe word derives from antiquity and is a tribute to the ancient god, Pan. One of the many gods in the mythology of ancient Greece: Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan's nature Greek authors derived the word panikon, “sudden fear,” the ultimate source of the English word: \"panic\".\n\nPrehistoric humans used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially ruminants. Herds reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards cliffs, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered. Humans are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person's panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts irrationally, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others' panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills). Architects and city planners try to accommodate the symptoms of panic, such as herd behavior, during design and planning, often using simulations to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion (stampedes). The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column or columns, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point.\n\nLeonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner describe panic as “that terrible, profound emotion that stretches us beyond our ability to imagine any experience more horrible” adding that “physicians like to compare painful clinical conditions on some imagined ‘Richter scale’ of vicious, mean hurt … to the psychiatrist there is no more vicious, mean hurt than an exploding and personally disintegrating panic attack.”\n\nAn influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in Neil J. Smelser's \"Theory of Collective Behavior\". The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.\n\nMany highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of Mecca was extensively redesigned by Saudi authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent stampedes, which kill an average of 250 pilgrims every year. Football stadiums have seen deadly crowd rushes and stampedes, such as at Heysel stadium in Belgium in 1985 with more than 600 casualties, including 39 deaths, and at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, England, in 1989 when 96 people were killed in a deadly crush.\n\n"}
{"id": "23266996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23266996", "title": "Patriarchy", "text": "Patriarchy\n\nPatriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.\n\nPatriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal ideology that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that gender roles in a society affect power differentials between men and women.\n\nHistorically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures. Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.\n\n\"Patriarchy\" literally means \"the rule of the father\" and comes from the Greek πατριάρχης (\"patriarkhēs\"), \"father of a race\" or \"chief of a race, patriarch\", which is a compound of πατριά (\"patria\"), \"lineage, descent\" (from πατήρ \"patēr\", \"father\") and ἄρχω (\"arkhō\"), \"I rule\".\n\nHistorically, the term \"patriarchy\" was used to refer to autocratic rule by the male head of a family. However, since the late 20th century it has more often been used to refer to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men, particularly by writers associated with second-wave feminism such as Kate Millett; these writers sought to use an understanding of patriarchal social relations to liberate women from male domination. This concept of patriarchy was developed to explain male dominance as a social, rather than biological, phenomenon.\n\nThe sociologist Sylvia Walby defines patriarchy as \"a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress, and exploit women\". Social stratification along gender lines, in which power is predominantly held by men, has been observed in most societies.\n\nAnthropological, archaeological, and evolutionary psychological evidence suggests that most prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies were relatively egalitarian, and that patriarchal social structures did not develop until many years after the end of the Pleistocene era, following social and technological developments such as agriculture and domestication. According to Robert M. Strozier, historical research has not yet found a specific \"initiating event\". Gerda Lerner asserts that there was no single event, and documents that patriarchy as a social system arose in different parts of the world at different times. Some scholars point to about six thousand years ago (4000 BCE), when the concept of fatherhood took root, as the beginning of the spread of patriarchy.\n\nMarxist theory, as articulated mainly by Friedrich Engels, assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of private property, which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children. Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.\n\nDomination by men of women is found in the Ancient Near East as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from \"the process of representing or the construction of history\". According to some researchers, with the appearance of the Hebrews, there is also \"the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant\".\n\nThe archaeologist Marija Gimbutas argues that waves of kurgan-building invaders from the Ukrainian steppes into the early agricultural cultures of Old Europe in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in Western society. Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.\n\nA prominent Greek general Meno, in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in Classical Greece about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:\nThe works of Aristotle portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.\n\nGerda Lerner, author of \"The Creation of Patriarchy,\" states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that \"soul contributes the form and model of creation\". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.\n\nEgypt left no philosophical record, but Herodotus left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in trade. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local tribunal, engage in real estate transactions, and inherit or bequeath property. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.\n\nGreek influence spread, however, with the conquests of Alexander the Great, who was educated by Aristotle.\n\nDuring this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism. Adopted as the official religion in the Han dynasty, Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior. \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues\", a Confucian text, places a woman's value on her loyalty and obedience. It explains that an obedient woman is to obey their father before her marriage, her husband after marriage, and her first son if widowed, and that a virtuous woman must practice sexual propriety, proper speech, modest appearance, and hard work. Ban Zhao, a Confucian disciple, writes in her book \"Precepts for Women\", that a woman's primary concern is to subordinate themselves before patriarchal figures such as a husband or father, and that they need not concern themselves with intelligence or talent. Ban Zhao is considered by some historians as an early champion for women's education in China, however her extensive writing on the value of a woman's mediocrity and servile behavior leaves others feeling that this narrative is the result of a misplaced desire to cast her in a contemporary feminist light. Similarly to \"Three Obediences and Four Virtues\", \"Precepts for Women\" was meant as a moral guide for proper feminine behavior, and was widely accepted as such for centuries.\n\nIn China's Ming Dynasty, widowed women were expected to never re-marry, and unmarried women were expected to remain chaste for the duration of their lives. Biographies of Exemplary Women, a book containing biographies of women who lived according to the Confucian ideals of virtuous womanhood, popularized an entire genre of similar writing during the Ming dynasty. Women who lived according to this Neo-Confucian ideal were celebrated in official documents, and some had structures erected in their honor.\n\nAlthough many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir Robert Filmer. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled \"Patriarcha\". However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from Adam, the first man of the human species, according to Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nHowever, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – Diderot's Encyclopedia denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, \"... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...\"\n\nIn the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was Sarah Grimké, who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published \"The Woman's Bible\", which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition. In his essay, \"A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century\", Michael Grossberg coined the phrase \"judicial patriarchy\" stating that, \"The judge became the buffer between the family and the state.\" and that, \"Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.\n\nIn China's Qing Dynasty, laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, \"rendering [women] unmarriageable,\" a stigma which did not follow men. Similarly, in the People's Republic of China, laws governing morality which were written as egalitarian were selectively enforced favoring men, permissively allowing female infanticide, while infanticide of any form was, by the letter of the law, prohibited.\nIn the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in institutionalized control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.\n\nFeminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. Shulamith Firestone, a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression. Feminist historian Gerda Lerner believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy. Alison Jaggar also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.\n\nInteractive systems theorists Iris Marion Young and Heidi Hartmann believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other socialist and Marxist feminists use the terms \"patriarchal capitalism\" or \"capitalist patriarchy\" to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women. According to Hartmann, the term \"patriarchy\" redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle..\n\nAudre Lorde, an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that racism and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression. Sara Ruddick, a philosopher who wrote about \"good mothers\" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a \"good mother,\" she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?\n\nGerda Lerner, in her 1986 \"The Creation of Patriarchy\", makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.\n\nSome feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women. It often includes any social, political, or economic mechanism that evokes male dominance over women. Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.\n\nJaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the heteropatriarchal family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.\n\nMany feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to culture change. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society. Prior to the widespread use of the term \"patriarchy\", early feminists used \"male chauvinism\" and \"sexism\" to refer roughly to the same phenomenon. Author bell hooks argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.\n\nSociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where \"women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”\n\nAnne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.\n\nAs a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems. Hormones have been declared as the \"key to the sexual universe\" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual. Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the \"male-hormone\" and \"female-hormone\" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.\n\nSociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing gender roles. According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation. These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development. Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.\n\nBiologist Richard Lewontin asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of gender feminism, such as Christina Hoff Sommers, have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.\n\nThis is called biological determinism, which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male testosterone hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.\n\nA hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, \"the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological.\" Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent \"sexual division\".\n\nAlthough patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, \"the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short\", during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by \"how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity\".\n\nFeminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them. For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation. These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.\n\nA growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average. However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.\n\nFurthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains. Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men. Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which \"men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers.\"\n\nWithin the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a \"relationship between intelligence and brain size\". However, there is \"no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'\", yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.\n\nSociologist Sylvia Walby has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:\n\nSome sociobiologists, such as Steven Goldberg, argue that social behavior is primarily determined by genetics, and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, \"The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all.\" Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the \"feelings of both men and women\", Eleanor Leacock countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are \"sparse and contradictory\", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are \"ambiguous\". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.\n\nAn early theory in evolutionary psychology offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most species females are a limiting factor over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as Bateman's principle. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an evolutionary pressure on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power. \n\nHowever, an alternative evolutionary theory has challenged this theory. Attachment Fertility Theory, based on attachment theory, observes that human infants are born with a level of helplessness unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom and that father involvement is critical to human infant survival. Because the investment in offspring required by human males and females is nearly equal, they are proposed to have evolved sex-similar mating preferences (Mutual Mate Choice), that is, both men and women prefer caring, attractive, and successful partners.\n\nThe idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy. Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.\n\nThere is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" states, \"The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed.\" The masculinities scholar David Buchbinder suggests that Roland Barthes' description of the term \"ex-nomination\" (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, \"[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power.\"\n\nAmong the Mosuo (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making. Other societies are matrilinear or matrilocal, primarily among indigenous tribal groups. Some hunter-gatherer groups have been characterized as largely egalitarian. Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a cultural universal.\nBarbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:\n\nWhile the term \"patriarchy\" often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally \"rule of the father\". So some people believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.\n\nThis psychoanalytic model is based upon revisions of Freud's description of the normally neurotic family using the analogy of the story of Oedipus. Those who fall outside the Oedipal triad of mother/father/child are less subject to male authority. \n\nThe operations of power in such cases are usually enacted unconsciously. All are subject, even fathers are bound by its strictures. It is represented in unspoken traditions and conventions performed in everyday behaviors, customs, and habits. The triangular relationship of a father, a mother and an inheriting eldest son frequently form the dynamic and emotional narratives of popular culture and are enacted performatively in rituals of courtship and marriage. They provide conceptual models for organising power relations in spheres that have nothing to do with the family, for example, politics and business.\n\nArguing from this standpoint, radical feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote in her 1970 \"The Dialectic of Sex\":\n\nMarx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It indicates the group of topological invariant for topological insulators and superconductors in each dimension and in each discrete symmetry class.\n\nThere are ten discrete symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors, corresponding to the ten Altland–Zirnbauer classes of random matrices. They are defined by three symmetries of the Hamiltonian formula_1, (where formula_2, and formula_3, are the annihilation and creation operators of mode formula_4, in some arbitrary spatial basis) : time reversal symmetry, particle hole (or charge conjugation) symmetry, and chiral (or sublattice) symmetry.\n\nChiral symmetry is a unitary operator formula_5, that acts on formula_2, as a unitary rotation (formula_7,) and satisfies formula_8. A Hamiltonian formula_9 possesses chiral symmetry when formula_10, for some choice of formula_5 (on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonians, this means formula_12 and formula_9 are anticommuting matrices).\n\nTime reversal is an antiunitary operator formula_14, that acts on formula_15, (where formula_16, is an arbitrary complex coefficient, and formula_17, denotes complex conjugation) as formula_18. It can be written as formula_19 where formula_20 is the complex conjugation operator and formula_21 is a unitary matrix. Either formula_22 or formula_23. A Hamiltonian with time reversal symmetry satisfies formula_24, or on the level of first-quantised matrices, formula_25, for some choice of formula_21.\n\nCharge conjugation formula_27 is also an antiunitary operator which acts on formula_15 as formula_29, and can be written as formula_30 where formula_31 is unitary. Again either formula_32 or formula_33 depending on what formula_31 is. A Hamiltonian with particle hole symmetry satisfies formula_35, or on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonian matrices, formula_36, for some choice of formula_31.\n\nIn the Bloch Hamiltonian formalism for periodic crystals, where the Hamiltonian formula_38 acts on modes of crystal momentum formula_39, the chiral symmetry, TRS, and PHS conditions become formula_40, formula_41 and formula_42.\n\nIt is evident that if two of these three symmetries are present, then the third is also present, due to the relation formula_43.\n\nThe aforementioned discrete symmetries label 10 distinct discrete symmetry classes, which coincide with the Altland–Zirnbauer classes of random matrices.\n\nA bulk Hamiltonian in a particular symmetry group is restricted to be a Hermitian matrix with no zero-energy eigenvalues (i.e. so that the spectrum is \"gapped\" and the system is a bulk insulator) satisfying the symmetry constraints of the group. In the case of formula_44 dimensions, this Hamiltonian is a continuous function formula_38 of the formula_46 parameters in the Bloch momentum vector formula_47 in the Brillouin zone; then the symmetry constraints must hold for all formula_48.\n\nGiven two Hamiltonians formula_49 and formula_50, it may be possible to continuously deform formula_49 into formula_50 while maintaining the symmetry constraint and gap (that is, there exists continuous function formula_53 such that for all formula_54 the Hamiltonian has no zero eigenvalue and symmetry condition is maintained, and formula_55 and formula_56). Then we say that formula_49 and formula_50 are equivalent.\n\nHowever, it may also turn out that there is no such continuous deformation. in this case, physically if two materials with bulk Hamiltonians formula_49 and formula_50 respectively neighbour each other with an edge between them, when one continuously moves across the edge one must encounter a zero eigenvalue (as there is no continuous transformation that avoids this). This may manifest as a gapless zero energy edge mode or an electric current that only flows along the edge.\n\nAn interesting question is to ask, given a symmetry class and a dimension of the Brillouin zone, what are all the equivalence classes of Hamiltonians. Each equivalence class can be labeled by a topological invariant; two Hamiltonians whose topological invariant are different cannot be deformed into each other and belong to different equivalence classes.\n\nFor each of the symmetry classes, the question can be simplified by deforming the Hamiltonian into a \"projective\" Hamiltonian, and considering the symmetric space in which such Hamiltonians live. These classifying spaces are shown for each symmetry class:\n\nFor example, a (real symmetric) Hamiltonian in symmetry class AI can have its formula_61 positive eigenvalues deformed to +1 and its formula_62 negative eigenvalues deformed to -1; the resulting such matrices are described by the union of real Grassmannians formula_63\n\nThe strong topological invariants of a many-band system in formula_46 dimensions can be labeled by the elements of the formula_46-th homotopy group of the symmetric space. These groups are displayed in this table, called the periodic table of topological insulators:\n\nThere may also exist weak topological invariants (associated to the fact that the suspension of the Brillouin zone is in fact equivalent to a formula_66 sphere wedged with lower-dimensional spheres), which are not included in this table. Furthermore, the table assumes the limit of an infinite number of bands, i.e. involves formula_67 Hamiltonians for formula_68.\n\nThe table also is periodic in the sense that the group of invariants in formula_46 dimensions is the same as the group of invariants in formula_70 dimensions. In the case of no antiunitary symmetries, the invariant groups are periodic in dimension by 2.\n\nFor nontrivial symmetry classes, the actual invariant can be defined by one of the following integrals over all or part of the Brillouin zone: the Chern number, the Wess Zumino winding number, the Chern–Simons invariant, the Fu–Kane invariant.\n\nThe periodic table also displays a peculiar property: the invariant groups in formula_46 dimensions are identical to those in formula_72 dimensions but in a different symmetry class. Among the complex symmetry classes, the invariant group for A in formula_46 dimensions is the same as that for AIII in formula_72 dimensions, and vice versa. One can also imagine arranging each of the eight real symmetry classes on the Cartesian plane such that the formula_75 coordinate is formula_76 if time reversal symmetry is present and formula_77 if it is absent, and the formula_78 coordinate is formula_79 if particle hole symmetry is present and formula_77 if it is absent. Then the invariant group in formula_46 dimensions for a certain real symmetry class is the same as the invariant group in formula_72 dimensions for the symmetry class directly one space clockwise. This phenomenon was termed the \"Bott Clock\" by Kitaev, in reference to the Bott periodicity theorem.\n\nThe Bott Clock can be understood by considering the problem of Clifford algebra extensions. Near an interface between two inequivalent bulk materials, the Hamiltonian approaches a gap closing. To lowest order expansion in momentum slightly away from the gap closing, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a Dirac Hamiltonian formula_83. Here, formula_84 are a representation of the Clifford Algebra formula_85, while formula_86 is an added \"mass term\" that and anticommutes with the rest of the Hamiltonian and vanishes at the interface (thus giving the interface a gapless edge mode at formula_87). The formula_86 term for the Hamiltonian on one side of the interface cannot be continuously deformed into the formula_86 term for the Hamiltonian on the other side of the interface. Thus (letting formula_90 be an arbitrary positive scalar) the problem of classifying topological invariants reduces to the problem of classifying all possible inequivalent choices of formula_91 to extend the Clifford algebra to one higher dimension, while maintaining the symmetry constraints.\n"}
{"id": "51047974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51047974", "title": "Post-truth politics", "text": "Post-truth politics\n\nPost-truth politics (also called post-factual politics and post-reality politics) is a political culture in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion disconnected from the details of policy, and by the repeated assertion of talking points to which factual rebuttals are ignored. Post-truth differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of facts by relegating facts and expert opinions to be of secondary importance relative to appeal to emotion. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, some observers have described it as a long-standing part of political life that was less notable before the advent of the Internet and related social changes.\n\nAccording to Oxford Dictionaries, the term \"post-truth\" was first used in a 1992 essay by the late Serbian-American playwright Steve Tesich in \"The Nation\". Tesich writes that following the shameful truth of Watergate, more assuaging coverage of the Iran–Contra scandal and Persian Gulf War demonstrate that \"we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world.\" In 2004, Ralph Keyes used the term \"post-truth era\" in his book by that title. The same year American journalist Eric Alterman spoke of a \"post-truth political environment\" and coined the term \"the post-truth presidency\" in his analysis of the misleading statements made by the Bush administration after 9/11. In his 2004 book \"Post-democracy\", Colin Crouch used the phrase \"post-democracy\" to mean a model of politics where \"elections certainly exist and can change governments,\" but \"public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams.\" Crouch directly attributes the \"advertising industry model\" of political communication to the crisis of trust and accusations of dishonesty that a few years later others have associated with post-truth politics.\n\nThe term \"post-truth politics\" was coined by the blogger David Roberts in a blog post for \"Grist\" on 1 April 2010, where it was defined as \"a political culture in which politics (public opinion and media narratives) have become almost entirely disconnected from policy (the substance of legislation)\". Post truth was used by philosopher Joseph Heath to describe the 2014 Ontario election. The term became widespread during the campaigns for the 2016 presidential election in the United States and the 2016 \"Brexit\" referendum on membership in the European Union in the United Kingdom. Oxford Dictionaries declared that its international word of the year in 2016 is \"post-truth\", citing a 2,000% increase in usage compared to 2015.\n\nJennifer Hochschild, H.L. Jayne Professor of Government at Harvard University, has described the rise of post-truth as a return to 18th and 19th century political and media practices in the United States, following a period in the 20th century where the media was relatively balanced and rhetoric was toned down. (Not so in Britain and elsewhere necessarily; for example, in 1957 scientist Kathleen Lonsdale remarked that \"for many people truthfulness in politics has now become a mockery... Anyone who listens to the radio in a mixed company of thinking people knows how deep-seated is this cynicism.\" ) \n\nThe pamphlet wars that arose with the growth of printing and literacy beginning in the 1600s have been described as an early form of post-truth politics. Slanderous and vitriolic pamphlets were cheaply printed and widely disseminated, and the dissent that they fomented contributed to starting wars and revolutions such as the English Civil War and the American War of Independence.\n\nA defining trait of post-truth politics is that campaigners continue to repeat their talking points, even when media outlets, experts in the field in question, and others provide proof that contradicts these talking points. For example, during campaigning for the British EU referendum campaign, Vote Leave made repeated use of the claim that EU membership cost £350 million a week, although later began to use the figure as a net amount of money sent directly to the EU. This figure, which ignored the UK rebate and other factors, was described as \"potentially misleading\" by the UK Statistics Authority, as \"not sensible\" by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and was rejected in fact checks by BBC News, Channel 4 News and Full Fact. Vote Leave nevertheless continued to use the figure as a centrepiece of their campaign until the day of the referendum, after which point they downplayed the pledge as having been an \"example\", pointing out that it was only ever suggested as a possible alternative use of the net funds sent to the EU. Tory MP and Leave campaigner Sarah Wollaston, who left the group in protest during its campaign, criticised its \"post-truth politics\".\n\nMichael Deacon, parliamentary sketchwriter for \"The Daily Telegraph\", summarised the core message of post-truth politics as \"Facts are negative. Facts are pessimistic. Facts are unpatriotic.\" He added that post-truth politics can also include a claimed rejection of partisanship and negative campaigning. In this context, campaigners can push a utopian \"positive campaign\" to which rebuttals can be dismissed as smears and scaremongering and opposition as partisan.\n\nIn its most extreme mode, post-truth politics can make use of conspiracism. In this form of post-truth politics, false rumors (such as the \"birther\" or \"Muslim\" conspiracy theories about Barack Obama) become major news topics. In the case of the \"pizzagate\" conspiracy, this resulted in a man entering the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria and firing an AR-15 rifle.\n\nIn contrast to simply telling untruths, writers such as Jack Holmes of \"Esquire\" describe the process as something different, with Holmes putting it as: \"So, if you don't know what's true, you can say whatever you want and it's not a lie\".\n\nIn 2015 media and Politics scholar Jayson Harsin coined the term \"regime of post-truth\" which encompasses many aspects of post-truth politics. He argues that a convergent set of developments have created the conditions of post-truth society: the political communication informed by cognitive science, which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like microtargeting which includes the strategic use of rumors and falsehoods; the fragmentation of modern, more centralized mass news media gatekeepers, which have largely repeated one another's scoops and their reports; the attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration, user-generated content and fewer society-wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies, accurate and inaccurate; the algorithms which govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings, based on what users want (per algorithm) and not on what is factual; and news media which have been marred by scandals of plagiarism, hoaxes, propaganda, and changing news values. These developments have occurred on the background of economic crises, downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditional tabloid stories and styles of reporting, known as tabloidization and infotainment. \n\nWhile some of these phenomena (such as a more tabloidesque press) may suggest a return to the past, the effect of the convergences is a socio-political phenomenon which exceeds earlier forms of journalism in deliberate distortion and struggle. Fact-checking and rumor-busting sites abound, but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences (attention-wise) and their respective trustful-/distrustfulness. Harsin has called it a \"regime of post-truth\" instead of merely post-truth politics, professional pan-partisan political communication manipulates the communication competitively.\n\nSeveral trends in the media landscape have been blamed for the perceived rise of post-truth politics. One contributing factor has been the proliferation of state-funded news agencies like CCTV News and RT, and Voice of America in the USA which allow states to influence Western audiences. According to Peter Pomerantsev, a British-Russian journalist who worked for TNT in Moscow, one of their prime objectives has been to de-legitimize Western institutions, including the structures of government, democracy, and human rights. \nAs of 2016, trust in the mainstream media in the US had reached historical lows. \nIt has been suggested that under these conditions, fact checking by news outlets struggles to gain traction among the wider public and that politicians resort to increasingly drastic messaging.\n\nMany news outlets desire to appear to be, or have a policy of being, impartial. Many writers have noted that in some cases, this leads to false balance, the practice of giving equal emphasis to unsupported or discredited claims without challenging their factual basis. The 24-hour news cycle also means that news channels repeatedly draw on the same public figures, which benefits PR-savvy politicians and means that presentation and personality can have a larger impact on the audience than facts, while the process of claim and counter-claim can provide grist for days of news coverage at the expense of deeper analysis of the case.\n\nSocial media adds an additional dimension, as user networks can become echo chambers possibly emphasised by the filter bubble where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails, allowing a parallel media ecosystem of websites, publishers and news channels to develop, which can repeat post-truth claims without rebuttal.\nIn this environment, post-truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss them as being motivated by bias. \"The Guardian\" editor-in-chief Katherine Viner laid some of the blame on the rise of clickbait, articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline and which are designed to be widely shared, saying that \"chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity\" undermines the value of journalism and truth. In 2016, David Mikkelson, co-founder of the fact checking and debunking site \"Snopes.com\", described the introduction of social media and fake news sites as a turning point, saying \"I’m not sure I’d call it a post-truth age but … there’s been an opening of the sluice-gate and everything is pouring through. The bilge keeps coming faster than you can pump.\"\n\nThe digital culture allows anybody with a computer and access to the internet to post their opinions online and mark them as fact which may become legitimized through echo-chambers and other users validating one another. Content may be judged based on how many views a post gets, creating an atmosphere that appeals to emotion, audience biases, or headline appeal instead of researched fact. Content which gets more views is continually filtered around different internet circles, regardless of its legitimacy. Some also argue that the abundance of fact available at any time on the internet leads to an attitude focused on knowing basic claims to information instead of an underlying truth or formulating carefully thought-out opinions. The internet allows people to choose where they get their information, allowing them to reinforce their own opinions.\n\nThe rise of post-truth politics coincides with polarized political beliefs. A Pew Research Center study of American adults found that \"those with the most consistent ideological views on the left and right have information streams that are distinct from those of individuals with more mixed political views—and very distinct from each other\". Data is becoming increasingly accessible as new technologies are introduced to the everyday lives of citizens. An obsession for data and statistics also filters into the political scene, and political debates and speeches become filled with snippets of information that may be misconstrued, false, or not contain the whole picture. Sensationalized television news emphasizes grand statements and further publicizes politicians. This shaping from the media influences how the public views political issues and candidates.\n\nIn an editorial, \"New Scientist\" suggested \"a cynic might wonder if politicians are actually any more dishonest than they used to be\", and hypothesized that \"fibs once whispered into select ears are now overheard by everyone\". Similarly, Viner suggested that while social media has helped some untruths to spread, it has also restrained others; as an example, she said \"The Sun\"s false \"The Truth\" story following the Hillsborough disaster, and the associated police cover-up, would be hard to imagine in the social media age. The journalist George Gillett has suggested that the term \"post-truth\" mistakenly conflates empirical and ethical judgements, writing that the supposedly \"post-truth\" movement is in fact a rebellion against \"expert economic opinion becoming a surrogate for values-based political judgements\".\n\nToby Young, writing for \"The Spectator\", called the term a \"cliché\" used selectively primarily by left-wing commentators to attack what are actually universal ideological biases, contending that \"[w]e are all post-truthers and probably always have been\". \"The Economist\" has called this argument \"complacent\", however, identifying a qualitative difference between political scandals of previous generations, such as those surrounding the Suez Crisis and the Iran–Contra affair (which involved attempting to cover-up the truth) and contemporary ones in which public facts are simply ignored. Similarly, Alexios Mantzarlis of the Poynter Institute said that political lies were not new and identified several political campaigns in history which would now be described as \"post-truth\". For Mantzarlis, the \"post-truth\" label was—to some extent—a \"coping mechanism for commentators reacting to attacks on not just any facts, but on those central to their belief system\", but also noted that 2016 had been \"an acrimonious year for politics on both sides of the Atlantic\". Mantzarlis also noted that interest in fact checking had never been higher, suggesting that at least part of the electorate rejects \"post-truth\" politics.\n\nDavid Helfand argues, following Edward M. Harris, that \"public prevarication is nothing new\" and that it is the \"knowledge of the audience\" and the \"limits of plausibility\" within a technology-saturated environment that have changed. We are, rather, in an age of misinformation where such limits of plausibility have vanished and where everyone feels equally qualified to make claims that are easily shared and propagated.\n\nPost-truth politics has been applied as a political buzzword to a wide range of political cultures; one article in \"The Economist\" identified post-truth politics in Austria, Germany, North Korea, Poland, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIn December 2016 \"\" (post-factual) was named word of the year by the \"Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache\" (\"German language society\"), also in connection with a rise of right-wing populism from 2015 on. Since the 1990s, \"post-democracy\" was used in sociology more and more.\n\nAmulya Gopalakrishnan, columnist for \"The Times of India\", identified similarities between the Trump and Brexit campaigns on the one hand, and hot-button issues in India such as the Ishrat Jahan case and the ongoing case against Teesta Setalvad on the other, where accusations of forged evidence and historical revisionism have resulted in an \"ideological impasse\".\n\nHealth care and education in South Africa was substantially compromised during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki due to his HIV/AIDS denialism.\n\nAn early use of the phrase in British politics was in March 2012 by Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray in criticising the difference between Scottish National Party's claims and official statistics. Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy also described an undercurrent of post-truth politics in which people \"cheerfully shot the messenger\" when presented with facts that didn't support their viewpoint, seeing it among pro-independence campaigners in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Jeremy Corbyn supporters in the 2015 Labour leadership election, and Leave campaigners in the then-upcoming EU membership referendum.\n\nPost-truth politics has been retroactively identified in the lead-up to the Iraq War, particularly after the Chilcot Report, published in July 2016, concluded that Tony Blair misrepresented military intelligence to support his view that Iraq's chemical weapons program was advanced.\n\nThe phrase became widely used during the 2016 UK EU membership referendum to describe the Leave campaign. Faisal Islam, political editor for Sky News, said that Michael Gove used \"post-fact politics\" that were imported from the Trump campaign; in particular, Gove's comment in an interview that \"I think people in this country have had enough of experts...\" was singled out as illustrative of a post-truth trend, although this is only part of a longer statement. Similarly, Arron Banks, the founder of the unofficial Leave.EU campaign, said that \"facts don't work ... You've got to connect with people emotionally. It's the Trump success.\" Andrea Leadsom—a prominent campaigner for Leave in the EU referendum and one of the two final candidates in the Conservative leadership election—has been singled out as a post-truth politician, especially after she denied having disparaged rival Theresa May's childlessness in an interview with \"The Times\" in spite of transcript evidence.\n\nIn its original formulation, the phrase \"post-truth politics\" was used to describe the paradoxical situation in the United States where the Republican Party, which enforced stricter party discipline than the Democratic Party, was nevertheless able to present itself as more bipartisan, since individual Democrats were more likely to support Republican policies than vice versa. The term was used by Paul Krugman in \"The New York Times\" to describe Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign in which certain claims—such as that Barack Obama had cut defense spending and that he had embarked on an \"apology tour\"—continued to be repeated long after they had been debunked. Other forms of scientific denialism in modern American politics include the anti-vaxxer movement, and the belief that existing genetically modified foods are harmful despite a strong scientific consensus that no currently marketed GMO foods have any negative health effects. The health freedom movement in the U.S. resulted in the passage of the bipartisan Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which allows the sale of dietary supplements without any evidence that they are safe or effective for the purposes consumers expect, though the FDA has begun regulation of homeopathic products.\n\nIn a review for the \"Harvard Gazette\", Christopher Robichaud—a lecturer in ethics and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School—described conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of elections and politicians, such as the \"birther\" idea that Barack Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen, as one side-effect of post-truth politics. Robichaud also contrasted the behaviour of the candidates with that following the contested result of the 2000 election, in which Al Gore conceded and encouraged his supporters to accept the result of \"Bush v. Gore\". Similarly, Rob Boston, writing for \"The Humanist\" saw a rise in conspiracy theories across American public life, including Birtherism, climate change denialism, and rejecting evolution, which he identified as a result of post-truth politics, noting that the existence of extensive and widely available evidence against these conspiracy theories had not slowed their growth.\n\nIn 2016, the \"post-truth\" label was especially widely used to describe the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, including by Professor Daniel W. Drezner in \"The Washington Post\", Jonathan Freedland in \"The Guardian\", Chris Cillizza in \"The Independent\", Jeet Heer in \"The New Republic\", and James Kirchick in the \"Los Angeles Times\", and by several professors of government and history at Harvard. In 2017, \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", and others, have pointed out lies or falsehoods in Trump's statements after the election. Former president Barack Obama stated that the new media ecosystem \"means everything is true and nothing is true\".\n\nAlthough the consensus among scientists is that human activities contribute to global warming, several political parties around the world have made climate change denial a basis of their policies. These parties have been accused of using post-truth techniques to attack environmental measures meant to combat climate changes to benefit industry donors. During the course of the most recent 2016 election, the United States has seen numerous climate change deniers rise to power, such as new Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt replacing Barack Obama's appointee Gina McCarthy. In Australia, the repeal of carbon pricing by the government of Tony Abbott was described as \"the nadir of post-truth politics\" by \"The Age\".\n\nBoth technology companies and governments have started to make efforts to tackle the challenge of \"post-truth politics\". In an article for the journal \"Global Policy\", professor Nayef Al-Rodhan suggested four particular responses:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1180739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1180739", "title": "Predicable", "text": "Predicable\n\nPredicable (Lat. praedicabilis, that which may be stated or affirmed, sometimes called \"quinque voces\" or \"five words\") is, in scholastic logic, a term applied to a classification of the possible relations in which a predicate may stand to its subject. It is not to be confused with 'praedicamenta', the schoolmen's term for Aristotle's ten Categories.\n\nThe list given by the schoolmen and generally adopted by modern logicians is based on the original fivefold classification given by Aristotle (Topics, a iv. 101 b 17-25): definition (\"horos\"), genus (\"genos\"), differentia (\"diaphora\"), property (\"idion\"), and accident (\"sumbebekos\"). The scholastic classification, obtained from Boëthius's Latin version of Porphyry's \"Isagoge\", modified Aristotle's by substituting species (\"eidos\") for definition. Both classifications are of universals, concepts or general terms, proper names of course being excluded. There is, however, a radical difference between the two systems. The standpoint of the Aristotelian classification is the predication of one universal concerning another. The Porphyrian, by introducing species, deals with the predication of universals concerning individuals (for species is necessarily predicated of the individual), and thus created difficulties from which the Aristotelian is free (see below).\n\nThe Aristotelian classification is: \n\nThis classification, though it is of high value in the clearing up of our conceptions of the essential contrasted with the accidental, the relation of genus, differentia and definition and so forth, is of more significance in connection with abstract sciences, especially mathematics, than for the physical sciences. It is superior on the whole to the Porphyrian scheme, which has grave defects. As has been said, the Porphyrian scheme classifies universals as predicates of individuals and thus involves the difficulties which gave rise to the controversy between realism and nominalism. How are we to distinguish species from genus? Napoleon was a Frenchman, a man, an animal. In the second place how do we distinguish property and accident? Many so-called accidents are predicable necessarily of any particular persons. This difficulty gave rise to the distinction of separable and inseparable accidents, which is one of considerable difficulty.\n\nSome Aristotelian examples may be briefly mentioned. In the true statement “Man is a rational animal,” the predicate is convertible with the subject and states its essence; therefore, “rational animal” is the definition of man. The statements “Man is an animal” and “Man is rational,” while true, are not convertible; their predicate terms, however, are parts of the definition and hence are the genus and differentia of man. On the other hand, the statement “Man is capable of learning grammar” is true and convertible; but “capable of learning grammar” does not state the essence of man and is therefore a property of man. The true statement “Man is featherless” offers an example of an accident. Its predicate is not convertible with its subject, nor is it part of the definition; accordingly, it expresses only an accidental characteristic of man.\n"}

The word implies that these judgments (and the prescription and condemnation) logically commit us to certain ways of living. Contrary to popular opinion prescriptivity does not just describe or categorize decisions for example; \"You ought to do this\" (used evaluatively) logically entails the imperative \"Do this.\"\n\nPrescriptivity is one of the five (prescriptivity, universalizability, overridingness, publicity, and practicability) axioms of Formal Ethics. When combined with Universalizability, prescriptivity becomes Universal prescriptivism. Universal precriptivism combines these two methods of thinking, combining evaluative judgments (which commit us to making similar judgments about similar cases) and prescription and condemnation when the judgment is at last made. This enables us to think in a very powerful and rational way about ethical and moral issues.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30834503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30834503", "title": "Ridiculous", "text": "Ridiculous\n\nTo be ridiculous is to be something which is highly incongruous or inferior, sometimes deliberately so to make people laugh or get their attention, and sometimes unintendedly so as to be considered laughable and earn or provoke ridicule and derision. It comes from the 1540s Latin \"ridiculosus\" meaning \"laughable\", from \"ridiculus\" meaning \"that which excites laughter\", and from \"ridere\" meaning \"to laugh\". \"Ridiculous\" is an adjective describing \"the ridiculous\".\n\nIn common usage, \"ridiculousness\" is used as a synonym for absurdity or nonsense. From a historical and technical viewpoint, \"absurdity\" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, \"nonsense\" with semantics and meaning, while \"ridiculous\" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. \"Reductio ad absurdum\" is a valid method of argument, while \"reductio ad ridiculum\" is invalid. Argument by invective declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a cogent semantic problem with lack or meaning or ambiguity.\n\nHistorically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher Thomas Hobbes. It is currently used in the theory of humor to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in psychology for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the sublime, one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.\n\nThe ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., \"when something that was dignified is reduced to a\nridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter\nis most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'.\" For Aristotle, we laugh at inferior or ugly individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them. Socrates was reported by Plato as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance. Deformity was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous. Psychological theories of humor include the \"incongruity theory\" and the \"superiority theory\", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent. Hobbes claimed that laughter was either caused spontaneously, or by seeing a deformed thing to which one compares themselves and laugh as a form of self applause; \"a sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison of the infirmities of others.\" The Right Reverend William Warburton, Lord Bishop of Gloucester said in the early 18th century that, \"Nothing is ridiculous but what is deformed\". Using the ridiculous is a method in the theory of humor.\n\nAlthough common usage now considers \"absurdity\" to be synonymous with \"ridiculousness\", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning, as in Hobbes' Table of Absurdity, while ridiculousness has to do with laughter, superiority, ridicule, and deformity.\n\nThe Ritual clown (Heyókȟa) in some Native American culture uses the painfully ridiculous, and is believed to become closer to the gods by its primordiality. Native American clowns are ridiculous in their contrary and rule breaking antics. In the film \"Little Big Man\", the sacred clown rides sitting backwards on his horse, \"washes\" himself with dirt and \"dries\" himself with water. Heyókȟa are thought of as being incongruously backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This spirit is often manifest by doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking backwards. For example, if food were scarce, a Heyókȟa would sit around and complain about how full he was; during a baking hot heat wave a Heyókȟa would shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is 40 degrees below freezing he will wander around naked for hours complaining that it is too hot.\n\nThe ridiculous can use uses both physical and conceptual inferiority and incongruity of juxtaposition to create parody and satire.\n\nIn \"Candide\", Voltaire parodies Leibniz's argument for the existence of evil under a benign God using \"ridiculous rationalizations of evil\". Leibniz claimed that God is constrained by logic, and created the best of all \"possible worlds\". After being reduced from a \"dignified\" state to its opposite, the optimistic Dr. Pangloss (representing Leibniz) finds cause to consider his undignified position to be the best of all possible worlds, noting his own particular current happiness, which he argues could not have been attained without experiencing the atrocities in the previous narrative; his optimistic attitude is extremely incongruous with his experiences and extremely inferior undignified ultimate condition.\n\nIn Stanley Kubrick's \"\", apelike humans and their behavior are juxtaposed next to streamlined advanced technology with a highly avant garde score by composer György Ligeti; Ligeti also used ridiculous juxtaposition in his scores to create parody, and this tool was frequently used by composer Peter Maxwell Davies.\n\nJapanese Butoh uses both incongruity and deformity to create ridiculous dance performance and lifestyle; extreme movement methods that are highly incongruous with natural body movement in its dance and everyday lifestyle, as well as in its clothing, actions, costume and set design that is highly incongruous with societal norms, which often shock the audience or visitor, and are sometimes considered not only ridiculous, but incongruently \"bizarre and beautiful\" or \"elegant and grotesque\".\n\nThe Theatre of the Ridiculous uses highly incongruous stage settings and incongruous costumes such as cross dressing to disturb or create shock in the audience.\n\nPsychologists have studied human response to the ridiculous and its effects on attention and memory.\n\nThe ridiculous is used in advertising to manipulate attention and attitudes toward products.\n\nThe ridiculous is sometimes contrasted to the sublime where something with one quality is thought of as approaching, or likely to change to, the other.\n\nThomas Paine, writing in \"The Age of Reason\" in 1795, said \"The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime, makes the ridiculous; and one step above the ridiculous, makes the sublime again.\"\n\nNapoleon, reflecting on the state of his existence following his retreat from Moscow in 1812, famously remarked to Polish ambassador D. G. De Pradt: \"Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas\" (\"There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous\").\n\nReduction to the ridiculous (Latin: \"reductio ad ridiculum\", also called \"Appeal to ridicule\", \"appeal to mockery\", or \"the Horse Laugh\") is a logical fallacy which presents the opponent's argument in a way that grossly misrepresents it and appears ridiculous next to it, often so misrepresentative as to create a straw man argument, rather than addressing the argument itself. For example, in arguing against idealism, with its sophisticated arguments that the world was not real but only existed in the mind, philosopher Dr. Johnson famously kicked a stone.\n\nContrasting ridiculousness with absurdity in reasoning, \"Reductio ad ridiculum\" is an invalid method of argument, while \"reductio ad absurdum\" is a valid method.\n\nArguments are often simply dismissed by calling them \"ridiculous\" as invective, without further argumentation.

Kristin Neff has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components – self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.\n\n\nSelf-compassion has been considered to resemble Carl Rogers' notion of \"unconditional positive regard\" applied both towards clients and oneself; Albert Ellis' \"unconditional self-acceptance\"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an \"internal empathizer\" that explored one's own experience with \"curiosity and compassion\"; Ann Weiser Cornell's notion of a gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being; and Judith Jordan's concept of \"self-empathy\", which implies acceptance, care and empathy towards the self.\n\nSelf-compassion is different from self-pity, a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to cope with an adverse situation.\n\nResearch indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion. For example, self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, wisdom, happiness, optimism, curiosity, learning goals, social connectedness, personal responsibility, and emotional resilience. At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for self-criticism, depression, anxiety, rumination, thought suppression, perfectionism, and disordered eating attitudes.\n\nSelf-compassion has different effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem, including narcissism, distorted self-perceptions, contingent and/or unstable self-worth, as well as anger and violence toward those who threaten the ego. It appears that self-compassion offers the same mental health benefits as self-esteem, but with fewer of its drawbacks such as narcissism, ego-defensive anger, inaccurate self-perceptions, self-worth contingency, or social comparison.\n\nMuch of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by Kristin Neff, which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over-identification.\n\nThe Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages. Some of these include a Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish and Greek version.\n\nThe original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.\n\nThe next stage of development involved testing the reliability and validity of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items. Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26. The self-compassion scales have good reliability and validity.\n\nA second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between self-esteem and self-compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students. Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in questionnaire form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory. Based on the findings, Neff reports \"that self-compassion and self-esteem were measuring two different psychological phenomena.\"\n\nA third study was conducted to examine the construct validity. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three Buddhist practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a self-esteem scale. The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.\n\nThe long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.\n\nPresented on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.\n\nA shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items.\n\nThe short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English. Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale. A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version.\n\nNeff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way. Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.\n\nCurrently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.\n\nThe generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students.\n\nA recent study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.\n\nLopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale.\n\nSelf-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness. These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination. In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.\n\nThis exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.\n\nThis exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.\n\nIn this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.\n\nThis exercise asks the user to occupy several \"chairs\" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.\n\nThis exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.\n\nThis exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).\n\nIn this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.\n\nThis exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.\n\nSelf-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.\n\nWhen self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing. Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.\n\nSelf-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from self-esteem in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.\n\nThe concept of mindfulness and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist meditation. In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing. The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way. Compassion (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering. Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a grounded way in order to avoid \"over-identification\". Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences. Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.\n\nMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a structured group program that uses mindfulness meditation to relieve suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health. The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Clinical research from the past 25 years has found that MBSR is efficacious in reducing distress and enhancing individual well-being. Self-Compassion can play a critical role in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy interventions. In the study Shapiro et al. (2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.\n\nMindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of major depression. MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance. Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may causes a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT. Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms. They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.\n\nMindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices. The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion. The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis. MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves. The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives. A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.\n\nPaul Gilbert (2009) developed compassion focused therapy (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own. Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as \"I'm unlovable\" and provide alternative self-statements, such as \"know for sure that some people love me\". The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself. This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self-compassionate behaviors and habits. In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system.\n\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT), is a derivative of cognitive behavior therapy that incorporates Eastern meditative practice. DBT is based on a dialectical world view that incorporates the balance and integration of opposing beliefs, particularly in acceptance and change. We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow. Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions. In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions. The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills. Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve emotional dysregulation.\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences. It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful. In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, problem solving skills and psychological flexibility. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful. Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self. Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable. In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes & Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2480342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2480342", "title": "Ship of State", "text": "Ship of State\n\nThe Ship of State is a famous and oft-cited metaphor put forth by Plato in Book VI of the \"Republic\" (488a–489d). It likens the governance of a city-state to the command of a naval vessel and ultimately argues that the only men fit to be captain of this ship () are philosopher kings, benevolent men with absolute power who have access to the Form of the Good. The origins of the metaphor can be traced back to the lyric poet Alcaeus (frs. 6, 208, 249), and it is found in Sophocles’ Antigone and Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes before Plato.\n\nPlato establishes the comparison by saying that God was one of the best models of describing the steering of a ship as just like any other \"craft\" or profession — in particular, that of a statesman. He then runs the metaphor in reference to a particular type of government: democracy. Plato’s democracy is not the modern notion of a mix of democracy and republicanism, but rather direct democracy by way of pure majority rule. In the metaphor, found at 488a-489d, Plato's Socrates compares the population at large to a strong but nearsighted shipowner whose knowledge of seafaring is lacking. The quarreling sailors are demagogues and politicians, and the ship's navigator, a stargazer, is the philosopher. The sailors flatter themselves with claims to knowledge of sailing, though they know nothing of navigation, and are constantly vying with one another for the approval of the shipowner so to captain the ship, going so far as to stupefy the shipowner with drugs and wine. Meanwhile, they dismiss the navigator as a useless stargazer, though he is the only one with adequate knowledge to direct the ship's course.\n\nIt has been routinely referenced throughout Western culture ever since its inception; two notable literary examples are Horace's ode 1.14 and \"O Ship of State\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, used the metaphor in his Letter to the Town of Providence (1656).\n\nMore recently, it has become a staple of American political discussion, where it is viewed simply as its image of the state as a ship, in need of a government as officers to command it – and conspicuously absent of its anti-democratic, pro-absolutist original meaning.\n\nThe term has entered popular culture as well. Leonard Cohen's song \"Democracy\" contains the line \"Sail on. Sail on, o mighty ship of state. To the shores of need, past the reefs of greed, through the squalls of hate.\" Also, in his second novel 'Beautiful Losers' (1966) Cohen writes \"Sail on, sail on, O Ship of State, auto accidents, births, Berlin, cures for cancer!\" (p. 12). In the British TV series Yes, Minister, Sir Humphrey Appleby pointed out that \"the Ship of State is the only ship that leaks from the top\".\n\nBeyond the political metaphor, in the 20th century \"Ship of State\" became a term applied to ocean liners which were built to be floating symbols of a state's artistic and technological advancement; normally flagships of the country's most successful passenger shipping line, and the construction of which was often subsidised by the state government. Examples of liners considered Ships of State are the RMS \"Queen Mary\" (United Kingdom), SS \"Normandie\" (France), SS \"Rex\" (Italy), SS \"France\" (France), RMS \"Queen Mary 2\" (United Kingdom), and SS \"United States\" (United States).\n\n"}
{"id": "4347189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4347189", "title": "Suspect classification", "text": "Suspect classification\n\nIn American jurisprudence, a suspect classification is any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an Equal Protection claim alleging unconstitutional discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.\n\nStrict scrutiny is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a \"suspect classification.\" The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.\n\nSome of the criteria that have been cited include:\n\nThe Supreme Court established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of \"Hirabayashi v. United States\", 320 U.S. 81 and \"Korematsu v. United States\", 323 U.S. 214 (1944). The Supreme Court recognizes race, national origin, religion and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under strict scrutiny.\n\nIn \"Perry v. Schwarzenegger\", the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a suspect class but, on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review. The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska held the same in \"Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning\", but was reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\nAs the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such. \n\nAlienage, or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of state law, legal aliens are a suspect class (\"Graham v. Richardson\", 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the United States Congress has the power to regulate immigration, federal government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive rational basis scrutiny. State acts that affect unlawful immigrants are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on \"Plyler v. Doe\", 457 U.S. 202 (1982).\n\nIntermediate scrutiny is applied to groups that fall under a \"quasi-suspect classification.\" Gender and legitimacy of birth have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for \nNorthern California discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision. Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in \"Windsor v. United States\" (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny. It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case. The Supreme Court however has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class.\n\nRational basis scrutiny is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria—\"e.g.\", age, disability, wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.\n\nTo satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest.\n\nThe practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's race, skin color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with national security, defense, or affirmative action. \"Korematsu v. United States\", regarding Japanese internment, and \"Grutter v. Bollinger\", upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test.\n\nStrict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any fundamental right, regardless of the group involved.\n\nWhen intermediate scrutiny is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes. Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 102 S.Ct. 3331 (1982), Nguyen v. INS, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (2001).\n\nWhen rational basis review is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.\n\nThe Supreme Court's holdings impose a minimum standard to which each State must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior federal courts using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum federal standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the Supreme Court of California used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a California statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nCalifornia classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. Connecticut and Iowa classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.\n"}

Thermoeconomics can be thought of as the statistical physics of economic value and is a subfield of econophysics.\n\nThermoeconomists maintain that human economic systems can be modeled as thermodynamic systems. Thermoeconomists argue that economic systems always involve matter, energy, entropy, and information. Then, based on this premise, theoretical economic analogs of the first and second laws of thermodynamics are developed.\n\nMoreover, many economic activities result in the formation of structures. Thermoeconomics applies the statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to model these activities. In thermodynamic terminology, human economic activity may be described as a dissipative system, which flourishes by consuming free energy in transformations and exchange of resources, goods, and services.\n\nThermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood not through the second law of thermodynamics but in terms of such economic criteria as productivity, efficiency, and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24047271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24047271", "title": "Type constructor", "text": "Type constructor\n\nIn the area of mathematical logic and computer science known as type theory, a type constructor is a feature of a typed formal language that builds new types from old ones. Basic types are considered to be built using nullary type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for product types, function types, power types and list types. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors.\n\nFor example, simply typed lambda calculus can be seen as a language with a single type constructor—the function type constructor. Product types can generally be considered \"built-in\" in typed lambda calculi via currying.\n\nAbstractly, a type constructor is an \"n\"-ary type operator taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type. Making use of currying, \"n\"-ary type operators can be (re)written as a sequence of applications of unary type operators. Therefore, we can view the type operators as a simply typed lambda calculus, which has only one basic type, usually denoted formula_1, and pronounced \"type\", which is the type of all types in the underlying language, which are now called \"proper types\" in order to distinguish them from the types of the type operators in their own calculus, which are called \"kinds\".\n\nInstituting a simply typed lambda calculus over the type operators results in more than just a formalization of type constructors though. Higher-order type operators become possible. Type operators correspond to the 2nd axis in the lambda cube, leading to the simply typed lambda-calculus with type operators, λ; while this is not so well known, combining type operators with polymorphic lambda calculus (system F) yields system F-omega.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1609504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1609504", "title": "Viète's formula", "text": "Viète's formula\n\nIn mathematics, Viète's formula is the following infinite product of nested radicals representing the mathematical constant :\nIt is named after François Viète (1540–1603), who published it in 1593 in his work \"Variorum de rebus mathematicis responsorum, liber VIII\".\n\nAt the time Viète published his formula, methods for approximating to (in principle) arbitrary accuracy had long been known. Viète's own method can be interpreted as a variation of an idea of Archimedes of approximating the length of a circle by the perimeter of a many-sided polygon, used by Archimedes to find the approximation\nHowever, by publishing his method as a mathematical formula, Viète formulated the first instance of an infinite product known in mathematics, and the first example of an explicit formula for the exact value of . As the first formula representing a number as the result of an infinite process rather than of a finite calculation, Viète's formula has been noted as the beginning of mathematical analysis and even more broadly as \"the dawn of modern mathematics\".\n\nUsing his formula, Viète calculated to an accuracy of nine decimal digits. However, this was not the most accurate approximation to known at the time, as the Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī had calculated to an accuracy of nine sexagesimal digits and 16 decimal digits in 1424. Not long after Viète published his formula, Ludolph van Ceulen used a closely related method to calculate 35 digits of , which were published only after van Ceulen's death in 1610.\n\nViète's formula may be rewritten and understood as a limit expression\nwhere , with initial condition . Viète did his work long before the concepts of limits and rigorous proofs of convergence were developed in mathematics; the first proof that this limit exists was not given until the work of Ferdinand Rudio in 1891.\n\nThe rate of convergence of a limit governs the number of terms of the expression needed to achieve a given number of digits of accuracy. In the case of Viète's formula, there is a linear relation between the number of terms and the number of digits: the product of the first terms in the limit gives an expression for that is accurate to approximately digits. This convergence rate compares very favorably with the Wallis product, a later infinite product formula for . Although Viète himself only used his formula to calculate with nine-digit accuracy, an accelerated version of his formula has been used to calculate to hundreds of thousands of digits.\n\nViète's formula may be obtained as a special case of a formula given more than a century later by Leonhard Euler, who discovered that:\nSubstituting formula_5 in this formula yields:\nThen, expressing each term of the product on the right as a function of earlier terms using the half-angle formula:\ngives Viète's formula.\n\nIt is also possible to derive from Viète's formula a related formula for that still involves nested square roots of two, but uses only one multiplication:\n\nBy now many formulas similar to Viète's involving either nested radicals or infinite products of trigonometric functions are known for , as well as for other constants such as the golden ratio.\n\nViète obtained his formula by comparing the areas of regular polygons with and sides inscribed in a circle. The first term in the product, , is the ratio of areas of a square and an octagon, the second term is the ratio of areas of an octagon and a hexadecagon, etc. Thus, the product telescopes to give the ratio of areas of a square (the initial polygon in the sequence) to a circle (the limiting case of a -gon). Alternatively, the terms in the product may be instead interpreted as ratios of perimeters of the same sequence of polygons, starting with the ratio of perimeters of a digon (the diameter of the circle, counted twice) and a square, the ratio of perimeters of a square and an octagon, etc.\n\nAnother derivation is possible based on trigonometric identities and Euler's formula.\nBy repeatedly applying the double-angle formula\none may prove by mathematical induction that, for all positive integers ,\nThe term goes to in the limit as goes to infinity, from which Euler's formula follows. Viète's formula may be obtained from this formula by the substitution .\n\n"}

It occurred over two days, September 21 and 22 of 2011, across the street from a United Nations conference referred to as Durban III.\n\nThe summit was created in response to the United Nations' inclusion of countries that commit particularly atrocious human rights abuses, especially in the Human Rights Council, such as China, Syria, Sudan, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran. This claim has been supported by the Human Rights Foundation, a partner of the summit, whose President, Thor Halvorssen, refers to Durban III as “the last act in a tragicomedy” that underscores the UN’s complacency with “despotic regimes which speak pretty words about human rights while they kill, torture, or jail their opponents”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
