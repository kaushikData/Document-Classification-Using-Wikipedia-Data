Essentially, this model is used to show undergraduate students how shifts in demand or shocks to prices can affect real GDP around potential. The model assumes that when inflation rises the interest rate rises (monetary policy rule). It also assumes that when real GDP exceeds potential, there is upward pressure on the inflation rate and vice versa.\n\nThe model features a downward-sloping demand curve (AD) and a horizontal inflation adjustment line (IA). The point where the two lines cross is equal to potential GDP. A shift in either curve will explain the impact on real GDP and inflation in the short run.\n\nThe AD–IA model depends on the assumption of the monetary policy rule (MPR). The monetary policy rule is that the federal reserve increases interest rates in response to increase in inflation and vice versa.\n\nA shift in demand can occur for the following reasons:\n\n\"Example\": Suppose the government were to cut taxes. This would lead to an increase in expenditures and thus an increase in demand. The demand curve would therefore shift to the right and real GDP would be growing above potential. The inflation adjustment line would then shift upward (reflecting an increase in the inflation rate) causing a movement along the new demand curve until real GDP was equal to potential.\n\nThis model is further advanced in higher levels of undergraduate studies.\n\nDavid Romer proposed in 2000 that the LM curve be replaced in the IS–LM model. Instead, Romer suggested that although the Federal Reserve uses open market operations to impact the federal funds rate, they are not targeting money supply, but rather the interest rate. Therefore, he suggests removing the LM curve and replacing it with the MP curve.\n\n\n"}

The four ashramas are: \"Brahmacharya\" (student), \"Grihastha\" (householder), \"Vanaprastha\" (retired) and \"Sannyasa\" (renunciate).\n\nThe \"Ashrama\" system is one facet of the \"Dharma\" concept in Hinduism. It is also a component of the ethical theories in Indian philosophy, where it is combined with four proper goals of human life (\"Purusartha\"), for fulfilment, happiness and spiritual liberation.\n\nUnder the Ashram system, the human lifespan was divided into four periods. The goal of each period was the fulfilment and development of the individual. The classical system, in the \"Ashrama Upanishad\", the \"Vaikhanasa Dharmasutra\" and the later \"Dharmashastra\", presents these as sequential stages of human life and recommends ages for entry to each stage, while in the original system presented in the early \"Dharmasutras\" the Ashramas were four alternative available ways of life, neither presented as sequential nor with age recommendations.\n\nThe Ashramas system is one facet of the complex Dharma concept in Hinduism. It is integrated with the concept of Purushartha, or four proper aims of life in Hindu philosophy, namely, Dharma (piety, morality, duties), Artha (wealth, health, means of life), Kama (love, relationships, emotions) and Moksha (liberation, freedom, self-realization). Each of the four Ashramas of life are a form of personal and social environment, each stage with ethical guidelines, duties and responsibilities, for the individual and for the society. Each Ashrama stage places different levels of emphasis on the four proper goals of life, with different stages viewed as steps to the attainment of the ideal in Hindu philosophy, namely Moksha.\n\nNeither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three Ashramas must devote itself solely to a specific goal of life (\"Purushartha\"). The fourth stage of \"Sannyasa\" is different, and the overwhelming consensus in ancient and medieval texts is that \"Sannyasa\" stage of life must entirely be devoted to \"Moksha\" aided by \"Dharma\".\n\n\"Dharma\" is held primary for all stages. \"Moksha\" is the ultimate noble goal, recommended for everyone, to be sought at any stage of life. On the other two, the texts are unclear.

Depending on the time period and culture, the term can have several meanings. During the Renaissance time period it was used in a Platonic format to designate the \"aetheric vehicle or starlike garment surrounding the soul which descended from heaven and entered the individual body\". It was thought to be one of the three parts of the human soul that contained the \"thoughts, cogitations, desires, imaginations that were impressed upon the mind at the time of death\" as well as lust and anger. The philosopher Marsilio Ficino considered it to be a link between the physical body and the incorporeal soul while others such as Jean Fernel associated it more with animal spirits. Philosopher Henry More introduced the term into the medical setting and considered the astral spirit to be a part of the body that was separate from the \"rational soul\". More's viewpoint was criticized as \"[reducing] spiritual phenomena ... to pseudo-physical explanations\".\n\nAstral spirits have also been associated with the familiar spirit and witchcraft, specifically black magic, and was considered at one point to be demonic in origin. This definition of astral spirits considered the entities to be completely separate from the concept of the astral spirit as something that was considered to be part of or attached to the human body or soul. The term was also used in relation to the concept of ghosts and vampirism, as spiritualists in the nineteenth century believed that the astral spirit would rise from the grave of the deceased in order to steal the blood and vitality of the living while the physical body would remain in the grave. This form of the astral spirit, while sometimes considered to be harmful, fell into the Platonic definition as it was considered to be a remnant of the deceased in some form. Astral spirits were also considered to be potentially capable of fathering a child, as there were some tales of astral spirits reportedly impregnating the wife of a deceased hajduk.\n"}
{"id": "223063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223063", "title": "Benchmarking", "text": "Benchmarking\n\nBenchmarking is comparing ones business processes and performance metrics to industry bests and best practices from other companies. In project management benchmarking can also support the selection, planning and delivery of projects. Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied (the \"targets\") to one's own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. According to National Council on Measurement in Education, benchmark assessments are short assessments used by teachers at various times throughout the school year to monitor student progress in some area of the school curriculum. These also are known as interim assessments.\n\nBenchmarking is used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.\n\nAlso referred to as \"best practice benchmarking\" or \"process benchmarking\", this process is used in management which particularly shows VEMR strategic management, in which organizations evaluate various aspects of their processes in relation to best practice companies' processes, usually within a peer group defined for the purposes of comparison. This then allows organizations to develop plans on how to make improvements or adapt specific best practices, usually with the aim of increasing some aspect of performance. Benchmarking may be a one-off event, but is often treated as a continuous process in which organizations continually seek to improve their practices.\n\nThe term benchmark, originates from the history of guns and ammunition, and with the same aim as for the business term; comparison and improved performance. The introduction of gunpowder arms replaced the bow and arrow from the archer, the soldier who used the bow. The archer now had to adapt to the new situation, and learn to handle the gun. The new weapon left only a mark on the target, where the arrow used to be visible, and with the bow gone, the soldiers title changed to marksman, the man who put the mark. The gun was improved already in the early beginning, with rifling of the barrel, and the rifle was born. With the industrialization of the weapon-industry in the mid-1800's, The mass production of ammunition as a cartridge replaced the manual loading of black-powder and bullet into the gun. Now, with standardized production of both the high-precision rifle, as well as the cartridge, the marksman was now the uncertain variable, and with different qualities and specifications on both rifle as well as ammunition, there was a need for a method of finding the best combination. The rifled weapon was fixed in a bench, making it possible to fire several identical shots at a target to measure the spread. This is benchmarking, as it is still done today, both at the gun-factory, the ammunition-factory, as well as for a lot of sportsmen who look for the best ammunition to bring to competition. \n\nBenchmarking is most used to measure performance using a specific indicator (cost per unit of measure, productivity per unit of measure, cycle time of x per unit of measure or defects per unit of measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others. In 1994, one of the first technical journal named \"Benchmarking: An International Journal\" was published.\n\nIn 2008, a comprehensive survey on benchmarking was commissioned by The Global Benchmarking Network, a network of benchmarking centres representing 22 countries.\n\n\nThere is no single benchmarking process that has been universally adopted. The wide appeal and acceptance of benchmarking has led to the emergence of benchmarking methodologies. One seminal book is Boxwell's \"Benchmarking for Competitive Advantage\" (1994). The first book on benchmarking, written and published by Kaiser Associates, is a practical guide and offers a seven-step approach. Robert Camp (who wrote one of the earliest books on benchmarking in 1989) developed a 12-stage approach to benchmarking.\n\nThe 12 stage methodology consists of:\n\nThe following is an example of a typical benchmarking methodology:\n\n\nThe three main types of costs in benchmarking are:\n\nThe cost of benchmarking can substantially be reduced through utilizing the many internet resources that have sprung up over the last few years. These aim to capture benchmarks and best practices from organizations, business sectors and countries to make the benchmarking process much quicker and cheaper.\n\nThe technique initially used to compare existing corporate strategies with a view to achieving the best possible performance in new situations (see above), has recently been extended to the comparison of technical products. This process is usually referred to as \"technical benchmarking\" or \"product benchmarking\". Its use is well-developed within the automotive industry (\"automotive benchmarking\"), where it is vital to design products that match precise user expectations, at minimal cost, by applying the best technologies available worldwide. Data is obtained by fully disassembling existing cars and their systems. Such analyses were initially carried out in-house by car makers and their suppliers. However, as these analyses are expensive, they are increasingly being outsourced to companies who specialize in this area. Outsourcing has enabled a drastic decrease in costs for each company (by cost sharing) and the development of efficient tools (standards, software).\n\nBenchmarking can be internal (comparing performance between different groups or teams within an organization) or external (comparing performance with companies in a specific industry or across industries). Within these broader categories, there are three specific types of benchmarking: 1) Process benchmarking, 2) Performance benchmarking and 3) Strategic benchmarking. These can be further detailed as follows:\n\nBenchmarking software can be used to organize large and complex amounts of information. Software packages can extend the concept of benchmarking and competitive analysis by allowing individuals to handle such large and complex amounts or strategies. Such tools support different types of benchmarking (see above) and can reduce the above costs significantly.\n\nThe emerging technology of benchmarking engines automates the stage of going from data to noteworthy comparative insights, sometimes even expressing the insights in English sentences.\n\nAnother approach to making comparisons involves using more aggregative cost or production information to identify strong and weak performing units. The two most common forms of quantitative analysis used in metric benchmarking are data envelope analysis (DEA) and regression analysis. DEA estimates the cost level an efficient firm should be able to achieve in a particular market. In infrastructure regulation, DEA can be used to reward companies/operators whose costs are near the efficient frontier with additional profits. Regression analysis estimates what the average firm should be able to achieve. With regression analysis, firms that performed better than average can be rewarded while firms that performed worse than average can be penalized. Such benchmarking studies are used to create yardstick comparisons, allowing outsiders to evaluate the performance of operators in an industry. Advanced statistical techniques, including stochastic frontier analysis, have been used to identify high and weak performers in industries, including applications to schools, hospitals, water utilities, and electric utilities.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for metric benchmarking is the variety of metric definitions used among companies or divisions. Definitions may change over time within the same organization due to changes in leadership and priorities. The most useful comparisons can be made when metrics definitions are common between compared units and do not change so improvements can be changed\n\n"}

The original concept was proposed in 1993 by US Air Force Captain Mitchell Burnside Clapp, who was familiar with the Air Force's use of aerial refueling to extend the performance of combat aircraft. The concept was further developed by others, including an even smaller concept developed by Robert Zubrin, Black Colt. Clapp left the Air Force in 1996 and partnered with Zubrin to form Pioneer Rocketplane, who proposed a slightly larger version known as Pathfinder. This has since become the Pathfinder XL concept.\n\nClapp proposed Black Horse as a solution to the Air Force's ongoing TransAtmospheric Vehicle (TAV) mission. The concept was picked up by the Phillips Laboratory, and over the winter of 1993-94 they carried out a six-week study with WJ Schafer Associates and Conceptual Research Corporation (an aircraft design firm) into what was now known as the Aerial Propellant Transfer (APT) concept. APT was based on using as many off-the-shelf components as possible and considered a wide variety of possible propellants. Wishing to use only non-cryogenic fuels, they favored the use of conventional JP-5 jet fuel with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer. Other mixes considered, mostly for comparison purposes, were liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX), methane/LOX, and RP-1/LOX. Although the performance of the alternate fuels was higher, they all included at least one cryogenic component and were much less dense. Using peroxide had the additional advantage of cooling the combustion, which allowed the use of conventional JP-5 rather than the more expensive RP-1.\n\nThe study demonstrated that Black Horse would outperform any vertical take-off/horizontal landing concept no matter what fuel it used. The study also noted that the speed that the aerial fuel transfer took place was a key input to the overall performance of the system. Black Horse was deliberately designed to use existing tanker aircraft, specifically the KC-135Q and T models, which had fuel tanks completely separate from the aircraft's own fuel system (most models allowed the 135's engines to draw from the tanks). However, performance was slightly increased if the transfer took place in the supersonic regime at Mach 3.0, and dramatically increased, almost doubled, if it was hypersonic at Mach 5.5.\n\nThe concept was also picked up by Zubrin, who was then working at Martin Marietta, who carried out their own design series from January to May 1994. This developed the smaller Black Colt concept. Clapp and Zubrin later wrote an extensive article on the concepts in the June 1985 edition of \"Analog\" magazine.\n\n\n"}

These smaller DFTs are then combined via size-\"r\" butterflies, which themselves are DFTs of size \"r\" (performed \"m\" times on corresponding outputs of the sub-transforms) pre-multiplied by roots of unity (known as twiddle factors).

It is variously considered a subspecies of the wild boar or a distinct species. The domestic pig's head-plus-body-length ranges from , and the adult can weigh between . The size and weight of a hog largely depends on its breed. Compared to other artiodactyls, its head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. Even-toed ungulates are generally herbivorous, but the domestic pig is an omnivore, like its wild relative.\n\nWhen used as livestock, domestic pigs are farmed primarily for the consumption of their flesh, called pork. The animal's bones, hide, and bristles are also used in commercial products. Domestic pigs, especially miniature breeds, are kept as pets.\n\nThe domestic pig typically has a large head, with a long snout which is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and a disk of cartilage at the tip. The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food, and is a very acute sense organ. The dental formula of adult pigs is , giving a total of 44 teeth. The rear teeth are adapted for crushing. In the male the canine teeth can form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.\n\nFour hoofed toes are on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.\n\nMost domestic pigs have rather a bristled sparse hair covering on their skin, although woolly-coated breeds such as the Mangalitsa exist.\n\nPigs possess both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands, although the latter appear limited to the snout and dorsonasal areas. Pigs, however, like other \"hairless\" mammals (e.g. elephants, rhinos, and mole-rats), do not use thermal sweat glands in cooling. Pigs are also less able than many other mammals to dissipate heat from wet mucous membranes in the mouth through panting. Their thermoneutral zone is 16 to 22 °C. At higher temperatures, pigs lose heat by wallowing in mud or water via evaporative cooling; although it has been suggested that wallowing may serve other functions, such as protection from sunburn, ecto-parasite control, and scent-marking.\n\nPigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.\n\nDomestic pigs have small lungs in relation to their body size, and are thus more susceptible than other domesticated animals to fatal bronchitis and pneumonia.\n\nThe domestic pig is most often considered to be a subspecies of the wild boar, which was given the name \"Sus scrofa\" by Carl Linnaeus in 1758; following from this, the formal name of the domestic pig is \"Sus scrofa domesticus\". However, in 1777, Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben classified the domestic pig as a separate species from the wild boar. He gave it the name \"Sus domesticus\", which is still used by some taxonomists.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BC in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BC in Cyprus. Those animals must have been introduced from the mainland, which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. There was also a separate domestication in China which took place about 8000 years ago.\n\nDNA evidence from subfossil remains of teeth and jawbones of Neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in Europe had been brought from the Near East. This stimulated the domestication of local European wild boar, resulting in a third domestication event with the Near Eastern genes dying out in European pig stock. Modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges, with European domesticated lines being exported, in turn, to the ancient Near East. Historical records indicate that Asian pigs were introduced into Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nIn August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication, which was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals, and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe, where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included a mixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.\n\nThe adaptable nature and omnivorous diet of the wild boar allowed early humans to domesticate it readily. Pigs were mostly used for food, but early civilizations also used the pigs' hides for shields, bones for tools and weapons, and bristles for brushes. In India, pigs have been domesticated for a long time, mostly in Goa and some rural areas, for pig toilets. Though ecologically logical as well as economical, pig toilets are waning in popularity as use of septic tanks and sewage systems is increasing in rural areas.\n\nAmong the animals that the Spanish introduced to the Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, pigs were the most successful to adapt. The pigs benefited from abundant shellfish and algae exposed by the large tides of the archipelago. Pigs were brought to southeastern North America from Europe by de Soto and other early Spanish explorers. Escaped pigs became feral and caused a great deal of disruption to Native Americans, who had no domesticated animals, with the exception of dogs.\nFeral pig populations in the southeastern United States have since migrated north and are a growing concern in the Midwest. Considered an invasive species, many state agencies have programs to trap or hunt feral pigs as means of removal. Domestic pigs have become feral in many other parts of the world (e.g. New Zealand and northern Queensland) and have caused substantial environmental damage. Feral hybrids of the European wild boar with the domestic pig are also very disruptive to both environment and agriculture (among the 100 most damaging animal species), especially in southeastern South America from Uruguay to Brazil's Mato Grosso do Sul (Center-West Region), and São Paulo (state) (Southeast Region), where they are known as (from \"javali\" and \"porco\", thus \"boar-pigs\").\n\nWith around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domesticated pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.\n\nFemale pigs reach sexual maturity at 3–12 months of age, and come into estrus every 18–24 days if they are not successfully bred. The gestation period averages 112–120 days. Estrus lasts two to three days, and the female's displayed receptiveness to mate is known as standing heat. Standing heat is a reflexive response that is stimulated when the female is in contact with the saliva of a sexually mature boar. Androstenol is one of the pheromones produced in the submaxillary salivary glands of boars that will trigger the female's response. The female cervix contains a series of five interdigitating pads, or folds, that will hold the boar's corkscrew-shaped penis during copulation. Females have bicornuate uteruses and two conceptuses must be present in both uterine horns for pregnancy to be established. Maternal recognition of pregnancy in pigs occurs on days 11 to 12 of the pregnancy.\n\nIn many ways, their behaviour appears to be intermediate between that of other artiodactyls and of carnivores. Domestic pigs seek out the company of other pigs, and often huddle to maintain physical contact, although they do not naturally form large herds. They typically live in groups of about 8-10 adult sows, some young individuals, and some single males.\n\nBecause of their relative lack of sweat glands, pigs often control their body temperature using behavioural thermoregulation. Wallowing, which often consists of coating the body with mud, is a behaviour frequently exhibited by pigs. They do not submerge completely under the mud, but vary the depth and duration of wallowing depending on environmental conditions. Typically, adult pigs start wallowing once the ambient temperature is around 17-21 °C. They cover themselves from head to toe in mud. Pigs may use mud as a sunscreen, or as a method of keeping parasites away. Most bristled pigs will \"blow their coat\", meaning that they shed most of the longer, more-coarse stiff hair once a year, usually in Spring or early Summer, to prepare for the warmer months ahead.\n\nIf conditions permit, domestic pigs feed continuously for many hours and then sleep for many hours, in contrast to ruminants which tend to feed for a short time and then sleep for a short time. Pigs are omnivorous, and are highly versatile in their feeding behaviour. As they are foraging animals, they primarily eat leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and flowers. Domestic pigs are highly intelligent animals, and according to David DiSalvo's writing in \"Forbes\", they are \"widely considered the smartest domesticated animal in the world. Pigs can move a cursor on a video screen with their snouts and even learn to distinguish between the scribbles they knew from those they saw for the first time.\"\n\nRooting is an instinctual behavior in pigs that is characterized by a pig nudging its snout into something. Similar to a cat’s kneading, rooting is found comforting, first happens when they are born in order to obtain their mother’s milk, and can become a habitual, obsessive behavior which is most prominent in animals weaned too early. Often, pigs will root and dig into the ground to forage for food. Rooting is known to also be used as a means of communication.\n\nA pig may be chosen to have a nose ring pierced through its septum, as this discourages rooting as it is painful to the pig. Piercing through the rim of the nose is even more painful, as in this area, there are many more free nerve endings.\n\nThe breed known as the kunekune hardly ever roots, as it sustains itself feeding on nothing more but grass leaves. Not having to root around in the soil to find underground food (e.g. tubers), it thus has evolved to, for the most part, not possess these instincts.\n\nA behavioural characteristic of domestic pigs which they share with carnivores is nest-building. Sows root in the ground to create depressions and then build nests in which to give birth. First, the sow digs a depression about the size of her body. She then collects twigs, grasses and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound. She distributes the softer, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet. When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface. She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material. She then gives birth in a lying position, which, again, is different from other artiodactyls, which usually give birth in a standing position.\n\nNest-building behaviour is an important part in the process of pre and post-partum maternal behaviour. Nest-building will occur during the last 24 hours before the onset of farrowing, and becomes most intense during 12 to 6 hours before farrowing. Nest-building is divided into two phases: one of which is the initial phase of rooting in ground while the second phase is the collecting, carrying and arranging of the nest material. The sow will separate from the group and seek a suitable nest site with some shelter from rain and wind that has well-drained soil. This nest-building behaviour is performed to provide the offspring with shelter, comfort, and thermoregulation. The nest will provide protection against weather and predators, while keeping the piglets close to the sow and away from the rest of the herd. This ensures they do not get trampled on and that other piglets are not stealing milk from the sow. Nest-building can be influenced by internal and external stimuli. Internal hormonal changes and the completion of one nesting phase are indicators of this maternal behaviour. The onset is triggered by the rise in prolactin levels, which is caused by a decrease in progesterone and an increase in prostaglandin, while the gathering of the nest material seems to be regulated more by external stimuli such as temperature. The longer time spent on nest-building will increase pre-partum oxytocin.\n\nCompared to most other mammals, pigs display complex nursing and suckling behaviour. Nursing occurs every 50–60 minutes, and the sow requires stimulation from piglets before milk let-down. Sensory inputs (vocalisation, odours from mammary and birth fluids and hair patterns of the sow) are particularly important immediately post-birth to facilitate teat location by the piglets. Initially, the piglets compete for position at the udder, then each piglet massages around its respective teat with its snout, during which time the sow grunts at slow, regular intervals. Each series of grunts varies in frequency, tone and magnitude, indicating the stages of nursing to the piglets.\n\nThe phase of competition for teats and of nosing the udder lasts for about one minute, and ends when milk flow begins. In the third phase, the piglets hold the teats in their mouths and suck with slow mouth movements (one per second), and the rate of the sow’s grunting increases for approximately 20 seconds. The grunt peak in the third phase of suckling does not coincide with milk ejection, but rather the release of oxytocin from the pituitary into the bloodstream. Phase four coincides with the period of main milk flow (10–20 seconds) when the piglets suddenly withdraw slightly from the udder and start sucking with rapid mouth movements of about three per second. The sow grunts rapidly, lower in tone and often in quick runs of three or four, during this phase. Finally, the flow stops and so does the grunting of the sow. The piglets may then dart from teat to teat and recommence suckling with slow movements, or nosing the udder. Piglets massage and suckle the sow’s teats after milk flow ceases as a way of letting the sow know their nutritional status. This helps her to regulate the amount of milk released from that teat in future sucklings. The more intense the post-feed massaging of a teat, the greater the future milk release from that teat will be.\n\nIn pigs, dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. Domestic piglets are highly precocious and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats. Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing milk letdown, so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.\nUsing an artificial sow to rear groups of piglets, recognition of a teat in a particular area of the udder depended initially on visual orientation by means of reference points on the udder to find the area, and then the olfactory sense for the more accurate search within that area.\n\nPigs have panoramic vision of approximately 310° and binocular vision of 35° to 50°. It is thought they have no eye accommodation. Other animals that have no accommodation, e.g. sheep, lift their heads to see distant objects. The extent to which pigs have colour vision is still a source of some debate; however, the presence of cone cells in the retina with two distinct wavelength sensitivities (blue and green) suggests that at least some colour vision is present.\n\nPigs have a well-developed sense of smell, and use is made of this in Europe where they are trained to locate underground truffles. Olfactory rather than visual stimuli are used in the identification of other pigs. Hearing is also well developed, and localisation of sounds is made by moving the head. Pigs use auditory stimuli extensively as a means of communication in all social activities. Alarm or aversive stimuli are transmitted to other pigs not only by auditory cues but also by pheromones. Similarly, recognition between the sow and her piglets is by olfactory and vocal cues.\n\nMany breeds of domestic pig exist; in many colors, shapes, and sizes. According to The Livestock Conservancy, as of 2016, three breeds of domestic pig are critically rare (having a global population of fewer than 2000). They are the Choctaw hog, the Mulefoot, and the Ossabaw Island pig. The known smallest domestic pig breed in the world is the Göttingen minipig, typically weighing about as a healthy, full-grown adult.\n\nWhen in use as livestock, the domestic pig is mostly farmed for its meat, pork. Other food products made from pigs include pork sausage (which includes casings that are made from the intestines), bacon, gammon, ham and pork rinds. The head of a pig can be used to make a preserved jelly called head cheese, which is sometimes known as brawn. Liver, chitterlings, blood (for black pudding), and other offal from pigs are also widely used for food. In some religions, such as Judaism and Islam, pork is a taboo food.\n\nThe use of pig milk for human consumption does take place, but as there are certain difficulties in obtaining it, there is little commercial production.\n\nLivestock pigs are exhibited at agricultural shows, judged either as stud stock compared to the standard features of each pig breed, or in commercial classes where the animals are judged primarily on their suitability for slaughter to provide premium meat.\n\nThe skin of pigs is used to produce seat covers, apparel, pork rinds, and other items.\n\nIn some developing and developed nations, the domestic pig is usually raised outdoors in yards or fields. In some areas, pigs are allowed to forage in woods where they may be taken care of by swineherds. In industrialized nations such as the United States, domestic pig farming has switched from the traditional pig farm to large-scale intensive pig farms. This has resulted in lower production costs, but can cause significant cruelty problems, and demand for pasture-raised pork in the United States has increased as consumers become concerned with humane treatment of livestock.\n\nVietnamese pot-bellied pigs, a small breed of domestic pig, have made popular pets in the United States beginning in the latter half of the twentieth century.\n\nThey were soon crossbred with a variety of other smaller breeds (such as the Göttingen minipig), with separate locations breeding different lineages. These miniature pigs soon gained attention, even more so than the original Vietnamese pot-bellied. As a result of this, many pet pigs are now of unknown genetic descent.\n\nDomestic pigs are highly intelligent, social creatures. They are considered hypoallergenic, and are known to do quite well with people who have usual animal allergies. Since these animals are known to have a life expectancy of 15 to 20 years, they require long-term commitment.\n\nUn-neutered male and female swine may express unwanted, aggressive behavior, and are prone to developing serious health issues. Regular trimming of the hooves is necessary; hooves left untreated cause major pain in the pig, can create malformations in bone structure, and may cause it to be more susceptible to fungal growth between crevices of the hoof. As prey animals, natural behavior causes pigs to have a strong fear of being picked up, but they will usually calm down once placed back onto the ground. When holding the pig, supporting it under the legs is not as stressful for the animal. Pigs need enrichment activities to keep their intelligent minds occupied; if pigs get bored, they often get destructive. As rooting is found to be comforting, pigs kept in the house may root in household objects, and as such, should have a box with rocks, soil, straw, and/or other material for them to root in instead.\n\nThe domestic pig, both as a live animal and source of post-mortem tissues, is one of the most valuable animal models used in biomedical research today, because of its biological, physiological and anatomical similarities to human beings. For instance, human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore pig skin has been used in many preclinical studies. Porcine are used in finding treatments, cures for diseases, xenotransplantation, and for general education. They are also used in the development of medical instruments and devices, surgical techniques and instrumentation, and FDA-approved research. As part of animal conservation (The Three Rs (animals)), these animals contribute to the reduction methods for animal research, as they supply more information from fewer animals used, for a lower cost.\n\nPigs are currently thought to be the best non-human candidates for organ donation to humans. The risk of cross-species disease transmission is decreased because of their increased phylogenetic distance from humans. They are readily available, their organs are anatomically comparable in size, and new infectious agents are less likely since they have been in close contact with humans through domestication for many generations.\n\nTo date, no xenotransplantation trials have been entirely successful due to obstacles arising from the response of the recipient’s immune system—generally more extreme than in allotransplantations, ultimately results in rejection of the xenograft, and in some cases result in the death of the recipient—including hyperacute rejection, acute vascular rejection, cellular rejection and chronic rejection. An early major breakthrough was the 1,3 galactosyl transferase gene knockout.\n\nExamples of viruses carried by pigs include porcine herpesvirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, and circovirus. Of particular concern are PERVs (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.\n\nPig cells have been engineered to inactivate all 62 PERVs in the genome using CRISPR Cas9 genome editing technology, and eliminated infection from the pig to human cells in culture.\n\nBecause the domestic pig is a major domesticated animal, English has many terms unique to the species:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The difference between the two can arise from architecture and run-time dependent factors, e.g. programmed delays or waiting for system resources to become available. Consider the example of a mathematical program that reports that it has used \"CPU time 0m0.04s, Wall time 6m6.01s\". This means that while the program was active for six minutes and six seconds, during that time the computer's processor spent only 4/100 of a second performing calculations for the program.\n\nConversely, programs running in parallel on more than one processing unit can spend CPU time many times beyond their elapsed time.

At least six, and up to 70 young men were kidnapped, tortured and murdered in Baghdad & Iraq during March 2012. In September 2012, BBC News reported that gay men in Baghdad say the killings had not abated.\n\nThe emo subculture gained popularity among Iraqi teens in 2011. Earlier, it had become popular in other Arab countries. Emo, an offshoot of hardcore punk music, is associated in most of the world with teen fashion and alienation, but in the Arab world is also strongly associated with homosexuality. In 2009, Saudi Arabia's religious police arrested 10 emo women for allegedly causing a disturbance in a coffee shop, and in 2008, conservative Egyptians criticized emo fashion-followers in Cairo for being \"disciples of Satan and homosexuals.\" Homosexuality is not illegal in Iraq but it is taboo, and many LGBT (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender) people in Iraq are discriminated against, abused or murdered. Activists say anti-gay harassment has increased since the invasion of Iraq and subsequent Iraq War, with gay Iraqis being bullied and harassed by security forces and beaten and killed by reactionary Islamist paramilitary groups in heavily Shiite areas of Baghdad since at least 2006.\n\nIn February 2012, the Baghdad Morality Police published a statement on the Iraqi Interior Ministry website criticizing emo teens for wearing \"strange, tight clothes with pictures of skulls on them,\" and \"rings in their noses and tongues.\" The statement condemned emo as Satanic, and quoted Colonel Mushtaq Taleb al-Mahemdawi as saying the Morality Police had been given official approval by the Interior Ministry \"to eliminate [the phenomenon] as soon as possible since it's detrimentally affecting the society and becoming a danger.\" The \"New York Times\" reported that in the weeks following, anti-emo flyers, threatening death \"unless gay men cut their hair, stopped wearing the clothing of devil worshippers and stopped listening to metal, emo and rap music\", began appearing in neighbourhoods across Baghdad.\n\nInterior Ministry security officers say the number of dead is six. However, the Reuters news agency reported that hospital and security officials put the number at 14 or more, and human rights groups such as the Brussells Tribunal said the dead number as many as 100. The Associated Press reported that an unnamed Interior Ministry official put the number at 58, and said all but one were male. According to the BBC, the United Nations puts the number of dead at at least 12, but believes the real number is much higher.\n\nThe dead were found in dumpsters, after having been beaten to death with cement blocks in a practice known as \"death by blocking\" or \"mawt al-blokkah\". A person who told the Beirut-based newspaper \"Al Akhbar\" that he had escaped an attack said that, \"first they throw concrete blocks at the boy's arms, then at his legs, then the final blow is to his head, and if he is not dead then, they start all over again.\"\n\nInternational human rights groups have called on Iraqi authorities to investigate the killings, saying they are the work of paramilitary groups and the police, including groups such as the Mahdi Army, created in 2003 by popular Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Iraqi commentators and American professor of Middle Eastern history Mark Levine have speculated that deploying paramilitary groups against emo kids serves Iraqi authorities' interests by keeping the groups occupied, and deflecting their anger and unhappiness from other possible targets in chaotic post-war Iraq. Iraqi television network Al Sumaria reported that Sadr denied responsibility for the deaths, calling the emo teens fools and unnatural but saying they should be dealt with through legal means.\n\nFollowing coverage of the murders, Iraqi officials denied there is any campaign to kill gay or emo teenagers, and said the story has been made up to serve anti-religious, anti-government agendas. They say emo teens can dress as they please, and that the government will protect them.\n\nIn September 2012, the BBC interviewed 17 gay men and former policemen in Baghdad, all of whom had friends or boyfriends killed, and reported that all blamed the Iraqi Interior Ministry for inciting the murders, and said arrests and killings are still ongoing.\n\nIn May 2012 as a result of the emo killings, according to the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, the Dutch government \"expanded\" its asylum policy towards LGBT Iraqis. \n\nThe U.S. State department's 2013 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Iraq reported that in 2013, Iraq's Council of Ministers established an inter-ministerial committee that issued a statement saying LGBT people are \"no different\" from others, and that established a charter to describe the baseline protection owed to them.\n\nIsraeli intelligence analyst Daniel Brode claims the murders are part of an overall shift inside the Iraqi Shiite-Arab population towards becoming \"more religious, more conservative and more assertive,\" with the goal of consolidating its own power by creating a \"fundamentalist Shiite government.\"\n\nBefore the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, sexual minorities there enjoyed a fair amount of freedom. But the invasion brought to power the conservative Islamic Dawa Party, and Human Rights Watch says that since 2004, hundreds of Iraqi gay men have been killed. The campaign has been said to be led by the Mahdi Army, with Iraqi security forces said to have \"colluded and joined in the killing.\" Witnesses told Human Rights Watch the killers break into houses and pick up people in the street, interrogating them to extract the names of other victims, and then kill them and mutilate their bodies.\n\nBy 2007, according to the London-based human rights organization Iraqi LGBT, Iraqi political and religious organizations had launched an organised, coordinated campaign to hunt, arrest, torture and kill everyone they perceived as gay. Iraqi LGBT says the Iraqi government forces gay people to give names and addresses of other gays, then arrests them and hands them over to paramilitary groups to be murdered.\n\nIn \"The Guardian\" newspaper, American human rights activist Scott Long described Iraq as \"a devastated society with a broken political process and a fractured public\" and said \"it's not just wrong, it's counterproductive to call these murders \"gay killings.\"\" He called on Iraq to begin a debate about difference, saying \"Iraqis need to discuss why the horrors of the last four decades have made otherness seem intolerable.\"\n"}

Although the idea failed to gain widespread support for the Union Movement, it nonetheless proved highly influential on the far-right thought in Europe.\n\nThe idea of a united Europe began to develop in the final days of the Second World War. Concepts such as \"Nation Europa\" and \"Eurafrika\", both of which looked for an ever-closer union between European countries, gained some currency in the German far-right underground in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. Mosley, who towards the end of the war had learned to read the German language, read a number of pamphlets discussing these ideas and was strongly influenced by them. Another important influence was Benito Mussolini's manifesto of the Italian Social Republic, which included a call for the establishment of a European Community.\n\nFor his part, Mosley would later claim that he had first advocated something akin to Europe a Nation in speeches as early as 1936. It was not, however, British Union of Fascists policy at any time.\n\nMosley first presented his idea of Europe forming a single state in his book \"The Alternative\" in 1947. He argued that the traditional vision of nationalism that had been followed by the various shades of pre-war fascism had been too narrow in scope and that the post-war era required a new paradigm in which Europe would come together as a single state. He rejected any notion of a federal Europe, instead calling for full integration. Indeed, Mosley insisted that a supranational European state was essential to the plan. The policy was presented to the wider electorate in October 1948 when Mosley called for elections to a European Assembly as the first step towards his vision.\n\nThe notion also had an important geopolitical dimension as Mosley saw it as the only defence against Europe becoming the scene of the power struggles between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War. He contended that the racial kinship between the Germanic peoples of Europe, whom he defined as the Germans, British, Scandinavians and northern French, would be the basis for unity, whilst also declaring his admiration for the contributions of the Latin peoples to Europe's cultural history.\n\nHe was opposed to both the United Nations and its predecessor the League of Nations, dismissing both as part of a Jewish plot to undermine nationalism. As such, Europe a Nation was to include an anti-Semitic dimension, with the entire Jewish population of Europe to be expelled to Palestine, where they could decide their own fate.\n\nAfrica, most of which was still in the hands of the European colonial empires, was to be retained by the united Europe as a giant colony, with apartheid implemented on a continental basis, effectively excluding Blacks from Europe. Notions of any indigenous rule in Africa were excluded altogether from the idea. With autarky a central aim of Europe a Nation, Africa was to be exploited by the new state for its mineral and food resources. In this aspect, Mosley was heavily influenced by the works of Anton Zischka.\n\nMosley subsequently built upon the policy by calling for the European state to have its prices and incomes regulated by a \"wage price mechanism\", whilst also calling for \"European Socialism\", a syndical style organisation basis for the continent's industry. Effectively though the vision he presented was one that was highly steeped in corporatism and elitism. Elections were to be corporatist in nature with an occupation-based franchise (previously a British Union of Fascists policy) whilst \"European Socialism\" was to include an effective free hand for business leaders but the co-ordination of workers in bodies called \"labour Charters\", a policy borrowed from the Fascist Italy.\n\nMosley summed up the arguments himself by stating that 'no lesser degree of union than that of an integral nation can give the will and power to act on the great scale... No lesser space than all Europe, and the overseas possessions of Europe in a common pool, can give the room within which to act effectively'. However Europe a Nation drew heavily on the existing heritage of fascism and indeed Graham Macklin has argued that it \"merely adapted and enlarged the parameters of his fascist panacea to suit the times, and is thus easily recognisable as 'Fascist'\".\n\nWithin the UK, the notion of Europe a Nation largely failed to attract the younger far-right activists, most of whom deserted Mosley in favour of the League of Empire Loyalists (LEL) and other more minor and more extreme groups. A.K. Chesterton, who went on to lead the LEL, was a strong critic of Europe a Nation from 1947 when \"The Alternative\" was first published, preferring to emphasise British nationalism.\n\nThe policy also failed to capture the minds of the British electorate, with the Union Movement enjoying comparative success in voting terms only when they emphasised more basic anti-immigrant rhetoric. Even Alexander Raven Thomson, one of Mosley's closest lieutenants and noted for his sycophantic attitudes towards his leader, eventually told Mosley in 1950 that Europe a Nation held little attraction to British voters. As a consequence, the Union Movement briefly downplayed the idea, although Thomson's preferred alternative, neo-Nazism, was soon abandoned as well when it proved equally unpalatable to the electorate.\n\nWithin the wider European far-right, however, Europe a Nation did gain some wider currency. Fritz Rössler, at the time going by the alias Dr. Franz Richter, became an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and attempted to make it Deutsche Reichspartei policy. He failed in this attempt and was expelled from the party, decamping to the Socialist Reich Party instead. For a time it also had the support of Adolf von Thadden, who helped Mosley to organise the National Party of Europe, a largely failed attempt to build a continental Europe a Nation political party. Ultimately however the plan's main supporter in Germany proved to be Arthur Erhardt, who established the journal \"Nation Europa\" to support far-right pan-European nationalist ideas, to which Mosley was a frequent contributor.\n\nOutside Germany it also gained some currency within the Italian Social Movement, although by the early 1950s that wing of the party lost influence, the Italian nationalist arm gaining supremacy. Similar ideas would later be developed by Jean-François Thiriart and others interested in Europeanism whilst Europe a Nation was also an important influence on the thinking of Alain de Benoist and in particular the work of the think tank \"Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne\" which he established in 1968.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49812451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49812451", "title": "Extended Mathematical Programming (EMP)", "text": "Extended Mathematical Programming (EMP)\n\nAlgebraic modeling languages like AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, MPL and others have been developed to facilitate the description of a problem in mathematical terms and to link the abstract formulation with data-management systems on the one hand and appropriate algorithms for solution on the other. Robust algorithms and modeling language interfaces have been developed for a large variety of mathematical programming problems such as Linear Programs (LPs), Nonlinear Programs (NPs), Mixed Integer Programs (MIPs), Mixed Complementarity Programs (MCPs) and others. Researchers are constantly updating the types of problems and algorithms that they wish to use to model in specific domain applications.\n\nExtended Mathematical Programming (EMP) is an extension to algebraic modeling languages that facilitates the automatic reformulation of new model types by converting the EMP model into established mathematical programming classes to solve by mature solver algorithms. A number of important problem classes can be solved. Specific examples are Variational Inequalities, Nash Equilibria, Disjunctive Programs and Stochastic Programs.\n\nEMP is independent of the modeling language used but currently it is implemented only in GAMS. The new types of problems modeled with EMP are reformulated with the GAMS solver JAMS to well established types of problems and the reformulated models are passed to a suitable GAMS solver to be solved. The core of EMP is a file called emp.info where the annotations that are needed for the reformulations are added to the model.\n\nEquilibrium problems model questions arising in the study of economic equilibria in a mathematically abstract form. Equilibrium problems include Variational Inequalities, problems with Nash Equilibria, and Multiple Optimization Problems with Equilibrium Constraints (MOPECs). Use EMP's keywords to reformulate these problems as Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCPs), a class of problems for which mature solver technology exists. Solve the newly reformulated EMP keyword version of the problem with the PATH solver or other GAMS MCP solvers.\n\nExamples of the use of EMP to solve equilibrium problems include the computation of Cournot-Nash-Walras equilibria.., modeling water allocation, long-term planning of transmission line expansion of the electrical grid, modeling risk-averse agents in hydro-thermal electricity markets with uncertain inflows into hydro reservoirs and modeling Variational Inequalities in energy markets \n\nHierarchical optimization problems are mathematical programs with an additional optimization problem in their constraints. A simple example is the bilevel programming problem that optimizes an upper level objective over constraints that include another lower level optimization problem. Bilevel programming is used in many areas. One example is the design of optimal tax instruments. The tax instrument is modeled in the upper level and the clearing market is modeled in the lower level. In general, \nthe lower level problem may be an optimization problem or a Variational Inequality. Several keywords are provided to facilitate reformulating hierarchical optimization problems. Bilevel optimization problems modeled with EMP are reformulated to Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) and then they are solved with one of the GAMS MPEC solvers (NLPEC or KNITRO).\n\nMathematical programs involving binary variables and disjunction definitions for modeling discrete choices are called disjunctive programs. Disjunctive programs have many applications, including ordering of tasks in a production process, organizing complex projects in a time saving manner and choosing the optimal route in a circuit. Procedures for linear and nonlinear disjunctive programming extensions are implemented within EMP. Linear disjunctive programs are reformulated as mixed integer programs (MIPs) and nonlinear disjunctive programs are reformulated as mixed integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). They are solved with the solver LogMIP 2.0 and possibly other GAMS subsolvers.\n\nExamples of the use of EMP for disjunctive programming include scheduling problems in the chemical industry\n\nEMP SP is the stochastic extension of the EMP framework. A deterministic model with fixed parameters is transformed into a stochastic model where some of the parameters are not fixed but are represented by probability distributions. This is done with annotations and specific keywords. Single and joint discrete and parametric probability distributions are possible. In addition, there are keywords for the Expected Value, Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Variables that are risk measures can feature in the objective equation or in constraints. EMP SP facilitates the optimization of a single risk measure or a combination of risk measures (for example, the weighted sum of Expected Value and CVaR). In addition, the modeler can choose to trade off risk measures. It is also possible to model constraints that only hold with certain probabilities (chance constraints). Currently, the following GAMS solvers can be used with EMP SP: DE, DECIS, JAMS and LINDO. Any GAMS solver can be used to process the pre-sampled deterministic equivalent problem.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21438636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21438636", "title": "Gaze", "text": "Gaze\n\nIn critical theory, sociology, and psychoanalysis, the gaze (translated from French \"le regard\") is the act of seeing and being seen.\n\nNumerous existentialists and phenomenologists have addressed the concept of gaze beginning with Jean-Paul Sartre. Foucault elaborated on gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his \"Discipline and Punish\". Derrida also elaborated on the relations of animals and humans via the gaze in \"The Animal That Therefore I Am\". The concept of a male gaze was originally theorized by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, and has since been applied to many other forms of media and technology, such as advertisements, the work space, and video games.\n\nIn Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, it is the anxious state that comes with the awareness that one can be viewed. The psychological effect, Lacan argues, is that the subject loses a degree of autonomy upon realizing that he or she is a visible object. This concept is bound with his theory of the mirror stage, in which a child encountering a mirror realizes that he or she has an external appearance. Lacan suggests that this gaze effect can similarly be produced by any conceivable object such as a chair or a television screen. This is not to say that the object behaves optically as a mirror; instead it means that the awareness of any object can induce an awareness of also \"being\" an object.\n\nIt has also been called an aspect of one of the \"most powerful human forces\"; that is, \"the meeting of the face and the gaze\" because \"Only there do we exist for one another.\"\n\nMichel Foucault first used the term \"medical gaze\" in \"The Birth of the Clinic\" to explain the process of medical diagnosis, power dynamics between doctors and patients, and the hegemony of medical knowledge in society. He elaborated on the gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his \"Discipline and Punish\", such as surveillance and the function of related disciplinary mechanisms and self-regulation in a prison or school as an apparatus of power.\n\nThe gaze is not something one has or uses; rather, it is the relationship into which someone enters. As Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright write in \"Practices of Looking\", \"The gaze is integral to systems of power and ideas about knowledge.\" Three main concepts that Foucault introduced are panopticism, power/knowledge, and biopower. These concepts all address self-regulation under systems of surveillance. This refers to how people modify their behaviour under the belief that they are constantly being watched even if they cannot directly see who or what is watching them. This possible surveillance, whether real or unreal, has self-regulating effects.\n\nIn her 1975 essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\", Laura Mulvey introduced the second-wave feminist concept of \"male gaze\" as a feature of gender power asymmetry in film. The concept was present in earlier studies of the gaze, but it was Mulvey who brought it to the forefront. Mulvey stated that women were objectified in film because heterosexual men were in control of the camera. Hollywood films played to the models of voyeurism and scopophilia. The concept has subsequently been influential in feminist film theory and media studies.\n\nIn Judith Butler's 1990 book \"Gender Trouble\", she proposed the idea of the feminine gaze as a way in which men choose to perform their masculinity by using women as the ones who force men into self-regulation.\n\nE. Ann Kaplan has introduced the post-colonial concept of the imperial gaze, in which the observed find themselves defined in terms of the privileged observer's own set of value-preferences. From the perspective of the colonised, the imperial gaze infantilizes and trivializes what it falls upon, asserting its command and ordering function as it does so.\n\nKaplan comments: \"The imperial gaze reflects the assumption that the white western subject is central much as the male gaze assumes the centrality of the male subject.\"\n\nIn her 1992 essay titled \"The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship\", bell hooks counters Laura Mulvey's notion of the (male) gaze by introducing the oppositional gaze of Black women. This concept exists as the reciprocal of the normative white spectator gaze. As Mulvey's essay contextualizes the (male) gaze and its objectification of white women, hooks essay opens \"oppositionality [as] a key paradigm in the feminist analysis of the 'gaze' and of scopophilic regimes in Western culture\".\n\nThe oppositional gaze remains a critique of rebellion due to the sustained and deliberate misrepresentation of Black women in cinema as characteristically Mammy, Jezebel or Sapphire.\n\nFirst referred to by Edward Said as \"orientalism\", the term \"post-colonial gaze\" is used to explain the relationship that colonial powers extended to people of colonized countries. Placing the colonized in a position of the \"other\" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea. The postcolonial gaze \"has the function of establishing the subject/object relationship ... it indicates at its point of emanation the location of the subject, and at its point of contact the location of the object\". In essence, this means that the colonizer/colonized relationship provided the basis for the colonizer's understanding of themselves and their identity. The role of the appropriation of power is central to understanding how colonizers influenced the countries that they colonized, and is deeply connected to the development of post-colonial theory. Utilizing postcolonial gaze theory allows formerly colonized societies to overcome the socially constructed barriers that often prohibit them from expressing their true cultural, social, economic, and political rights.\nThe international gaze\nThe international gaze is the term used to describe the Neo Liberal and globalising manifestation of the imperial,- / post-colonial gaze. Both latter terms are helpful in defining the dominated status of developing countries. However, the international gaze offers a way of understanding how internationalism, seemingly neutral and optimistic in outlook, is deeply rooted in a discourse of advantage and power. It inculcates an implicit assumption of dominance by those empowered to be international, whilst obviating the innate power relations. This term is first used by A. Gardner-McTaggart (2018) in \"International Capital, International Schools, Leadership and Christianity\nThe male tourist gaze\n\nThe tourism image is created through cultural and ideological constructions and advertising agencies that have been male dominated. What is represented by the media assumes a specific type of tourist: white, Western, male, and heterosexual, privileging the gaze of the \"master subject\" over others. This is the representation of the typical tourist because those behind the lens, the image, and creators are predominantly male, white, and Western. Those that do not fall into this category are influenced by its supremacy. Through these influences female characteristics such as youth, beauty, sexuality, or the possession of a man are desirable while the prevalence of stereotypes consisting of submissive and sensual women with powerful \"macho\" men in advertising are projected.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1915636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1915636", "title": "Identity crisis", "text": "Identity crisis\n\nIn psychology, the term identity crisis means the failure to achieve ego identity during adolescence. The term was coined by German psychologist Erik Erikson.\n\nThe stage of psychosocial development in which identity crisis may occur is called the Identity Cohesion vs. Role Confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them. Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's progress through previous developmental stages, centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative.\n\nErikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born Ashkenazic Jewish, Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the Yurok of northern California and the Sioux of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion.\n\nSometimes individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to \"find themselves\". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. \n\nErikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually \"redistrict\" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is fidelity, which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people.\n\nHe described identity as \"a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given — that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals — with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters.\"\n\nJames Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also apply to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents.\n\nIdentity foreclosure is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice. \"The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question\". Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the \"security blanket\" of their assumed identity is removed. These \"foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed.\" An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news.\n\nIdentity diffusion is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents. Identity diffusion can be described as \"the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment\". Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure. An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes recluse after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury.\n\nIdentity moratorium is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as \"the active exploration of alternatives\". Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity. An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion.\n\nIdentity achievement is the resolution to many identity crises. Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18496314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18496314", "title": "Inalienable possessions", "text": "Inalienable possessions\n\nInalienable possessions (or immovable property) are things such as land or objects that are symbolically identified with the groups that own them and so cannot be permanently severed from them. Landed estates in the Middle Ages, for example, had to remain intact and even if sold, they could be reclaimed by blood kin. As a legal classification, inalienable possessions date back to Roman times. According to Barbara Mills, \"Inalienable possessions are objects made to be kept (not exchanged), have symbolic and economic power that cannot be transferred, and are often used to authenticate the ritual authority of corporate groups\". \n\nMarcel Mauss first described inalienable possessions in \"The Gift\", discussing potlatches, a kind of gift-giving feast held in communities of many indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest:\nIt is even incorrect to speak in these cases of transfer. They are loans rather than sales or true abandonment of possessions. Among the Kwakiutl a certain number of objects, although they appear at the potlatch, cannot be disposed of. In reality these pieces of \"property\" are sacra that a family divests itself of only with great reluctance and sometimes never.\nAnnette Weiner broadened the application of the category of property outside the European context with her book \"Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving\", focussing on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea and testing existing theories of reciprocity and marriage exchange. She also applies the concept to explain examples such as the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands, which was made famous by Bronisław Malinowski. She explores how such possessions enable hierarchy by establishing a source of lasting social difference. She also describes practices of loaning inalienable possessions as a way of either \"temporarily making kin of non-kin\" or garnering status.\n\n\"Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving\" is a book by anthropologist Annette Weiner. Weiner was a Professor of Anthropology and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts at New York University, and served as president of the American Anthropological Association. She died in 1997.\n\nThe book focuses on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea to test existing theories of reciprocity (gift-giving) and marriage exchange. The book is also important for introducing a consideration of gender in the gift-giving debate by placing women at the heart of the political process. She finds inalienable possessions at the root of many Polynesian kingdoms, such as Hawaii and Samoa. She also credits the original idea of \"inalienable possessions\" to Mauss, who classified two categories of goods in Samoa, \"Oloa\" and \"le'Tonga\"─immovable and movable goods exchanged through marriage.\n\nBarbara Mills praised her investigation of how \"inalienable possessions are simultaneously used to construct and defeat hierarchy\", saying it \"opens a boxful of new theoretical and methodological tools for understanding social inequality in past and present societies.\" \n\nWeiner states that certain objects become inalienable only when they have acquired \"cosmological authentication\"; that is,\n\nWhat makes a possession inalienable is its exclusive and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time. Its history is authenticated by fictive or true genealogies, origin myths, sacred ancestors, and gods. In this way, inalienable possessions are transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force their loss.\nShe gives the example of a Māori Sacred Cloak and says that when a woman wears it \"she is more than herself – that she is her ancestors.\" Cloaks act as conduits for a person's hau or life giving spirit. The hau can bring strength or even knowledge potentially but a person may also have the risk of losing their hau. \"An inalienable possession acts as a stabilizing force against change because its presence authenticates cosmological origins, kinship, and political histories.\" In this way, the Cloak actually stands for the person. \"These possessions then are the most potent force in the effort to subvert change, while at the same time they stand as the corpus of change\".\n\nPaul Sillitoe queries the supposed identification of these objects with persons. He states that these objects are \"durable wealth [that] is collective property that is continually in circulation among persons who have temporary possession of it. In this view, transactable objects belong to society as a whole and are not inalienable possessions associated with certain persons. An analogy in Western culture is sporting trophies, such as championship boxing belts owned by all the clubs comprising the association that controls the competition in which constituent club members compete, and which pass for agreed periods of time into the possession of particular champions, changing hands as new champions emerge.\"\n\nTheuws argues that \"Over time, objects acquire new meanings and what was once a humble pot may become a sacred vessel.\" This transformation in the object is the result of ritualization or a change in cosmology. In fact, \"Ritual Knowledge is often a source of political power.\"\n\nHowever, these possessions may also become destabilizing, as elites reconstruct those sacred histories to identify themselves with the past; for example, Gandhi invoked the traditional hand spinning traditional cloth, khadi, to contest British rule, which Nehru referred to as Gandhi's \"livery of freedom\".\n\nInalienable possessions are nonetheless frequently drawn into exchange networks. The subtitle of Weiner's book is \"The paradox of keeping-while-giving\"; they are given as gifts (not sold) yet still retain a tie to their owners. These gifts are not like those given in regular gift giving in the West on birthdays for example. Rather, these gifts can't be re-sold for money by the receiver because the value and the significance of the gift cannot be alienated or disengaged from its relationship to those whose inalienable possession it is.\n\nThese inalienable possessions are a form of property that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property can be thought of as a bundle of rights – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory. That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it. \"To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership\". In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn \"subsequently benefits from a series of advantages.\" Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.\n\nWeiner begins by re-examining Mauss' explanation for the return gift, the \"spirit of the gift.\" The \"spirit of the gift\" was a translation of a Maori word, \"hau\". Weiner demonstrates that not \"all\" gifts must be returned. Only gifts that are \"immoveable property\" can become inalienable gifts. She further argues that inalienable possessions gain the \"mana\" (spirit) of their possessors, and so become associated with them. These goods are frequently produced by women, like the feather cloak above. The more prominent the woman, the more mana the object is thought to inherit. The longer the kin group can maintain the object in their possession, the more valuable it becomes; but it must also be periodically displayed to assert the group's status, and thus becomes an object of desire for outsiders.\n\nWeiner argues that the role of women in the exchange of inalienable possessions has been seriously underestimated. Kinship theory as developed by Claude Lévi-Strauss, used the \"sibling incest taboo\" to argue that women themselves are objects of exchange between lineage groups. Men had to find women outside their kin groups to marry hence they \"lost\" their sisters in order to gain wives. Weiner shows that the focus on women as wives ignores the importance of women as sisters (who are not \"lost\" as a result of becoming wives). Women produce inalienable possessions which they may take with them when they marry out; the inalienable possession, however, must be reclaimed by her brother after her death in order to maintain the status of the kin group. In comparing Hawaii, Samoa and the Trobriands, she argues that the more stratified a society is by ranked differences, the more important inalienable possessions produced by sisters become. The more stratified a society becomes (as in Hawaii), the closer the sibling bond (\"sibling intimacy\"). In these cases, women are critical to the \"cosmological authentication\" of inalienable possessions.\n\nA critical part of Weiner's argument is that the ability to keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. She points to the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the Dreaming.\n\nWeiner points out that the same gender relations of \"sibling intimacy\" affect the exchange of these inalienable objects. Women as sisters and women as wives provide the conduit for the gifting and return gifting of these goods, allowing the givers to build prestige. However, insofar as these inalienable possessions lose their cosmological authentication, these social hierarchies lose intergenerational longevity. Because the Dreaming itself is an inalienable possession kept secret by clan elders, it can be lost and hierarchy defeated.\n\nWeiner has used the term to categorize the many Kula valuables of the Trobriand islanders who view those objects as culturally imbued with a spiritual sense of the gift giver. Thus, when they are transferred from one individual or group to another the objects reserve meaningful bonds associated with that of the giver and their lineage. The shell bracelets and necklaces given in exchange each have their own histories, and are thus ranked on the basis of who they have been exchanged to. There were, as well, less well known shells called \"kitomu\" which were individually owned (rather than being part of lineage history), which would be given to temporarily please a disappointed trade partner expecting a more valuable shell.\n\nThe Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.\n\nKula exchange is the only way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It is for this reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.\n\nMaurice Godelier has further elaborated on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in \"The Enigma of the Gift\". He derived two theses from Weiner, to which he adds a third.\n\nFirst Thesis: As discussed above, even in a society that is dominated by a gift-giving economic and moral code, the interplay of gift and counter-gift doesn't completely dominate the social sphere, as there must be some objects which are kept and not given. These things, such as valuables, talismans, knowledge, and rites, confirm identities and their continuity over time. Moreover, they acknowledge differences of identity of individuals or groups linked by various kinds of exchanges.\n\nSecond Thesis: Women or the feminine element also exercise power by providing legitimation and redistributing of political and religious power among groups in a society. Godelier contends that Weiner refocuses attention on the role of women in constructing and legitimizing power. While women, as wives, are frequently lowered in status, as sisters, they frequently retain equal status to their brothers. For example, in Polynesia, the woman as a sister appears to control those goods associated with the sacred, the ancestors, and the gods.\n\nTo this, Godelier adds a third thesis.\n\nThird thesis: The social is not just the sum of alienable and inalienable goods, but is brought into existence by the difference and inter-dependence of these two spheres of exchange. Maintaining society thus requires not \"keeping-while-giving\", but \"\"keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping\".\"\n\n\nEconomists have often shunned the idea of pondering exactly why people want goods. Goods serve many purposes beyond what classical economists might theorize. Goods can serve as systems of social communication according to Mary Douglas, a prominent anthropologist. In fact, anthropology in general is important to economics because it talks about the socio-cultural relationships in economy and economy itself as a cultural system that is not just market-based. Moreover, entire industries are often based on gift giving such as the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, gift-giving plays an important role in the cultural development of how social and business relations evolve in major economies such as in the case of the Chinese.\n\n"}

{"id": "3111238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3111238", "title": "Intermediate scrutiny", "text": "Intermediate scrutiny\n\nIntermediate scrutiny, in U.S. constitutional law, is the second level of deciding issues using judicial review. The other levels are typically referred to as rational basis review (least rigorous) and strict scrutiny (most rigorous).\n\nIn order to overcome the intermediate scrutiny test, it must be shown that the law or policy being challenged furthers an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest. \n\nIntermediate scrutiny may be contrasted with \"strict scrutiny\", the higher standard of review that requires narrowly tailored and least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest, and \"rational basis review\", a lower standard of review that requires the law or policy be rationally related to an legitimate government interest. \n\nThis approach is most often employed in reviewing limits on commercial speech, content-neutral regulations of speech, and state actions discriminating on the basis of sex.\n\nConstitutional Equal Protection analysis applies not only to challenges against the federal government, but also to state and local governments. Although the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause applies only to state and local governments, the United States Supreme Court has implied an Equal Protection limitation on the federal government through a process known as \"reverse incorporation.\" As the Fourteenth Amendment applies directly to the states, the incorporation process was unnecessary to hold this restriction against state and local governments. Equal Protection analysis also applies to both legislative and executive action regardless if the action is of a substantive or procedural nature. Judicially crafted (common law) rules are also valid only if they conform to the requirements of Equal Protection. See, e.g., \"Reed v. Campbell\", 476 U.S. 852 (1986).\n\nIn the context of sex-based classifications, intermediate scrutiny applies to constitutional challenges of equal protection and discrimination.\n\nAn example of a court using intermediate scrutiny came in \"Craig v. Boren\", 429 U.S. 190 (1976), which was the first case in the United States Supreme Court which determined that statutory or administrative sex-based classifications were subject to an intermediate standard of judicial review.\n\nIn \"Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan\" in 1982, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the burden is on the proponent of the discrimination to establish an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for sex-based classification to be valid. As such, the court applied intermediate scrutiny in a way that is closer to strict scrutiny and in recent decisions the Court has preferred the term \"exacting scrutiny\" when referring to the intermediate level of Equal Protection analysis. For example the court applied similar exacting intermediate scrutiny when ruling on sex-based classifications in both \"J.E.B. v. Alabama\" (concerning specific strikes against male jurors during jury composition) and \"United States v. Virginia\" (concerning male-only admission to the Virginia Military Institute).\n\nIn \"Glenn v. Brumby\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that firing based on transgender status was a form of sex discrimination, and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny.\n\nRestrictions based on illegitimacy are also subjected to intermediate scrutiny in the Equal Protection context.\n\nThe courts have found such scrutiny necessary for a number of reasons. Rationally, imposing legal burdens on an illegitimate person in order to express disapproval of the conduct of her parents is illogical, unjust, and contrary to the fundamental principle that legal burdens should have some relationship to individual wrongdoing. Like race or gender, the court has stressed that an illegitimate person's status of birth is a condition over which she has no control, and it has no bearing on her ability or willingness to contribute to society. In applying increasingly exacting intermediate scrutiny, the courts have noted that illegitimate persons are a stigmatized minority, are vastly outnumbered politically, and are the target of long-standing and continuing invidious legal discrimination. For all these reasons, exacting constitutional scrutiny is mandated under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAn additional ground for heightening scrutiny of illegitimacy-based discriminatory statutes occurs whenever such statutes involve sex discrimination (as they commonly do). Following a sweep of legislative changes in almost every state in the early nineteenth century all non-marital children were legitimated as to their mothers. Each such child remained illegitimate as to her male parent, only. This gender-based classification disadvantaged male parents and privileged female parents in their fundamental familial relationship to their child. Such gender discrimination was held an additional grounds for intermediate scrutiny of statutory denial of the father-child relationship in cases such as \"Caban v. Mohammed\", 441 U.S. 380 (1979).\n\nCourts have been reluctant to apply intermediate scrutiny to cases centered around sexual orientation. For instance, in \"Romer v. Evans\" 517 US 620 (1996), which struck down an amendment to the Colorado Constitution that invalidated legal protections based on sexual orientation, the United States Supreme Court held that the amendment violated the Equal Protection Clause because the amendment was motivated by a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group, which is never a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nIn \"Lawrence v. Texas\", 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws as unconstitutional, explicitly overturning its earlier \"Bowers v. Hardwick\", 478 U.S. 186 (1986) decision, but did not specify the level of scrutiny it applied. In \"Lofton v. Secretary of the Department of Children & Family Services\", 358 F.3d 804 (11th Cir. 2004), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit explicitly held that \"Lawrence\" did not apply strict scrutiny. However, in 2008, the California Supreme Court adopted the strict scrutiny standard for state laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in the case \"In re Marriage Cases\".\n\nOn October 18, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals became the first federal appeals court, in \"Windsor v. United States\", to hold that laws that classify people based on sexual orientation should be subject to intermediate scrutiny. The decision of the Second Circuit was later affirmed by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, but the United States Supreme Court did not specifically state the level of scrutiny it applied. On January 21, 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in \"SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories\" that \"classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny\", making it the second appellate court to do so.\n\nThere are two types of laws affecting \"free speech\" among United States citizens: content-based and content-neutral. In the free speech context, intermediate scrutiny is the test or standard of review that courts apply when analyzing content-neutral speech versus content-based speech. Content-based speech is reviewed under strict scrutiny in which courts evaluate the value of the subject matter or the content of the communication. Content-neutral laws are evaluated by the nature and scope of the speech regarding the time, place and manner of communication. Content-neutral speech is reviewed under intermediate scrutiny versus strict scrutiny because this speech is only restricted by the way in which the information is communicated; not the information itself. In 1968, \"United States v. O'Brien\" established a four-factor test to determine whether restricting content-neutral speech is constitutional: (1) Is restriction within the constitutional power of government? (2) Does restriction further important or substantial governmental interest? (3) Is the governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression? (4) Is the restriction narrowly tailored – no greater than necessary? Later, a fifth factor was added in \"Ladue v. Gilleo\", 512 U.S. 43 (1994): (5) whether the restriction leaves open ample opportunities of communication.\n\nWhen deciding if a restriction is narrowly tailored, courts consider the setting of the communication. Setting has two divisions: public forum and non- public forum. In a public forum people have a right to express themselves however, not in a non-public forum. \"Adderley v. Florida\", 385 U.S. 39 (1966) held that freedom of speech may be limited in a jailhouse because a jailhouse is not a public forum therefore speech is subject to restriction. The court in Adderley v. Florida used the rational basis test standard of review even though the law was content neutral because a jailhouse is a non-public forum.\n\n\"Ward v. Rock Against Racism\", 491 U.S. 781 (1989) held that a city's restriction on loud music volume controlled by equipment and technicians is constitutional because it is narrowly tailored. \"Madsen v. Women's Health Center\", 512 U.S. 753 (1994) upheld part of an injunction restricting abortion protesters from entering the \"buffer zone\" around the abortion clinic because this was the least restrictive means and still gave protestors ample opportunity to communicate outside the buffer zone on the sidewalk, which was a public forum. The court used the strict scrutiny standard of review in \"Madsen\". \n\nIntermediate scrutiny applies to regulation that does not directly target speech but has a substantial impact on a particular message. It applies to time, place, and manner restrictions on speech, for example, with the additional requirement of \"adequate alternative channels of communication.\" In other words, if restricting the time, place, or manner of speech means that speech cannot take place at all, the regulation fails intermediate scrutiny. It has been used in \"erogenous zoning\" cases such as \"Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.\", 475 U.S. 41 (1986), that limit the concentration or require concentration of certain types of establishments. It has also been used for other types of content-neutral regulation, as well as for content-neutral speech compulsion. Intermediate scrutiny also applies to regulation of commercial speech, as long as the state interests in regulating relate to fair bargaining. Regulations for other reasons, such as protection of children, are subject to strict scrutiny.\n\nVarious federal and state laws restricting access to guns by certain people, laws that restrict or ban the acquisition or ownership of certain types of firearms by the general population, and laws that restrict the carrying of firearms by private citizens in public places have largely been upheld on the basis of intermediate scrutiny. In many of these cases, such laws have survived intermediate scrutiny on the basis that the government is furthering an \"important interest in public safety\" in enacting laws that constrain the individual right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court in its 2008 \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" decision confirmed that the right to \"keep and bear arms\" is an individual right, but also caveated that the Second Amendment is not necessarily \"a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner.\"\n\nHowever, outright bans on acquiring, possessing and carrying any and all types of firearms in Illinois, the District of Columbia and in various cities and counties (notably Chicago and San Francisco) have been struck down, failing to survive intermediate scrutiny where the courts determined that the government overreached in furthering its interest in public safety by completely banning private citizens from obtaining or possessing firearms or carrying firearms in public.\n\nThe Supreme Court has yet to clarify the exact level of scrutiny to be applied to gun control laws, though in its decision in \"D.C. v. Heller\", the Court identified a broad category of laws deemed presumptively constitutional.\n\nThe phrase \"heightened scrutiny\" has been used interchangeably with \"intermediate scrutiny\" but it is unclear if the two are actually legally interchangeable. In \"Witt v. Department of the Air Force\", 527 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 2008), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the law commonly known as \"don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) was subject to \"heightened\" scrutiny based on its analysis of \"Lawrence\". The court articulated a three-pronged test for heightened scrutiny. To pass, the law \"must advance an important governmental interest, the intrusion must significantly further that interest, and the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest\". This differs from the \"substantially related to important governmental interests\" two-prong test for \"intermediate\" scrutiny. As the Obama administration chose not to appeal \"Witt\" to the Supreme Court, it is binding precedent on the Ninth Circuit and it has been cited as such in \"Log Cabin Republicans v. United States\" (\"LCR\"), another case challenging the constitutionality of DADT. The District court in \"LCR\" applied the three-pronged test in ruling DADT unconstitutional. The administration appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit. In December 2010 DADT was legislatively repealed. On September 29, 2011, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's decision, ruling that the legislative repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell\" rendered the case moot. \n\nThe Obama administration, in its refusal to defend several lawsuits challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, argued that \"heightened\" scrutiny is the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to statutes that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n"}

As Abraham Maslow said in 1966, \"I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.\"\n\nThe concept is attributed both to Maslow and to Abraham Kaplan, although the hammer and nail line may not be original to either of them. It has in fact been attributed to sources ranging from Buddha to the Bible to Mark Twain, though it cannot be found in any of their writings. It has also been attributed to the stock market speculator and author Bernard M. Baruch.\n\nThe English expression \"a Birmingham screwdriver\" meaning a hammer, references the habit of using the one tool for all purposes, and predates both Kaplan and Maslow by at least a century.\n\nIn 1868, a London periodical, \"Once a Week\", contained this observation: \"Give a boy a hammer and chisel; show him how to use them; at once he begins to hack the doorposts, to take off the corners of shutter and window frames, until you teach him a better use for them, and how to keep his activity within bounds.\"\n\nThe first recorded statement of the concept was Abraham Kaplan's, in 1964: \"I call it \"the law of the instrument,\" and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding.\"\n\nIn February 1962, Abraham Kaplan, then a Professor of Philosophy, gave a banquet speech at a conference of the American Educational Research Association that was being held at UCLA. An article in the June 1962 issue of the \"Journal of Medical Education\" stated that \"the highlight of the 3-day meeting ... was to be found in Kaplan's comment on the choice of methods for research. He urged that scientists exercise good judgment in the selection of appropriate methods for their research. Because certain methods happen to be handy, or a given individual has been trained to use a specific method, is no assurance that the method is appropriate for all problems. He cited Kaplan’s Law of the Instrument: 'Give a boy a hammer and everything he meets has to be pounded.\n\nIn \"The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science\" (1964), Kaplan again mentioned the law of the instrument saying, \"It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled.\" And in a 1964 article for \"The Library Quarterly\", he again cited the law and commented: \"We tend to formulate our problems in such a way as to make it seem that the solutions to those problems demand precisely what we already happen to have at hand.\"\n\nIn a 1963 essay collection, \"Computer Simulation of Personality: Frontier of Psychological Theory\", Silvan Tomkins wrote about \"the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs\". He wrote: \"If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails, and if one has a computer with a storage capacity, but no feelings, one is more likely to concern oneself with remembering and with problem solving than with loving and hating.\" In the same book, Kenneth Mark Colby explicitly cited the law, writing: \"The First Law of the Instrument states that if you give a boy a hammer, he suddenly finds that everything needs pounding. The computer program may be our current hammer, but it must be tried. One cannot decide from purely armchair considerations whether or not it will be of any value.\"\n\n\"Maslow's hammer,\" popularly phrased as \"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail\" and variants thereof, is from Abraham Maslow's \"The Psychology of Science\", published in 1966. Abraham Maslow wrote: \"I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated automatic washing machine for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But it could do only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated as if it were an automobile to be washed. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.\"\n\nIn his 2003 book, \"Of Paradise and Power\", historian Robert Kagan suggested a corollary to the law: \"When you don't have a hammer, you don't want anything to look like a nail.\" According to Kagan, the corollary explains the difference in views on the use of military force the United States and Europe have held since the end of World War II.\n\nIn 1967, Lee Loevinger of the Federal Communications Commission dubbed the law \"Loevinger's law of irresistible use\", and applied it to government: \"The political science analogue is that if there is a government agency, this proves something needs regulating.\"\n\nIn 1984, investor Warren Buffett criticized academic studies of financial markets that made use of inappropriate mathematical approaches: \"It isn't necessarily because such studies have any utility; it's simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"\n\nOne application the law of the instrument has been observed in is the prescribing usage of anti-psychotic drugs. During Maslow's era, the only medicines available for psychiatric patients were the anti-psychotics stelazine and thorazine, so it was often the case that other mental illnesses were treated as if they were psychoses.\n\nThe notion of a \"golden hammer,\" \"a familiar technology or concept applied obsessively to many software problems\", was introduced into information technology literature in 1998 as an anti-pattern: a programming practice to be avoided.\n\nSoftware developer José M. Gilgado has written that the law is still relevant in the 21st century and is highly applicable to software development. Many times software developers, he observed, \"tend to use the same known tools to do a completely new different project with new constraints\". He blamed this on \"the comfort zone state where you don't change anything to avoid risk. The problem with using the same tools every time you can is that you don't have enough arguments to make a choice because you have nothing to compare to and is limiting your knowledge.\" The solution is \"to keep looking for the best possible choice, even if we aren't very familiar with it\". This includes using a computer language with which one is unfamiliar. He noted that the product RubyMotion enables developers to \"wrap\" unknown computer languages in a familiar computer language and thus avoid having to learn them. But Gilgado found this approach inadvisable, because it reinforces the habit of avoiding new tools.\n\nOne observer stated in 2016 that the law of the instrument may be \"the least discussed law when talking about education\", but is \"the most important to warn for in educational discussions\". He asked: \"How many times do you read: this tool will change everything in education? We know that it won’t, but most of the time the person expressing this is really convinced of his hammer.\" Some educators say: \"let’s teach all children how to code\".\n\nOther forms of narrow-minded instrumentalism include: déformation professionnelle, a French term for \"looking at things from the point of view of one's profession\", and regulatory capture, the tendency for regulators to look at things from the point of view of the profession they are regulating.\n\n"}
{"id": "3986852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3986852", "title": "Logical truth", "text": "Logical truth\n\nLogical truth is one of the most fundamental concepts in logic, and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a statement which is true, and remains true under all reinterpretations of its components other than its logical constants. It is a type of analytic statement. All of philosophical logic can be thought of as providing accounts of the nature of logical truth, as well as logical consequence.\n\nLogical truths (including tautologies) are truths which are considered to be necessarily true. This is to say that they are considered to be such that they could not be untrue and no situation could arise which would cause us to reject a logical truth. It must be true in every sense of intuition, practices, and bodies of beliefs. However, it is not universally agreed that there are any statements which are \"necessarily\" true.\n\nA logical truth is considered by some philosophers to be a statement which is true in all possible worlds. This is contrasted with facts (which may also be referred to as \"contingent claims\" or \"synthetic claims\") which are true in \"this\" world, as it has historically unfolded, but which is not true in at least one possible world, as it might have unfolded. The proposition \"If p and q, then p\" and the proposition \"All married people are married\" are logical truths because they are true due to their inherent structure and not because of any facts of the world. \nLater, with the rise of formal logic a logical truth was considered to be a statement which is true under all possible interpretations.\n\nThe existence of logical truths has been put forward by rationalist philosophers as an objection to empiricism because they hold that it is impossible to account for our knowledge of logical truths on empiricist grounds. Empiricists commonly respond to this objection by arguing that logical truths (which they usually deem to be mere tautologies), are analytic and thus do not purport to describe the world.\n\nLogical truths, being analytic statements, do not contain any information about any matters of fact. Other than logical truths, there is also a second class of analytic statements, typified by \"no bachelor is married\". The characteristic of such a statement is that it can be turned into a logical truth by substituting synonyms for synonyms \"salva veritate\". \"No bachelor is married\" can be turned into \"no unmarried man is married\" by substituting \"unmarried man\" for its synonym \"bachelor\".\n\nIn his essay Two Dogmas of Empiricism, the philosopher W. V. O. Quine called into question the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. It was this second class of analytic statements that caused him to note that the concept of analyticity itself stands in need of clarification, because it seems to depend on the concept of synonymy, which stands in need of clarification. In his conclusion, Quine rejects that logical truths are necessary truths. Instead he posits that the truth-value of any statement can be changed, including logical truths, given a re-evaluation of the truth-values of every other statement in one's complete theory.\n\nConsidering different interpretations of the same statement leads to the notion of truth value. The simplest approach to truth values means that the statement may be \"true\" in one case, but \"false\" in another. In one sense of the term \"tautology\", it is any type of formula or proposition which turns out to be true under any possible interpretation of its terms (may also be called a valuation or assignment depending upon the context). This is synonymous to logical truth.\n\nHowever, the term \"tautology\" is also commonly used to refer to what could more specifically be called truth-functional tautologies. Whereas a tautology or logical truth is true solely because of the logical terms it contains in general (e.g. \"every\", \"some\", and \"is\"), a truth-functional tautology is true because of the logical terms it contains which are logical connectives (e.g. \"or\", \"and\", and \"nor\"). Not all logical truths are tautologies of such a kind.\n\nLogical constants, including logical connectives and quantifiers, can all be reduced conceptually to logical truth. For instance, two statements or more are logically incompatible \"if, and only if\" their conjunction is logically false. One statement logically implies another when it is logically incompatible with the negation of the other. A statement is logically true if, and only if its opposite is logically false. The opposite statements must contradict one another. In this way all logical connectives can be expressed in terms of preserving logical truth. The logical form of a sentence is determined by its semantic or syntactic structure and by the placement of logical constants. Logical constants determine whether a statement is a logical truth when they are combined with a language that limits its meaning. Therefore, until it is determined how to make a distinction between all logical constants regardless of their language, it is impossible to know the complete truth of a statement or argument.\n\nThe concept of logical truth is closely connected to the concept of a rule of inference.\n\nLogical positivism was a movement in the 20th century and was followed to a great extent in Europe and the United States. It is a structured method of determining how valid the knowledge is. It introduced mathematics and the natural sciences into the field of philosophy. It is also known as scientific empiricism. Logical positivism considers philosophy as an analytical inquiry. Philosophy was deciphered as an activity rather than a theory. Logical positivists worked to explain the language of science by showing that scientific theories could be broken down to logical truths along with the experience of the five senses. The concepts created in this movement are very closely followed today in the West. Logical positivism was a way to decipher whether a statement was truly a logical truth by means of relating it to a scientific theory or mathematics. It determined the validity of the statement as well as gave it the rank of a logical truth or a false truth.\n\nNon-classical logic is the name given to formal systems which differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as propositional and predicate logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations. The aim of these departures is to make it possible to construct different models of logical consequence and logical truth.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19717225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19717225", "title": "Manic Pixie Dream Girl", "text": "Manic Pixie Dream Girl\n\nManic Pixie Dream Girl (MPDG) is a stock character type in films. Film critic Nathan Rabin, who coined the term after observing Kirsten Dunst's character in \"Elizabethtown\" (2005), said that the MPDG \"exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures.\" MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.\n\nThe Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the Magical Negro, a black character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the white savior protagonist. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life, and usually only exists to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.\n\nMPDGs are usually static characters who have eccentric personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the romantic interest for a (most often brooding or depressed) male protagonist. Examples of an MPDG are described below:\n\n\nIn an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of \"New York\", about her film \"Ruby Sparks\", actress and screenwriter Zoe Kazan criticized the term as reductive, diminutive, and misogynistic. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in \"Bringing Up Baby\" is a MPDG: \"I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference.\"\n\nIn a December 2012 video, AllMovie critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.\n\nIn December 2012, \"Slate\"s Aisha Harris posited that \"critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself\", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become \"self-aware about such characters\" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.\n\nIn July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for \"The Cut\", argued that the term itself had become sexist, citing her opinion that \"it was levied, criminally at Diane Keaton in \"Annie Hall\" and Zooey Deschanel, the actual person. \"How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?\"\"\"\n\nSimilar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for \"The Week\" in April 2013, who wrote \"this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism\". Bartyzel argues that \"[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality.\"\n\nIn July 2014, for \"Salon\", Rabin prompted a retraction of the term \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\". He argued that in \"giving an idea a fuzzy definition\", he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the \"phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself\". Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for \"creating this unstoppable monster\".\n\nRecently there has been discussion of a male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy. Augustus Waters from the film version of \"The Fault in Our Stars\" (2014) was given this title in a 2014 \"Vulture\" article, in which Matt Patches stated, \"he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can \"actually\" have in our lives.\"\n\nThe Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"30 Rock\". The female protagonists of these shows are married to men (Adam Scott's Ben Wyatt and James Marsden's Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 \"Grantland\" article, \"patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self\".\n\nThe character Jesse, played by Skylar Astin, in the film \"Pitch Perfect\" (2012) embodies the Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope. His role in the film appears to be to coax the very serious character Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, out of her gloom and embrace life to the fullest. He has no backstory of his own, and no major goals of his own in the context of the film. According to an article on Ohio State's Entertainment News site.\n\nAnother version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. The difference is that the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence of some sort. The function is the same one: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are: Joi in \"Blade Runner 2049\" and Samantha in Spike Jonze's \"Her\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1481355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1481355", "title": "Marginal value theorem", "text": "Marginal value theorem\n\nThe marginal value theorem (MVT) is an optimality model that usually describes the behavior of an optimally foraging individual in a system where resources (often food) are located in discrete patches separated by areas with no resources. Due to the resource-free space, animals must spend time traveling between patches. The MVT can also be applied to other situations in which organisms face diminishing returns.\n\nThe MVT was first proposed by Eric Charnov in 1976. In his original formulation: \"The predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat.\"\n\nAll animals must forage for food in order to meet their energetic needs, but doing so is energetically costly. It is assumed that evolution by natural selection results in animals utilizing the most economic and efficient strategy to balance energy gain and consumption. The Marginal Value Theorem is an optimality model that describes the strategy that maximizes gain per unit time in systems where resources, and thus rate of returns, decrease with time. The model weighs benefits and costs and is used to predict giving up time and giving up density. Giving up time (GUT) is the interval of time between when the animal last feeds and when it leaves the patch. Giving up density (GUD) is the food density within a patch when the animal will choose to move on to other food patches.\n\nWhen an animal is foraging in a system where food sources are patchily distributed, the MVT can be used to predict how much time an individual will spend searching for a particular patch before moving on to a new one. In general, individuals will stay longer if (1) patches are farther apart or (2) current patches are poor in resources. Both situations increase the ratio of travel cost to foraging benefit.\n\nAs animals forage in patchy systems, they balance resource intake, traveling time, and foraging time. Resource intake within a patch diminishes with time, as shown by the solid curve in the graph to the right. The curve follows this pattern because resource intake is initially very fast, but slows as the resource is depleted. Traveling time is shown by the distance from the leftmost vertical dotted line to the y-axis. Optimal foraging time is modeled by connecting this point on the x-axis tangentially to the resource intake curve. Doing so maximizes the ratio between resource intake and time spent foraging and traveling.\n\nAt the extremes of the loading curve, animals spend too much time traveling for a small payoff, or they search too long in a given patch for an ineffective load. The MVT identifies the best possible intermediate between these extremes.\n\n\nA common illustration of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.\n\nGreat tits are a species of bird found throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and research has shown that their behavior can be modeled by optimal foraging models, including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie, birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Daenzer (1999), great tits were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because great tits were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT. This data supports the use of the MVT in predicting the foraging behavior of great tits.\n\nExperimental evidence has shown that screaming hairy armadillos and guinea pigs qualitatively follow MVT when foraging. The researchers ran several parallel experiments: one for each animal under consistent patch quality, and one for guinea pigs with varying patch quality. While the qualitative foraging trend was shown to follow MVT in each case, the quantitative analysis indicated that each patch was exploited further than expected.\n\nThe MVT can be used to model foraging in plants as well as animals. Plants have been shown to preferentially place their roots, which are their foraging organs, in areas of higher resource concentration. Recall that the MVT predicts that animals will forage for longer in patches with higher resource quality. Plants increase root biomass in layers/areas of soil that are rich in nutrients and resources, and decrease root growth into areas of poor-quality soil. Thus, plants grow roots into patches of soil according to their wealth of resources in a manner consistent with the MVT. Additionally, plant roots grow more quickly through low-quality patches of soil than through high-quality patches of soil, just as foraging animals are predicted to spend less time in low-quality areas than high-quality areas.\n\nThe MVT can be applied to situations other than foraging in which animals experience diminished returns. Consider, for example, the mating copulation duration of the yellow dung fly. In the dung fly mating system, males gather on fresh cow droppings and wait for females to arrive in smaller groups to lay their eggs. Males must compete with each other for the chance to mate with arriving females—sometimes one male will kick another male off of a female and take over mating with the female mid-copulation. In this instance, the second male fertilizes about 80% of the eggs. Thus, after a male has mated with a female he guards her so that no other males will have the opportunity to mate with her and displace his sperm before she lays her eggs. After the female lays her eggs, the male must take the time to search for another female before he is able to copulate again.\n\nThe question, then, is how long the dung fly should spend copulating with each female. On one hand, the longer a male dung fly copulates the more eggs he can fertilize. However, the benefits of extra copulation time diminish quickly, as the male loses the chance to find another female during long copulations. The MVT predicts that the optimal copulation time is just long enough to fertilize about 80% of the eggs; after this time, the rewards are much smaller and are not worth missing out on another mate. This predicted value for copulation time, 40 minutes, is very close to the average observed value, 36 minutes.\n\nIn dung flies, the observed values of copulation time and time searching for another mate vary with body weight. Heavier males have shorter search times and shorter copulation times. These shorter search times are likely due to increased cost of travel with increased body weight; shorter copulation times probably reflect that it is easier for heavier males to successfully take over females mid-copulation. Additionally, researchers have taken into account “patch quality,” i.e. the quality of females arriving on the various cowpats. Research also shows that males copulate for longer with the larger females who hold more eggs and have larger reproductive tract dimensions. Thus, males change their copulation time to maximize their fitness, but they are doing so in response to selection imposed by female morphology. Even with these variations, male dung flies do exhibit close-to-optimal copulation time relative to their body size, as predicted by the MVT.\n\nMany studies, such as the examples presented above, have shown good qualitative support for predictions generated by the Marginal Value Theorem. However, in some more quantitative studies, the predictions of the MVT haven’t been as successful, with the observed values substantially deviating from predictions. One proposed explanation for these deviations is that it is difficult to objectively measure payoff rates. For example, an animal in an unpredictable environment may need to spend extra time sampling, making it hard for researchers to determine foraging time.\nBeyond this imprecision, some researchers propose that there is something fundamental missing from the model. Namely, animals are probably doing more than just foraging, whether it be dealing with predation risks or searching for mating opportunities. Natural selection is not the only force influencing the evolution of species. Sexual selection, for example, may alter foraging behaviors, making them less consistent with the MVT. These researchers point out that the marginal value theorem is a starting point, but complexity and nuances must be incorporated into models and tests for foraging and patch-use.\n\nOne other type of model that has been used in place of MVT in predicting foraging behavior is the state-dependent behavior model. Although state-dependent models have been viewed as a generalization of the MVT, they are unlikely to generate broadly applicable predictions like those from the MVT because they test predictions under a specific set of conditions. While the predictions of these models must be tested under precise conditions, they might offer valuable insights not available from broader models such as MVT.\n\n"}

The concept is studied in philosophy of mathematics.\n\nIn mathematical practice, an \"object\" is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, permutations, partitions, matrices, sets, functions, and relations. Geometry as a branch of mathematics has such objects as hexagons, points, lines, triangles, circles, spheres, polyhedra, topological spaces and manifolds. Another branch—algebra—has groups, rings, fields, group-theoretic lattices, and order-theoretic lattices. Categories are simultaneously homes to mathematical objects and mathematical objects in their own right. In proof theory, proofs and theorems are also mathematical objects.\n\nThe ontological status of mathematical objects has been the subject of much investigation and debate by philosophers of mathematics.\n\nOne view that emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the work of Cantor is that all mathematical objects can be defined as sets. The set {0,1} is a relatively clear-cut example. On the face of it the group Z of integers mod 2 is also a set with two elements. However, it cannot simply be the set {0,1}, because this does not mention the additional structure imputed to Z by the operations of addition and negation mod 2: how are we to tell which of 0 or 1 is the additive identity, for example? To organize this group as a set it can first be coded as the quadruple ({0,1},+,−,0), which in turn can be coded using one of several conventions as a set representing that quadruple, which in turn entails encoding the operations + and − and the constant 0 as sets.\n\nSets may include ordered denotation of the particular identities and operations that apply to them, indicating a group, abelian group, ring, field, or other mathematical object. These types of mathematical objects are commonly studied in abstract algebra.\n\nIf, however, the goal of mathematical ontology is taken to be the internal consistency of mathematics, it is more important that mathematical objects be definable in some uniform way (for example, as sets) regardless of actual practice, in order to lay bare the essence of its paradoxes. This has been the viewpoint taken by foundations of mathematics, which has traditionally accorded the management of paradox higher priority than the faithful reflection of the details of mathematical practice as a justification for defining mathematical objects to be sets.\n\nMuch of the tension created by this foundational identification of mathematical objects with sets can be relieved without unduly compromising the goals of foundations by allowing two kinds of objects into the mathematical universe, sets and relations, without requiring that either be considered merely an instance of the other. These form the basis of model theory as the domain of discourse of predicate logic. From this viewpoint, mathematical objects are entities satisfying the axioms of a formal theory expressed in the language of predicate logic.\n\nA variant of this approach replaces relations with operations, the basis of universal algebra. In this variant the axioms often take the form of equations, or implications between equations.\n\nA more abstract variant is category theory, which abstracts sets as objects and the operations thereon as morphisms between those objects. At this level of abstraction mathematical objects reduce to mere vertices of a graph whose edges as the morphisms abstract the ways in which those objects can transform and whose structure is encoded in the composition law for morphisms. Categories may arise as the models of some axiomatic theory and the homomorphisms between them (in which case they are usually concrete, meaning equipped with a faithful forgetful functor to the category Set or more generally to a suitable topos), or they may be constructed from other more primitive categories, or they may be studied as abstract objects in their own right without regard for their provenance.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3022453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3022453", "title": "Nafs", "text": "Nafs\n\nNafs () is an Arabic word occurring in the Quran and means \"self\", \"psyche\", \"ego\" or \"soul\". In the Quran, the word is used in both the individualistic (verse 2:48) and collective sense (verse 4:1), indicating that although humanity is united in possessing the qualities of a \"nafs\" (i.e. \"soul\" or \"consciousness\"), they are individually responsible for exercising the agencies of the \"free will\" that it provides them.\nMuch of the popular literature on \"nafs\", however, is focused on the Sufi conceptions of the term. According to the Sufi philosophies, the \"nafs\" in its unrefined state is \"the ego\", which they consider to be the lowest dimension of a person's inward existence — his animal and Satanic nature. \"Nafs\" is an important concept in the Islamic tradition, especially within Sufism and the discipline of gnosis (\"irfan\") in Shia Islam.\n\nThe triliteral root \"nūn fā sīn\" (ن ف س) occurs 298 times in the Quran, in four derived forms:\n\n\nThe noun \"nafs\" has important instances in the Quran such as the following: \"O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves...\" The major theme of the word \"nafs\" as used in the Quran is to instill a sense of individual responsibility through a strong emphasis on the choices made by the individual (as in 5:105), while at the same time reminding humanity of its common origins (verse 4:1).\n\nThe Quran affords much importance to the \"nafs\" of an individual, highlighting the agency of free will and intelligence, without which neither responsibility nor accountability can exist. The Quran does not attribute to the \"nafs\" any inherent properties of good or evil, but instead conveys the idea that it is something which has to be nurtured and self-regulated, so that it can progress into becoming 'good' through its thoughts and actions. The Quranic conception of the \"nafs\" therefore has an extremely modernistic undertone, much like Nietzsche's conception of \"Übermensch\" or 'Superman', as suggested by Muhammad Iqbal, a prominent Muslim scholar and philosopher, who went as far as to accuse Nietzsche of borrowing the term from Islamic thought. Iqbal stated: \"It is probable that Nietzsche borrowed it (Übermensch) from the literature of Islam or of the East and degraded it by his materialism.\"\n\nThere are three principal stages of \"nafs\" in Sufistic Wisdom, also mentioned in different verses of the Quran. The Sufis call them \"stages\" in the process of development, refinement and mastery of the \"nafs\".\nIn its primitive stage the \"nafs\" incites us to commit evil: this is the \"nafs\" as the lower self, the base instincts. In the eponymous Sura of the Quran, Yusuf says \"Yet I claim not that my \"nafs\" was innocent: Verily the \"nafs\" incites to evil.\"\nIslam emphasizes the importance of fighting the inciting \"nafs\" in Quran as well as in hadith. One tradition holds that Muhammad said after returning from a war, \"We now return from the small struggle (Jihad Asghar) to the big struggle (Jihad Akbar)\". His companions asked, \"O prophet of God, what is the big struggle?\" He replied, \"The struggle against \"nafs\".\"\n\nThis stage is generally divided into the levels \"al nafs al-hayawaniyya\" und \"al nafs al-iblissiyya\". \"Al nafs al-hayawaniyya\" (\"the animal state\") describes the self, which runs after material possessesion, sensual desires and animalistic pleasures. \"Al nafs al-iblissiyya\" is even lower than the animal state, because the self seeks to replace God in the love for itself.\n\nThe Quran enjoins the faithful \"to hinder the \"nafs\" from lust\", and another traditional narration warns that \"the worst enemy you have is [the \"nafs\"] between your sides.\" Rumi warns of the \"nafs\" in its guise of religious hypocrisy, saying \"the \"nafs\" has a rosary and a Koran in its right hand, and a scimitar and dagger in the sleeve.\"\n\nAnimal imagery is often used to describe the \"nafs\". A popular image is a donkey or unruly horse that must be trained and broken so that eventually it will bear its rider to the goal. Rumi compares the \"nafs\" to a camel that the hero Majnun, representing the intellect ('Aql), strains to turn in the direction of the dwelling-place of his beloved.\n\nIn Sura al-Qiyama the Quran mentions \"the self-accusing \"nafs\"\". This is the stage where \"the conscience is awakened and the self accuses one for listening to one’s ego. One repents and asks for forgiveness.\" Here the \"nafs\" is inspired by your heart, sees the results of your actions, agrees with your brain, sees your weaknesses, and aspires to perfection.\n\nIn Sura al-Fajr the Quran mentions \"the \"nafs\" at peace\". This is the ideal stage of ego for Muslims. On this level one is firm in one’s faith and leaves bad manners behind. The soul becomes tranquil, at peace. At this stage, followers of Sufism have relieved themselves of all materialism and worldly problems and are satisfied with the will of God.\n\nIn addition to the three principal stages, another four are sometimes cited:\n\nThis stage comes between the 2nd and 3rd principal stages. It is the stage of action. On this level \"one becomes more firm in listening to one’s conscience, but is not yet surrendered.\" Once you have seen your weaknesses and have set your targets, this ego inspires you to do good deeds and to be on the plus side. The Sufis say that it is important that whenever you think of good, you must immediately act upon it. Abbas Bin Abdul Muttalib lays down three rules:\n\nAccording to the Quran, charity should be given both secretly and openly. In Muhammad Asad's translation of the Quran, 14:31 reads: \"[And] tell [those of] My servants who have attained to faith that they should be constant in prayer and spend [in Our way], secretly and openly, out of what We provide for them as sustenance, ere there come a Day when there will be no bargaining, and no mutual befriending.\"\n\nThe stage comes after the 3rd principal stage. On this level \"one is pleased with whatever comes from Allah and doesn’t live in the past or future, but in the moment.\" \"One thinks always: ‘Ilahi Anta Maqsudi wa ridhaka matlubi’. One always sees oneself as weak and in need of Allah.\"\n\nOn this level the two Ruhs in man \"have made peace\". \"One is soft and tolerant with people and has good Akhlaq (Arabic: أخلاق), good manners.\"\n\nOn this level \"one is dressed in the attributes of the Insan Kamil, the perfected man, who is completely surrendered and inspired by Allah.\" One is \"in full agreement with the Will of Allah\".\n\nTherefore, the full sequence of the seven stages of the development of the \"nafs\" is as follows:\n\n\nDervishes from the Jerrahi school of Sufism are encouraged to study a text describing these stages of \"nafs\" as a nested series of cities.\n\nIn its primitive state the \"nafs\" has seven characteristics that must be overcome:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21876751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21876751", "title": "Optical sorting", "text": "Optical sorting\n\nOptical sorting (sometimes called digital sorting) is the automated process of sorting solid products using cameras and/or lasers.\n\nDepending on the types of sensors used and the software-driven intelligence of the image processing system, optical sorters can recognize objects' color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition. The sorter compares objects to user-defined accept/reject criteria to identify and remove defective products and foreign material (FM) from the production line, or to separate product of different grades or types of materials.\nOptical sorters are in widespread use in the food industry worldwide, with the highest adoption in processing harvested foods such as potatoes, fruits, vegetables and nuts where it achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The technology is also used in pharmaceutical manufacturing and nutraceutical manufacturing, tobacco processing, waste recycling and other industries. Compared to manual sorting, which is subjective and inconsistent, optical sorting helps improve product quality, maximize throughput and increase yields while reducing labor costs.\n\nIn general, optical sorters feature four major components: the feed system, the optical system, image processing software and the separation system. The objective of the feed system is to spread product into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system, usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products like whole potatoes, pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while good product continues along its normal trajectory.\n\nThe ideal sorter depends on the application, with the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determining the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.\n\nOptical sorters require a compatible combination of light and sensors to illuminate objects and capture images of the objects before the images can be processed and accept/reject decisions made.\n\nThere are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of cameras and lasers on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) spectrums. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.\n\n Monochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.\n\nSophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. Trichromatic color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.\n\nCoupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object. They use high beam infrared laser beams to show the laser on the beam.\n\nWhile cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to interrogate a material's structural properties in addition to determining differences in color. This structural property inspection capability makes lasers ideal for detecting a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic, even if they are the same color as the good product, and for separating various materials at waste recycling facilities.\n\nLasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light, within the visible spectrums and beyond. For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths, a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.\n\nSorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal. \n\n Driven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems are being developed.\n\nLike trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique spectral signature (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of chemometrics.\n\nOnce the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing algorithms that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.\n\nObject-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.\n\nNew software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.\n\nThe considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product – large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize – and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.\n\nThe simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of color sorter that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.\n\nFor products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.\n\nAs the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.\n\n Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.\n\nA fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.\n\nThe platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.\n\nFor products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.\n\n"}

If the defendant pleaded either guilty or not guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property escheating to the Crown. If they refused to plead their heirs would inherit their estate, even if they died in the process.\n\nThe common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own jurisdiction. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court. Obviously, a criminal justice system that could punish only those who had volunteered for possible punishment was unworkable; a means was needed to coerce them into entering a plea. Alternatively, individuals were frequently tried under Admiralty law, as observed by Henry de Bracton.\n\nThe \"Standing Mute Act 1275\", part of Statute of Westminster of 1275 of Edward I of England, states:\nIt appears to have initially meant imprisonment under harsh conditions:\n\nBy the reign of Elizabeth I it took the form of \"pressing\" the accused with weights. \nThe procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness as follows:\n\"Pressing to death\" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London, says the following about the English practice:\n\"\" was abolished in the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1772, with the last known actual use of the practice having been in 1741. From 1772 refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty, but this was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty – which is now the case in all common law jurisdictions.\n\nThe most famous case in England was that of Roman Catholic martyr St Margaret Clitherow, who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence and could be tortured) was pressed to death on 25 March 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) priests in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least . Several hardened criminals, including William Spiggot (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under , and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.\n\nIn America, Giles Corey was pressed to death between September 17 and September 19, 1692, during the Salem witch trials, after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were \"More weight\", and he was thought to have been killed as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama \"The Crucible\", where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead \"aye or nay\" to the charge of witchcraft. In the film version of this play, the screenplay of which was also by Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1113569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113569", "title": "Polish Operation of the NKVD", "text": "Polish Operation of the NKVD\n\nThe Polish Operation of the Soviet security service in 1937–1938 was a mass operation of the NKVD carried out in the Soviet Union against Poles (labeled by the Soviets as \"agents\") during the period of the Great Purge. It was ordered by the Politburo against the so-called \"Polish spies\" and customarily interpreted by the NKVD officials as relating to 'absolutely all Poles'. It resulted in the sentencing of 139,835 people, and summary executions of 111,091 Poles. The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order № 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov. The majority of the shooting victims were ethnically Polish, but not all, wrote Timothy Snyder. The remainder were 'suspected' of being Polish, without further inquiry, or classed as possibly having pro-Polish sympathies. In order to speed up the process the NKVD personnel reviewed local telephone books and arrested persons with Polish-sounding names.\n\nThe Polish Operation was the largest ethnic shooting and deportation action during the Great Terror campaign of political murders in the Soviet Union, orchestrated by Nikolai Yezhov.<ref name=\"B/E/F\"></ref> It is also the largest killing of Poles in history outside any armed conflict.\n\nThe top secret NKVD Order No. 00485, titled \"\"On the liquidation of the Polish diversionist and espionage groups and POW units\",\" was approved on August 9, 1937 by the Party's Central Committee Politburo, and was signed by Nikolai Yezhov on August 11, 1937. It was distributed to the local subdivisions of the NKVD simultaneously with Yezhov's thirty-page \"secret letter,\" explaining what the \"Polish operation\" was all about. The letter from Yezhov was titled, \"On fascist-resurrectionist, spying, diversional, defeationist, and terrorist activity of Polish intelligence in the USSR\". Stalin demanded the NKVD to \"keep on digging out and cleaning out this Polish filth.\"\nThe \"Order\" adopted the simplified so-called \"album procedure\" (as it was called in NKVD circles). The long lists of Poles condemned by a lower NKVD organ (so-called \"dvoika\", a two-man team) during early meetings, were then collected into \"albums\" and sent to the midrange NKVD offices for a stamp of approval by a \"troika\" (a three-man team; a communist official, NKVD leader, and party procurator). Poles were the first ever major Soviet population group to be sentenced in this manner. After the approval of the entire \"album\", the executions were carried out immediately. This procedure was also used later on in other mass operations of the NKVD.\n\nThe \"Polish Operation\" was a second in a series of national operations of the NKVD, carried out by the Soviet Union against ethnic groups including Latvian, Finnish, German and Romanian, based on a theory about an internal enemy (i.e. the fifth column) labelled as the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" residing along its western borders. In opinion of historian Timothy Snyder, this fabricated justification was intended only to cover-up the state-sanctioned campaign of mass-murder aiming to eradicate Poles as a national (and linguistic) minority group. Another possible cause according to Snyder might have sprung from the necessity to explain the Soviet-made famine in Ukraine which required a political scapegoat. A top Soviet official Vsevolod Balitsky chose the Polish Military Organization which was disbanded in 1921. The NKVD declared that it continued to exist. Some Soviet Poles were tortured in order to confess to its existence, and denounce other individuals as spies. Meanwhile, the Communist International helped by revisiting its files in search of Polish members, producing another bountiful source of made-up evidence.\n\nThe operation took place approximately from August 25, 1937 to November 15, 1938. The largest group of people with Polish background, around 40 percent of all victims, came from the Soviet Ukraine, especially from the districts near the border with Poland. Among them were tens of thousands of peasants, railway workers, industrial labourers, engineers and others. An additional 17 percent of victims came from the Soviet Byelorussia. The rest came from around Western Siberia and Kazakhstan, where exiled Poles had lived since the Partitions, as well as from the southern Urals, northern Caucasus and the rest of Siberia, including the Far East.\n\nThe following categories of people were arrested by the NKVD during its Polish operation, as described in Soviet documents:\n\nAccording to archives of the NKVD: 111,091 Poles and people accused of ties with Poland, were sentenced to death, and 28,744 were sentenced to labor camps (known as the \"dry guillotine\" of slow death by exposure, malnutrition, and overwork); 139,835 victims in total. This number constitutes 10% of the total number of people officially convicted during the Yezhovshchina period, based on confirming NKVD documents.\n\nThe Operation was only a peak in the persecution of the Poles, which spanned more than a decade. As the Soviet statistics indicate, the number of ethnic Poles in the USSR dropped by 165,000 in that period. \"It is estimated that Polish losses in the Ukrainian SSR were about 30%, while in the Belorussian SSR... the Polish minority was almost completely annihilated.\"\n\nTimothy Snyder gives a conservative estimate of 85,000 confirmed Poles executed simultaneously across the country.\n\nAlmost all victims of the NKVD shootings were men, wrote Michał Jasiński, most with families. Their wives and children were dealt with by the NKVD Order № 00486. The women were generally sentenced to deportation to Kazakhstan for an average of 5 to 10 years. Their children were put in orphanages to be brought up as Soviet, with no knowledge of their origins. All possessions of the accused were confiscated. The parents of the executed men – as well as their in-laws – were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well. Statistical extrapolation, wrote Jasiński, increases the number of Polish victims in 1937–1938 to around 200–250,000 depending on size of their families.\n\nIn Leningrad, the NKVD reviewed local telephone books and arrested almost 7,000 citizens with Polish-sounding name with the vast majority of such nominal \"suspects\" were executed within 10 days of arrest.\n\nHistorian Michael Ellman asserts that the \"national operations\", particularly the \"Polish Operation\", may have constituted genocide as defined by the UN convention. His opinion is shared by Simon Sebag Montefiore, who calls the Polish operation of the NKVD \"a mini-genocide\". Polish writer and commentator, Dr Tomasz Sommer, also refers to the operation as a genocide, along with Prof. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz among others.\n\n"}
{"id": "542885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542885", "title": "Pygmalion effect", "text": "Pygmalion effect\n\nThe Pygmalion effect, or Rosenthal effect, is the phenomenon whereby others' expectations of a target person affect the target person's performance. The effect is named after the Greek myth of Pygmalion, a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved, or alternately, after the Rosenthal–Jacobson study (see below).\n\nA corollary of the Pygmalion effect is the golem effect, in which low expectations lead to a decrease in performance; both effects are forms of self-fulfilling prophecy. By the Pygmalion effect, people internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly. The idea behind the Pygmalion effect is that increasing the leader's expectation of the follower's performance will result in better follower performance. Within sociology, the effect is often cited with regard to education and social class. The concept of stereotype threat could be considered to be the inverse of the Pygmalion effect, as it denotes a negative form of self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nRobert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson's study showed that, if teachers were led to expect enhanced performance from children, then the children's performance was enhanced. This study supported the hypothesis that reality can be positively or negatively influenced by the expectations of others, called the observer-expectancy effect. Rosenthal argued that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies.\n\nAll students in a single California elementary school were given a disguised IQ test at the beginning of the study. These scores were not disclosed to teachers. Teachers were told that some of their students (about 20% of the school chosen at random) could be expected to be \"intellectual bloomers\" that year, doing better than expected in comparison to their classmates. The bloomers' names were made known to the teachers. At the end of the study, all students were again tested with the same IQ-test used at the beginning of the study. All six grades in both experimental and control groups showed a mean gain in IQ from before the test to after the test. However, First and Second Graders showed statistically significant gains favoring the experimental group of \"intellectual bloomers\". This led to the conclusion that teacher expectations, particularly for the youngest children, can influence student achievement. Rosenthal believed that even attitude or mood could positively affect the students when the teacher was made aware of the \"bloomers\". The teacher may pay closer attention to and even treat the child differently in times of difficulty.\n\nRosenthal predicted that elementary school teachers may subconsciously behave in ways that facilitate and encourage the students' success. When finished, Rosenthal theorized that future studies could be implemented to find teachers who would encourage their students naturally without changing their teaching methods. The prior research that motivated this study was done in 1911 by psychologists regarding the case of Clever Hans, a horse that gained notoriety because it was supposed to be able to read, spell, and solve math problems by using its hoof to answer. Many skeptics suggested that questioners and observers were unintentionally signaling Clever Hans. For instance, whenever Clever Hans was asked a question the observers' demeanor usually elicited a certain behavior from the subject that in turn confirmed their expectations. For example, Clever Hans would be given a math problem to solve, and the audience would get very tense the closer he tapped his foot to the right number, thus giving Hans the clue he needed to tap the correct number of times.\n\nTeachers are also affected by the children in the classroom. Teachers reflect what is projected into them by their students. An experiment done by Jenkins and Deno (1969) submitted teachers to a classroom of children who had either been told to be attentive, or unattentive, to the teachers' lecture. They found that teachers who were in the attentive condition would rate their teaching skills as higher. Similar findings by Herrell (1971) stated that when a teacher was preconditioned to classrooms as warm or cold, the teacher would start to gravitate towards their precondition. To further this concept, Klein (1971) did the same kind of study involving teachers still unaware of any precondition to the classroom but with the class full of confederates who were instructed to act differently during periods over the course of the lecture. \"Klein reported that there was little difference between students' behaviors in the natural and the positive conditions.\" In a more observational study designed to remove the likes of the Hawthorne effect, Oppenlander (1969) studied the top and bottom 20% of students in the sixth grade from a school that tracks and organizes its students under such criteria.\n\nSoon after \"Pygmalion\"'s publication, Robert L. Thorndike, an educational psychologist, criticized the study and demonstrated that the instrument used to assess the children's IQ scores was seriously flawed. For example, the average reasoning IQ score for the children in one regular class was in the retarded range, which, given the circumstances, is impossible. In the end, Thorndike wrote the Pygmalion study's findings were worthless. He summarized his evaluation of the instrument this way: \"When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is not only cast on the last stroke but also on all that have come before...When the clock strikes 14, we throw away the clock.\" Rosenthal countered that \"even if the initial test results were faulty, that didn’t invalidate the subsequent increase, as measured by the same test,\" although with initial IQ scores in the retarded range the observed change at the conclusion of the study is more likely to reflect regression-to-the-mean effects than the effect of teacher expectations.\n\nA major limitation has also been the lack of replication. \"Most studies using product measures found no expectancy advantage for the experimental group, but most studies using process measures did show teachers to be treating the experimental group more favorably or appropriately than they were treating the control group...because teachers did not adopt the expectations that the experimenters were attempting to induce, and/or because the teachers were aware of the nature of the experiment.\" A meta-analysis indicates that the magnitude of the effect of inducing IQ-related expectancies in teachers is reduced by the amount of time teachers have spent getting to know their students prior to expectancy induction: When teachers have gotten to know their students for more than two weeks prior to expectancy induction, the impact of expectancy induction is virtually zero.\n\nLeader expectations of the employee may alter leader behavior. This behavior that is expressed toward an employee can affect the behaviors of the employee in favor of the leader's expectations. The more an employee is engaged in learning activities, the higher the expectation is from the leader. In turn, the employee participates in more learning behavior. Leaders will show more leader behaviors such as leader-member exchange (trust, respect, obligation, etc.), setting specific goals, and allowing for more learning opportunities for employees, and giving employees feedback. These factors were brought about by Rosenthal's model of the Pygmalion effect.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1607411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1607411", "title": "Republic (Plato)", "text": "Republic (Plato)\n\nThe Republic (, Politeia; Latin: Res Publica) is a Socratic dialogue, written by Plato around 380 BC, concerning justice (), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work, and has proven to be one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically.\n\nIn the dialogue, Socrates discusses with various Athenians and foreigners about the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man. They consider the natures of existing regimes and then propose a series of different, hypothetical cities in comparison, culminating in Kallipolis (Καλλίπολις), a city-state ruled by a philosopher king. They also discuss the theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the role of the philosopher and of poetry in society. The dialog's setting seems to be during the Peloponnesian War.\n\nWhile visiting the Piraeus with Glaucon, Polemarchus asks Socrates to join him for a celebration. Socrates then asks Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is \"the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies.\" Thrasymachus proclaims \"justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger.\" Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in aporia concerning its essence.\n\nSocrates believes he has answered Thrasymachus and is done with the discussion of justice.\n\nSocrates' young companions, Glaucon and Adeimantus, continue the argument of Thrasymachus for the sake of furthering the discussion. Glaucon gives a speech in which he argues first that the origin of justice was in social contracts aimed at preventing one from suffering injustice and being unable to take revenge, second that all those who practice justice do so unwillingly and out of fear of punishment, and third that the life of the unjust man is far more blessed than that of the just man. Glaucon would like Socrates to prove that justice is not only desirable, but that it belongs to the highest class of desirable things: those desired both for their own sake and their consequences.\n\nAfter Glaucon's speech, Adeimantus adds that, in this thought experiment, the unjust should not fear any sort of divine judgement in the afterlife, since the very poets who wrote about such judgement also wrote that the gods would grant forgiveness to those humans who made ample religious sacrifice. Adeimantus demonstrates his reason by drawing two detailed portraits, that the unjust man could grow wealthy by injustice, devoting a percentage of this gain to religious sacrifices, thus rendering him innocent in the eyes of the gods.\n\nSocrates suggests that they look for justice in a city rather than in an individual man. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, they go on to describe the development of the city. Socrates first describes the \"healthy state\", but Glaucon asks him to describe \"a city of pigs\", as he finds little difference between the two. He then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls \"a fevered state\". This requires a guardian class to defend and attack on its account. This begins a discussion concerning the type of education that ought to be given to these guardians in their early years, including the topic of what kind of stories are appropriate. They conclude that stories that ascribe evil to the gods are untrue and should not be taught.\n\nSocrates and his companions Adeimantus and Glaucon conclude their discussion concerning education. Socrates breaks the educational system into two. They suggest that guardians should be educated in these four virtues: wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. They also suggest that the second part of the guardians' education should be in gymnastics. With physical training they will be able to live without needing frequent medical attention: physical training will help prevent illness and weakness. Socrates asserts that both male and female guardians be given the same education, that all wives and children be shared, and that they be prohibited from owning private property.\n\nSocrates and his companions conclude their discussion concerning the lifestyle of the guardians, thus concluding their initial assessment of the city as a whole. Socrates assumes each person will be happy engaging in the occupation that suits them best. If the city as a whole is happy, then individuals are happy. In the physical education and diet of the guardians, the emphasis is on moderation, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them (422a1). Without controlling their education, the city cannot control the future rulers. Socrates says that it is pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness (425a-425c).\n\nSocrates proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains (427e). They find wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors (or auxiliaries), temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes (433b). \n\nThe virtues discovered in the city are then sought in the individual soul. For this purpose, Socrates creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul (the city-soul analogy). He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect (436b). He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, “spirited,” and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. \n\nHaving established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that knows “what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,” courageous if his spirited part “preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains” the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead (442c-d). They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one doesn’t have the other cardinal virtues.\n\nSocrates, having to his satisfaction defined the just constitution of both city and psyche, moves to elaborate upon the four unjust constitutions of these. Adeimantus and Polemarchus interrupt, asking Socrates instead first to explain how the sharing of wives and children in the guardian class is to be defined and legislated, a theme first touched on in Book III. Socrates is overwhelmed at their request, categorizing it as three \"waves\" of attack against which his reasoning must stand firm. These three waves challenge Socrates' claims that \n\n\nSocrates' argument is that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of The Good. Just as visible objects must be illuminated in order to be seen, so must also be true of objects of knowledge if light is cast on them. Just as light comes from the Sun, so does truth come from goodness. Goodness as the source of truth makes it possible for the mind to know, just as light from the Sun makes the eyes able to see.\n\nSocrates elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogies of the Sun and of the Divided Line in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he insists that the psyche must be freed from bondage to the visible/sensible world by making the painful journey into the intelligible world. He continues in the rest of this book by further elaborating upon the curriculum which a would-be philosopher-king must study. This is the origin of the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.\n\nNext, they elaborate on the education of the philosopher king. Until age 18, would-be guardians should be engaged in basic intellectual study and physical training, followed by two years of military training. However, a correction is then introduced where the study of gymnastics (martial arts) and warfare - 3 plus 2 years, respectively - are supplanted by philosophy for 5 years instead. Next, they receive ten years of mathematics until age 30, and then five years of dialectic training. Guardians then spend the next 15 years as leaders, trying to \"lead people from the cave\". (This refers to \"the Allegory of the Cave\") Upon reaching 50, they are fully aware of the form of good, and totally mature and ready to lead.\n\nSocrates discusses four unjust constitutions: timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. He argues that a society will decay and pass through each government in succession, eventually becoming a tyranny, the most unjust regime of all.\n\nThe starting point is an imagined, alternate aristocracy (ruled by a philosopher-king); a just government dominated by the wisdom-loving element. When its social structure breaks down and enters civil war, it is replaced by timocracy. The timocratic government is dominated by the spirited element, with a ruling class of property-owners consisting of warriors or generals (Ancient Sparta is an example). As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. The gap between rich and poor widens, culminating in a revolt by the underclass majority, establishing a democracy. Democracy emphasizes maximum freedom, so power is distributed evenly. It is also dominated by the desiring element, but in an undisciplined, unrestrained way. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power (since they pose a threat), while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.\n\nIn parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes. He describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all.\n\nHaving discussed the tyrannical constitution of a city, Socrates wishes to discuss the tyrannical constitution of a psyche. This is all intended to answer Thrasymachus' first argument in Book I, that the life of the unjust man (here understood as a true tyrant) is more blessed than that of the just man (the philosopher-king).\n\nFirst, he describes how a tyrannical man develops from a democratic household. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.\n\nBecause of this, tyranny is the regime with the least freedom and happiness, and the tyrant is most unhappy of all, since the regime and soul correspond. His desires are never fulfilled, and he always must live in fear of his victims. Because the tyrant can only think in terms of servant and master, he has no equals whom he can befriend, and with no friends the tyrant is robbed of freedom. This is the first proof that it is better to be just than unjust. The second proof is derived from the tripartite theory of soul. The wisdom-loving soul is best equipped to judge what is best through reason, and the wise individual judges wisdom to be best, then honor, then desire. This is the just proportion for the city or soul and stands opposite to tyranny, which is entirely satiated on base desires. The third proof follows from this. He describes how the soul can be misled into experiencing false pleasure: for example, a lack of pain can seem pleasurable by comparison to a worse state. True pleasure is had by being fulfilled by things that fit one's nature. Wisdom is the most fulfilling and is the best guide, so the only way for the three drives of the soul to function properly and experience the truest pleasure is by allowing wisdom to lead. To conclude the third proof, the wisdom element is best at providing pleasure, while tyranny is worst because it is furthest removed from wisdom.\n\nFinally, Socrates considers the multiple of how much worse tyranny is than the kingly/disciplined/wise temperament, and even quantifies the tyrant as living 729 times more painfully/less joyfully than the king. He then gives the example of a chimera to further illustrate justice and the tripartite soul.\n\nThe discussion concludes by refuting Thrasymachus' argument and designating the most blessed life as that of the just man and the most miserable life as that of the unjust man.\n\nConcluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. \n\"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\"\n\n\"And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenous devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic.\"\n\nHe speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.\n\n\"And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.\"\n\nWith all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.\n\n\"Quite true, he said. \nAnd the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.\"\n\nSometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.\n\nThree interpretations of the \"Republic\" are presented in the following section; they are not exhaustive in their treatments of the work, but are examples of contemporary interpretation.\n\nIn his \"A History of Western Philosophy\" (1945), Bertrand Russell identifies three parts to the \"Republic\":\n\nThe core of the second part is the Allegory of the Cave and the discussion of the theory of ideal forms. The third part concerns the Five Regimes and is strongly related to the later dialogue \"The Laws\"; and the Myth of Er.\n\nFrancis Cornford, , and Eric Voegelin contributed to an establishment of sub-divisions marked with special formulae in Greek:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paradigm of the city—the idea of the Good, the \"Agathon\"—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the \"Republic\", Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the allegory of the cave, which is clarified in the theory of forms. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered \"polis\" (City). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially communistic \"polis\". Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.\n\nIn part II, the \"Embodiment of the Idea\", is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a \"polis\" (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the \"paradigm\", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.\n\nThe introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the \"Republic\". The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: \"Is justice better than injustice?\" and \"Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?\" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: \"Justice is preferable to injustice\". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the \"Prologue\" (Book I) and the \"Epilogue\" (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public \"doxai\" (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the \"Epilogue\" describes the new arts and the immortality of the soul.\n\nLeo Strauss identified a four-part structure to the \"Republic\", perceiving the dialogues as a drama enacted by particular characters, each with a particular perspective and level of intellect:\n\nIn the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate. Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are commonsense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a definition. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a commonsense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.\n\nAt the end of Book I, Socrates agrees with Polemarchus that justice includes helping friends, but says the just man would never do harm to anybody. Thrasymachus believes that Socrates has done the men present an injustice by saying this and attacks his character and reputation in front of the group, partly because he suspects that Socrates himself does not even believe harming enemies is unjust. Thrasymachus gives his understanding of justice and injustice as \"justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage\". Socrates finds this definition unclear and begins to question Thrasymachus. Socrates then asks whether the ruler who makes a mistake by making a law that lessens their well-being, is still a ruler according to that definition. Thrasymachus agrees that no true ruler would make such an error. This agreement allows Socrates to undermine Thrasymachus' strict definition of justice by comparing rulers to people of various professions. Thrasymachus consents to Socrates' assertion that an artist is someone who does his job well, and is a knower of some art, which allows him to complete the job well. In so doing Socrates gets Thrasymachus to admit that rulers who enact a law that does not benefit them firstly, are in the precise sense \"not\" rulers. Thrasymachus gives up, and is silent from then on. Socrates has trapped Thrasymachus into admitting the strong man who makes a mistake is not the strong man in the precise sense, and that some type of knowledge is required to rule perfectly. However, it is far from a satisfactory definition of justice.\n\nAt the beginning of Book II, Plato's two brothers challenge Socrates to define justice in the man, and unlike the rather short and simple definitions offered in Book I, their views of justice are presented in two independent speeches. Glaucon's speech reprises Thrasymachus' idea of justice; it starts with the legend of Gyges, who discovered a ring that gave him the power to become invisible. Glaucon uses this story to argue that no man would be just if he had the opportunity of doing injustice with impunity. With the power to become invisible, Gyges is able to seduce the queen, murder the king, and take over the kingdom. Glaucon argues that the just as well as the unjust man would do the same if they had the power to get away with injustice exempt from punishment. The only reason that men are just and praise justice is out of fear of being punished for injustice. The law is a product of compromise between individuals who agree not to do injustice to others if others will not do injustice to them. Glaucon says that if people had the power to do injustice without fear of punishment, they would not enter into such an agreement. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the unjust life is better than the just life. Adeimantus adds to Glaucon's speech the charge that men are only just for the results that justice brings one fortune, honor, reputation. Adeimantus challenges Socrates to prove that being just is worth something in and of itself, not only as a means to an end.\n\nSocrates says that there is no better topic to debate. In response to the two views of injustice and justice presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus, he claims incompetence, but feels it would be impious to leave justice in such doubt. Thus the \"Republic\" sets out to define justice. Given the difficulty of this task as proven in Book I, Socrates in Book II leads his interlocutors into a discussion of justice in the city, which Socrates suggests may help them see justice not only in the person, but on a larger scale, \"first in cities searching for what it is; then thusly we could examine also in some individual, examining the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler\" (368e–369a).\n\nFor over two and a half millennia, scholars have differed on the aptness of the city-soul analogy Socrates uses to find justice in Books II through V. The \"Republic\" is a dramatic dialogue, not a treatise. Socrates' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated, only versions of justice within each city are \"found\" and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created. He builds a series of myths, or noble lies, to make the cities appear just, and these conditions moderate life within the communities. The \"earth born\" myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins. Accordingly, Socrates defines justice as \"working at that which he is naturally best suited\", and \"to do one's own business and not to be a busybody\" (433a–433b) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three cardinal virtues: Temperance, Wisdom, and Courage, and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence. Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city, suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either, rather it is the result of a \"well ordered\" soul. A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types; that of the soldier, that of the producer, and that of a ruler. If a ruler can create just laws, and if the warriors can carry out the orders of the rulers, and if the producers can obey this authority, then a society will be just.\n\nThe city is challenged by Adeimantus and Glaucon throughout its development: Adeimantus cannot find happiness in the city, and Glaucon cannot find honor and glory. This hypothetical city contains no private property, no marriage, or nuclear families. These are sacrificed for the common good and doing what is best fitting to one's nature. In Book V Socrates addresses the question of \"natural-ness\" of and possibility for this city, concluding in Book VI, that the city's ontological status regards a construction of the soul, not of an actual metropolis.\n\nThe rule of philosopher-kings appear as the issue of possibility is raised. Socrates never positively states what justice is in the human soul/city; it appears he has created a city where justice is not found, but can be lost. It is as though in a well-ordered state, justice is not even needed, since the community satisfies the needs of humans.\n\nIn terms of why it is best to be just rather than unjust for the individual, Plato prepares an answer in Book IX consisting of three main arguments. Plato says that a tyrant's nature will leave him with \"horrid pains and pangs\" and that the typical tyrant engages in a lifestyle that will be physically and mentally exacting on such a ruler. Such a disposition is in contrast to the truth-loving philosopher king, and a tyrant \"never tastes of true freedom or friendship\". The second argument proposes that of all the different types of people, only the philosopher is able to judge which type of ruler is best since only he can see the Form of the Good. Thirdly, Plato argues, \"Pleasures which are approved of by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\" In sum, Plato argues that philosophical pleasure is the only true pleasure since other pleasures experienced by others are simply a neutral state free of pain.\n\nSocrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This \"good city\" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The paradigmatic society which stands behind every historical society is hierarchical, but social classes have a marginal permeability; there are no slaves, no discrimination between men and women. The men and women are both to be taught the same things, so they are both able to be used for the same things (451e). In addition to the ruling class of guardians (φύλακες), which abolished riches, there is a class of private producers (demiourgoi), who may be rich or poor. A number of provisions aim to avoid making the people weak: the substitution of a universal educational system for men and women instead of debilitating music, poetry and theatre—a startling departure from Greek society. These provisions apply to all classes, and the restrictions placed on the philosopher-kings chosen from the warrior class and the warriors are much more severe than those placed on the producers, because the rulers must be kept away from any source of corruption.\n\nIn Books V-VI the abolition of riches among the guardian class (not unlike Max Weber's bureaucracy) leads controversially to the abandonment of the typical family, and as such no child may know his or her parents and the parents may not know their own children. Socrates tells a tale which is the \"allegory of the good government\". The rulers assemble couples for reproduction, based on breeding criteria. Thus, stable population is achieved through eugenics and social cohesion is projected to be high because familial links are extended towards everyone in the city. Also the education of the youth is such that they are taught of only works of writing that encourage them to improve themselves for the state's good, and envision (the) god(s) as entirely good, just, and the author(s) of only that which is good.\n\nIn Books VII-X stand Plato's criticism of the forms of government. It begins with the dismissal of timocracy, a sort of authoritarian regime, not unlike a military dictatorship. Plato offers an almost psychoanalytical explanation of the \"timocrat\" as one who saw his father humiliated by his mother and wants to vindicate \"manliness\". The third worst regime is oligarchy, the rule of a small band of rich people, millionaires that only respect money. Then comes the democratic form of government, and its susceptibility to being ruled by unfit \"sectarian\" demagogues. Finally the worst regime is tyranny, where the whimsical desires of the ruler became law and there is no check upon arbitrariness.\n\nThe \"Republic\" contains Plato's \"Allegory of the cave\" with which he explains his concept of The Forms as an answer to the problem of universals.\n\nThe allegory of the cave primarily depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms, as well as helping to justify the philosopher's place in society as king. Plato imagines a group of people who have lived their entire lives as prisoners, chained to the wall of a cave in the subterranean so they are unable to see the outside world behind them. However a constant flame illuminates various moving objects outside, which are silhouetted on the wall of the cave visible to the prisoners. These prisoners, through having no other experience of reality, ascribe forms to these shadows such as either \"dog\" or \"cat\".\n\nPlato then goes on to explain how the philosopher is akin to a prisoner who is freed from the cave. The prisoner is initially blinded by the light, but when he adjusts to the brightness he sees the fire and the statues and how they caused the images witnessed inside the cave. He sees that the fire and statues in the cave were just copies of the real objects; merely imitations. This is analogous to the Forms. What we see from day to day are merely appearances, reflections of the Forms. The philosopher, however, will not be deceived by the shadows and will hence be able to see the 'real' world, the world above that of appearances; the philosopher will gain knowledge of things in themselves. In this analogy the sun is representative of the Good. This is the main object of the philosopher's knowledge. The Good can be thought of as the form of Forms, or the structuring of the world as a whole.\n\nThe prisoner's stages of understanding correlate with the levels on the divided line which he imagines. The line is divided into what the visible world is and what the intelligible world is, with the divider being the Sun. When the prisoner is in the cave, he is obviously in the visible realm that receives no sunlight, and outside he comes to be in the intelligible realm.\n\nThe shadows witnessed in the cave correspond to the lowest level on Plato's line, that of imagination and conjecture. Once the prisoner is freed and sees the shadows for what they are he reaches the second stage on the divided line, the stage of belief, for he comes to believe that the statues in the cave are real. On leaving the cave, however, the prisoner comes to see objects more real than the statues inside of the cave, and this correlates with the third stage on Plato's line, thought. Lastly, the prisoner turns to the sun which he grasps as the source of truth, or the Form of the Good, and this last stage, named as dialectic, is the highest possible stage on the line. The prisoner, as a result of the Form of the Good, can begin to understand all other forms in reality.\n\nAt the end of this allegory, Plato asserts that it is the philosopher's burden to reenter the cave. Those who have seen the ideal world, he says, have the duty to educate those in the material world. Since the philosopher recognizes what is truly good only he is fit to rule society according to Plato.\n\nWhile Plato spends much of the \"Republic\" having Socrates narrate a conversation about the city he founds with Glaucon and Adeimantus \"in speech\", the discussion eventually turns to considering four regimes that exist in reality and tend to degrade successively into each other: timocracy, oligarchy (also called plutocracy), democracy and tyranny (also called despotism).\n\nTimocracy\n\nSocrates defines a timocracy as a government of people who love rule and honor. Socrates argues that the timocracy emerges from aristocracy due to a civil war breaking out among the ruling class and the majority. Over time, many more births will occur to people who lack aristocratic, guardian qualities, slowly drawing the populace away from knowledge, music, poetry and \"guardian education\", toward money-making and the acquisition of possessions. This civil war between those who value wisdom and those who value material acquisition will continue until a compromise is reached. The timocracy values war insofar as it satisfies a love of victory and honor. The timocratic man loves physical training, and hunting, and values his abilities in warfare.\n\nOligarchy\n\nTemptations create a confusion between economic status and honor which is responsible for the emergence of oligarchy. In Book VIII, Socrates suggests that wealth will not help a pilot to navigate his ship, as his concerns will be directed centrally toward increasing his wealth by whatever means, rather than seeking out wisdom or honor. The injustice of economic disparity divides the rich and the poor, thus creating an environment for criminals and beggars to emerge. The rich are constantly plotting against the poor and vice versa. The oligarchic constitution is based on property assessment and wealth qualification. Unlike the timocracy, oligarchs are also unable to fight war, since they do not wish to arm the majority for fear of their rising up against them (fearing the majority even more than their enemies), nor do they seem to pay mercenaries, since they are reluctant to spend money.\n\nDemocracy\n\nAs this socioeconomic divide grows, so do tensions between social classes. From the conflicts arising out of such tensions, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and democracy replaces the oligarchy preceding it. The poor overthrow the oligarchs and grant liberties and freedoms to citizens, creating a most variegated collection of peoples under a \"supermarket\" of constitutions. A visually appealing demagogue is soon lifted up to protect the interests of the lower class. However, with too much freedom, no requirements for anyone to rule, and having no interest in assessing the background of their rulers (other than honoring such people because they wish the majority well) the people become easily persuaded by such a demagogue's appeal to try and satisfy people's common, base, and unnecessary pleasures.\n\nTyranny\n\nThe excessive freedoms granted to the citizens of a democracy ultimately leads to a tyranny, the furthest regressed type of government. These freedoms divide the people into three socioeconomic classes: the dominating class, the elites and the commoners. Tensions between the dominating class and the elites cause the commoners to seek out protection of their democratic liberties. They invest all their power in their democratic demagogue, who, in turn, becomes corrupted by the power and becomes a tyrant with a small entourage of his supporters for protection and absolute control of his people.\n\nThe idea of writing treatises on systems of government was followed some decades later by Plato's most prominent pupil Aristotle, whose \"Politika\" systematises many of Plato's concepts, in some cases differing from his conclusions.\n\nIt has been suggested that Isocrates parodies the \"Republic\" in his work \"Busiris\" by showing Callipolis' similarity to the Egyptian state founded by a king of that name.\n\nZeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, wrote his own imitation of Plato's \"Republic\", c. 300 BC. \"Zeno's Republic\" advocates a form of anarchism in which all of the citizens are philosophers, and advocates a more radical form of sexual communism than that proposed by Plato.\n\nThe English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from Cicero's \"De re publica\", written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character Scipio Africanus expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.\n\n\"Res publica\" is not an exact translation of Plato's Greek title \"politeia\". Rather, \"politeia\" is a general term for the actual and potential forms of government for a \"Polis\" or city-state, and Plato attempts to survey all possible forms of the state. Cicero's discussion is more parochial, focusing on the improvement of the participants' own state, the Roman Republic in its final stages.\n\nIn antiquity, Plato's works were largely acclaimed, but a few commentators regarded them as too theoretical. Tacitus, commented on such works as \"The Republic\" and Aristotle's \"Politics\" in his \"Ann.\" (IV, 33):\n\nIn this work, Tacitus undertakes the prosaic description and minute analysis of how real states are governed, attempting to derive more practical lessons about good versus bad governance than can be deduced from speculations on ideal governments.\n\nIn the pivotal era of Rome's move from its ancient polytheist religion to Christianity, Augustine wrote his magnum opus \"The City of God\": Again, the references to Plato, Aristotle and Cicero and their visions of the ideal state were legion: Augustine equally described a model of the \"ideal city\", in his case the eternal Jerusalem, using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.\n\nIslamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's \"Politics\", Ibn Rushd (Averroes) produced instead a commentary on\nPlato's \"Republic\". He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion, although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised. Rhetoric, not logic, is the appropriate road to truth for the common man. Demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study. Rhetoric aids religion in reaching the masses.\n\nFollowing Plato, Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers. He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.\n\nHegel respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau, whose theories proceeded from a fictional \"state of nature\" defined by humanity's \"natural\" needs, desires and freedom. For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history. Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature. Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:\n\nFor Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:\n\nGreece being at a crossroads, Plato's new \"constitution\" in the \"Republic\" was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.\n\nIn his 1934 \"Plato und die Dichter\" (\"Plato and the Poets\"), as well as several other works, Hans-Georg Gadamer describes the utopic city of the \"Republic\" as a heuristic utopia that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are ironic, a line of thought initially pursued by Kierkegaard.\n\nThe city portrayed in the \"Republic\" struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as totalitarian. Karl Popper gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper divorced Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the humanitarian and democratic tendencies of his teacher. In particular, Popper accuses Plato of betraying Socrates. Gilbert Ryle, reviewing Popper's text just two years after its publication and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato \"was Socrates' Judas.\" Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as \"human cattle\"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolving of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as \"keeping one's place\".\n\nEric Voegelin in \"Plato and Aristotle\" (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II-V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that Socrates himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of knowledge. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of social mobility. The exercise of power is built on the 'noble lie' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no family among the guardians, another crude version of Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.\n\nSome of Plato's proposals have led theorists like Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom to ask readers to consider the possibility that Socrates was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the \"Just City in Speech\" that seem contradictory, which raise the possibility Socrates is employing irony to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, Plato has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the \"Republic\".\n\nOne of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class 'sacred'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.\n\nLeo Strauss's approach developed out of a belief that Plato wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the exoteric-esoteric distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the \"Just City in Speech\" of Books V-VI come to pass, or whether it is just an allegory. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing Cicero's opinion that the \"Republic's\" true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things. In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the \"Just City in Speech\" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the \"Republic\" \"is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros\".\n\nAn argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that Plato's Academy produced a number of tyrants who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea; Chaeron, tyrant of Pellene; Erastus and Coriscus, tyrants of Skepsis; Hermias of Atarneus and Assos; and Calippus, tyrant of Syracuse ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became \"tyrants\" through studying in the Academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, totalitarian sense of the concept. Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.\n\nMany critics, both ancient and modern (like Julia Annas), have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different \"members\" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive \"government.\" Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. In a definitive treatment of the subject, Blössner (2007) presents and argues for the case that the \"Republic\" is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the \"Republic\" as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.\n\nThe above-mentioned views have in common that they view the \"Republic\" as a theoretical work, not as a set of guidelines for good governance. However, Popper insists that the Republic, \"was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto\" and Bertrand Russell argues that at least in \"intent\", and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the \"Republic\" was meant as a practical one by Plato.\n\nOne of Plato's recurring techniques in the \"Republic\" is to refine the concept of justice with reference to various examples of greater or lesser injustice. However, in \"The Concept of Injustice\", Eric Heinze challenges the assumption that 'justice' and 'injustice' form a mutually exclusive pair. Heinze argues that such an assumption traces not from strict deductive logic, but from the arbitrary etymology of the word 'injustice'. Heinze critiques what he calls 'classical' Western justice theory for having perpetuated that logical error, which first appears in Plato's \"Republic\", but manifests throughout traditional political philosophy, in thinkers otherwise as different as Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel and Marx.\n\nIn 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the \"Republic\" the greatest philosophical text ever written. Julian Baggini argued that although the work \"was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it.\"\n\nIn fiction, Jo Walton's 2015 novel \"The Just City\" explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the \"Republic\" in practice.\n\nThe \"Republic\" is generally placed in the \"middle period\" of Plato's dialogues—that is, it is believed to be written after the \"early period\" dialogues but before the \"late period\" dialogues. However, the distinction of this group from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others. Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—with their separate methodologies—all agreed that the \"Republic\" was well distinguished, along with \"Parmenides\", \"Phaedrus\" and \"Theaetetus\".\n\nHowever, the first book of the \"Republic\", which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.\n\nSeveral Oxyrhynchus Papyri fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as Phaedo, or the dialogue Gorgias, written around 200-300 CE. Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the Nag Hammadi library, written ca. 350 CE. These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.\n\n\n\n"}

Then, to a given time formula_1, there corresponds uniquely an formula_9, such that:\n\nThe residual time (or excess time) is given by the time formula_11 from formula_1 to the next renewal epoch.\n\nLet the cumulative distribution function of the holding times formula_3 be formula_15 and recall that the renewal function of a process is formula_16. Then, for a given time formula_1, the cumulative distribution function of formula_11 is calculated as:\n\nDifferentiating with respect to formula_20, the probability density function can be written as \n\nwhere we have substituted formula_22 From elementary renewal theorem formula_23 as formula_24. If we consider the limiting distribution as formula_24, assuming that formula_26 as formula_24, we have the limiting pdf as\n\nwhere formula_29 is the mean of the distribution formula_30. Likewise, the cumulative distribution of the residual time is \n\nFor large formula_1, the distribution is independent of formula_1, making it a stationary distribution. An interesting fact is that the limiting distribution of forward recurrence time (or residual time) has the same form as the limiting distribution of the backward recurrence time (or age). This distribution is always J-shaped, with mode at zero.\n\nThe first two moments of this limiting distribution formula_34 are:\n\nwhere formula_37 is the variance of formula_30 and formula_39 and formula_40 are its second and third moments. \n\nThe fact that formula_41 is also known variously as the waiting time paradox, inspection paradox, or the paradox of renewal theory. The paradox arises from the fact that the average waiting time for to the next renewal, assuming that the reference time point formula_1 is uniform randomly selected within the inter-renewal interval, is larger than the average inter-renewal interval formula_43. The average waiting is formula_44 only when formula_45, that is when the renewals are always punctual or deterministic.\n\nWhen the holding times formula_3 are exponentially distributed with formula_47, the residual times are also exponentially distributed. That is because formula_48 and:\n\nThis is a known characteristic of the exponential distribution, i.e., its memoryless property. Intuitively, this means that it does not matter how long it has been since the last renewal epoch, the remaining time is still probabilistically the same as in the beginning of the holding time interval.\n\nRenewal theory texts usually also define the spent time or the backward recurrence time (or the current lifetime) as formula_50. Its distribution can be calculated in a similar way to that of the residual time. Likewise, the total life time is the sum of backward recurrence time and forward recurrence time.\n\n"}

The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience, cognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The nervous system has a specific sensory nervous system, and a sense organ, or sensor, dedicated to each sense.\n\nHumans have a multitude of sensors. Sight (vision), hearing (audition), taste (gustation), smell (olfaction), and touch (somatosensation) are the five traditionally recognized senses. The ability to detect other stimuli beyond those governed by these most broadly recognized senses also exists, and these sensory modalities include temperature (thermoception), kinesthetic sense (proprioception), pain (nociception), balance (equilibrioception), vibration (mechanoreception), and various internal stimuli (e.g. the different chemoreceptors for detecting salt and carbon dioxide concentrations in the blood, or sense of hunger and sense of thirst). However, what constitutes a sense is a matter of some debate, leading to difficulties in defining what exactly a distinct sense is, and where the borders lie between responses to related stimuli.\n\nOther animals also have receptors to sense the world around them, with degrees of capability varying greatly between species. Humans have a comparatively weak sense of smell and a stronger sense of sight relative to many other mammals while some animals may lack one or more of the traditional five senses. Some animals may also intake and interpret sensory stimuli in very different ways. Some species of animals are able to sense the world in a way that humans cannot, with some species able to sense electrical and magnetic fields, and detect water pressure and currents.\n\nA broadly acceptable definition of a sense would be \"A system that consists of a group of sensory cell types that responds to a specific physical phenomenon, and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted.\" There is no firm agreement as to the number of senses because of differing definitions of what constitutes a sense.\n\nThe senses are frequently divided into exteroceptive and interoceptive:\n\nNon-human animals may possess senses that are absent in humans, such as electroreception and detection of polarized light.\n\nIn Buddhist philosophy, Ayatana or \"sense-base\" includes the mind as a sense organ, in addition to the traditional five. This addition to the commonly acknowledged senses may arise from the psychological orientation involved in Buddhist thought and practice. The mind considered by itself is seen as the principal gateway to a different spectrum of phenomena that differ from the physical sense data. This way of viewing the human sense system indicates the importance of internal sources of sensation and perception that complements our experience of the external world.\n\nSight or vision (adjectival form: visual/optical) is the capability of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible light on photoreceptors in the retina of each eye that generates electrical nerve impulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are very sensitive to light, but do not distinguish colors. Cones distinguish colors, but are less sensitive to dim light. There is some disagreement as to whether this constitutes one, two or three senses. Neuroanatomists generally regard it as two senses, given that different receptors are responsible for the perception of color and brightness. Some argue that stereopsis, the perception of depth using both eyes, also constitutes a sense, but it is generally regarded as a cognitive (that is, post-sensory) function of the visual cortex of the brain where patterns and objects in images are recognized and interpreted based on previously learned information. This is called visual memory.\n\nThe inability to see is called blindness. Blindness may result from damage to the eyeball, especially to the retina, damage to the optic nerve that connects each eye to the brain, and/or from stroke (infarcts in the brain). Temporary or permanent blindness can be caused by poisons or medications.\n\nPeople who are blind from degradation or damage to the visual cortex, but still have functional eyes, are actually capable of some level of vision and reaction to visual stimuli but not a conscious perception; this is known as blindsight. People with blindsight are usually not aware that they are reacting to visual sources, and instead just unconsciously adapt their behaviour to the stimulus.\n\nOn February 14, 2013 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.\n\nHearing or audition (adjectival form: auditory) is the sense of sound perception. Hearing is all about vibration. Mechanoreceptors turn motion into electrical nerve pulses, which are located in the inner ear. Since sound is vibration, propagating through a medium such as air, the detection of these vibrations, that is the sense of the hearing, is a mechanical sense because these vibrations are mechanically conducted from the eardrum through a series of tiny bones to hair-like fibers in the inner ear, which detect mechanical motion of the fibers within a range of about 20 to 20,000 hertz, with substantial variation between individuals. Hearing at high frequencies declines with an increase in age. Inability to hear is called deafness or hearing impairment. Sound can also be detected as vibrations conducted through the body by tactition. Lower frequencies that can be heard are detected this way. Some deaf people are able to determine direction and location of vibrations picked up through the feet.\n\nTaste or gustation (adjectival form: gustatory) is one of the traditional five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. The sense of taste is often confused with the \"sense\" of flavor, which is a combination of taste and smell perception. Flavor depends on odor, texture, and temperature as well as on taste. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs called taste buds, or gustatory calyculi, concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue. There are five basic tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, salty and umami. Other tastes such as calcium and free fatty acids may also be basic tastes but have yet to receive widespread acceptance. The inability to taste is called ageusia.\n\nSmell or olfaction (adjectival form: olfactory) is the other \"chemical\" sense. Unlike taste, there are hundreds of olfactory receptors (388 according to one source), each binding to a particular molecular feature. Odor molecules possess a variety of features and, thus, excite specific receptors more or less strongly. This combination of excitatory signals from different receptors makes up what we perceive as the molecule's smell. In the brain, olfaction is processed by the olfactory system. Olfactory receptor neurons in the nose differ from most other neurons in that they die and regenerate on a regular basis. The inability to smell is called anosmia. Some neurons in the nose are specialized to detect pheromones.\n\nTouch or somatosensation (adjectival form: somatic), also called tactition (adjectival form: tactile) or mechanoreception, is a perception resulting from activation of neural receptors, generally in the skin including hair follicles, but also in the tongue, throat, and mucosa. A variety of pressure receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of itching caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord. The loss or impairment of the ability to feel anything touched is called tactile anesthesia. Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin that may result from nerve damage and may be permanent or temporary.\n\nBalance, equilibrioception, or vestibular sense is the sense that allows an organism to sense body movement, direction, and acceleration, and to attain and maintain postural equilibrium and balance. The organ of equilibrioception is the vestibular labyrinthine system found in both of the inner ears. In technical terms, this organ is responsible for two senses of angular momentum acceleration and linear acceleration (which also senses gravity), but they are known together as equilibrioception.\n\nThe vestibular nerve conducts information from sensory receptors in three ampulla that sense motion of fluid in three semicircular canals caused by three-dimensional rotation of the head. The vestibular nerve also conducts information from the utricle and the saccule, which contain hair-like sensory receptors that bend under the weight of otoliths (which are small crystals of calcium carbonate) that provide the inertia needed to detect head rotation, linear acceleration, and the direction of gravitational force.\n\nThermoception is the sense of heat and the absence of heat (cold) by the skin and internal skin passages, or, rather, the heat flux (the rate of heat flow) in these areas. There are specialized receptors for cold (declining temperature) and for heat (increasing temperature). The cold receptors play an important part in the animal's sense of smell, telling wind direction. The heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in pit vipers. The thermoceptors in the skin are quite different from the homeostatic thermoceptors in the brain (hypothalamus), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.\n\nProprioception, the kinesthetic sense, provides the parietal cortex of the brain with information on the movement and relative positions of the parts of the body. Neurologists test this sense by telling patients to close their eyes and touch their own nose with the tip of a finger. Assuming proper proprioceptive function, at no time will the person lose awareness of where the hand actually is, even though it is not being detected by any of the other senses. Proprioception and touch are related in subtle ways, and their impairment results in surprising and deep deficits in perception and action.\n\nNociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. The three types of pain receptors are cutaneous (skin), somatic (joints and bones), and visceral (body organs). It was previously believed that pain was simply the overloading of pressure receptors, but research in the first half of the 20th century indicated that pain is a distinct phenomenon that intertwines with all of the other senses, including touch. Pain was once considered an entirely subjective experience, but recent studies show that pain is registered in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the brain. The main function of pain is to attract our attention to dangers and motivate us to avoid them. For example, humans avoid touching a sharp needle, or hot object, or extending an arm beyond a safe limit because it is dangerous, and thus hurts. Without pain, people could do many dangerous things without being aware of the dangers.\n\nSexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains sexual arousal, and may lead to orgasm. Distinct from the general sense of touch, sexual stimulation is strongly tied to hormonal activity and chemical triggers in the body. Although sexual arousal may arise without physical stimulation, achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation (stimulation of the Krause-Finger corpuscles found in erogenous zones of the body).\n\nAn internal sense also known as interoception is \"any sense that is normally stimulated from within the body\". These involve numerous sensory receptors in internal organs, such as stretch receptors that are neurologically linked to the brain. Interoception is thought to be atypical in clinical conditions such as alexithymia. \nSome examples of specific receptors are:\n\nChronoception refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.\n\nOne or more dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system appear to have a strong modulatory influence on mental chronometry, particularly interval timing.\n\nThe sense of agency refers to the subjective feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, can lead to a loss of this sense, causing a person to feel like a machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.\n\nEven in non-pathological cases, there is a measurable difference between making a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as the Libet experiment, a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.\n\nThere are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In Wegner and Wheatley 1999, subjects were given instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person—acting as a test subject but actually a confederate—had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement. Experimenters were able to arrange for subjects to perceive certain \"forced stops\" as if they were their own choice.\n\nRecognition memory is sometimes divided into two functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection. A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the sense of familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15 Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40 Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40 Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones—they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.\n\nOther living organisms have receptors to sense the world around them, including many of the senses listed above for humans. However, the mechanisms and capabilities vary widely.\n\nMost non-human mammals have a much keener sense of smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of smell in non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine the direction of a smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell. Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.\n\nMany animals (salamanders, reptiles, mammals) have a vomeronasal organ that is connected with the mouth cavity. In mammals it is mainly used to detect pheromones of marked territory, trails, and sexual state. Reptiles like snakes and monitor lizards make extensive use of it as a smelling organ by transferring scent molecules to the vomeronasal organ with the tips of the forked tongue. In reptiles the vomeronasal organ is commonly referred to as Jacobsons organ. In mammals, it is often associated with a special behavior called flehmen characterized by uplifting of the lips. The organ is vestigial in humans, because associated neurons have not been found that give any sensory input in humans.\n\nFlies and butterflies have taste organs on their feet, allowing them to taste anything they land on. Catfish have taste organs across their entire bodies, and can taste anything they touch, including chemicals in the water.\n\nCats have the ability to see in low light, which is due to muscles surrounding their irides–which contract and expand their pupils–as well as to the tapetum lucidum, a reflective membrane that optimizes the image.\nPit vipers, pythons and some boas have organs that allow them to detect infrared light, such that these snakes are able to sense the body heat of their prey. The common vampire bat may also have an infrared sensor on its nose. It has been found that birds and some other animals are tetrachromats and have the ability to see in the ultraviolet down to 300 nanometers. Bees and dragonflies are also able to see in the ultraviolet. Mantis shrimps can perceive both polarized light and multispectral images and have twelve distinct kinds of color receptors, unlike humans which have three kinds and most mammals which have two kinds.\n\nCephalopods have the ability to change color using chromatophores in their skin. Researchers believe that opsins in the skin can sense different wavelengths of light and help the creatures choose a coloration that camouflages them, in addition to light input from the eyes. Other researchers hypothesize that cephalopod eyes in species which only have a single photoreceptor protein may use chromatic aberration to turn monochromatic vision into color vision, explaining pupils shaped like the letter U, the letter W, or a dumbbell, as well as explaining the need for colorful mating displays. Some cephalopods can distinguish the polarization of light.\n\nMany invertebrates have a statocyst, which is a sensor for acceleration and orientation that works very differently from the mammalian's semi-circular canals.\n\nSome plants (such as mustard) have genes that are necessary for the plant to sense the direction of gravity. If these genes are disabled by a mutation, a plant cannot grow upright.\n\nIn addition, some animals have senses that humans do not, including the following:\n\nCertain animals, including bats and cetaceans, have the ability to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, a task that has proven difficult in practice.\n\nBlind people report they are able to navigate and in some cases identify an object by interpreting reflected sounds (especially their own footsteps), a phenomenon known as human echolocation.\n\nElectroreception (or electroception) is the ability to detect electric fields. Several species of fish, sharks, and rays have the capacity to sense changes in electric fields in their immediate vicinity. For cartilaginous fish this occurs through a specialized organ called the Ampullae of Lorenzini. Some fish passively sense changing nearby electric fields; some generate their own weak electric fields, and sense the pattern of field potentials over their body surface; and some use these electric field generating and sensing capacities for social communication. The mechanisms by which electroceptive fish construct a spatial representation from very small differences in field potentials involve comparisons of spike latencies from different parts of the fish's body.\n\nThe only orders of mammals that are known to demonstrate electroception are the dolphin and monotreme orders. Among these mammals, the platypus has the most acute sense of electroception.\n\nA dolphin can detect electric fields in water using electroreceptors in vibrissal crypts arrayed in pairs on its snout and which evolved from whisker motion sensors. These electroreceptors can detect electric fields as weak as 4.6 microvolts per centimeter, such as those generated by contracting muscles and pumping gills of potential prey. This permits the dolphin to locate prey from the seafloor where sediment limits visibility and echolocation.\n\nSpiders have been shown to detect electric fields to determine a suitable time to extend web for 'ballooning'.\n\nBody modification enthusiasts have experimented with magnetic implants to attempt to replicate this sense. However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the like). This is not electroreception, as it is a post-sensory cognitive action.\n\nMagnetoception (or magnetoreception) is the ability to detect the direction one is facing based on the Earth's magnetic field. Directional awareness is most commonly observed in birds, which rely on their magnetic sense to navigate during migration. It has also been observed in insects such as bees. Cattle make use of magnetoception to align themselves in a north-south direction.<ref name=\"BBC NEWS - Science/Nature\"></ref> Magnetotactic bacteria build miniature magnets inside themselves and use them to determine their orientation relative to the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nHygroreception is the ability to detect changes in the moisture content of the environment.\n\nThe ability to sense infrared thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of snakes. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to \"see\" radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm to a degree of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes. It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that it may also be used in thermoregulatory decision making. The facial pit underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons. The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril (Loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target endothermic prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain heat-sensing pits) cannot.\n\nIn spite of its detection of IR light, the pits' IR detection mechanism is not similar to photoreceptors – while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the pits of snakes is in fact a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light. This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane in order to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original \"resting\" or \"inactive\" temperature.\n\n\nBy using a variety of sense receptors, plants sense light, gravity, temperature, humidity, chemical substances, chemical gradients, reorientation, magnetic fields, infections, tissue damage and mechanical pressure. The absence of a nervous system notwithstanding, plants interpret and respond to these stimuli by a variety of hormonal and cell-to-cell communication pathways that result in movement, morphological changes and physiological state alterations at the organism level, that is, result in plant behavior. Such physiological and cognitive functions are generally not believed to give rise to mental phenomena or qualia, however, as these are typically considered the product of nervous system activity. The emergence of mental phenomena from the activity of systems functionally or computationally analogous to that of nervous systems is, however, a hypothetical possibility explored by some schools of thought in the philosophy of mind field, such as functionalism and computationalism.\n\nIn the time of William Shakespeare, there were commonly reckoned to be five wits or five senses. At that time, the words \"sense\" and \"wit\" were synonyms, so the senses were known as the five outward wits. This traditional concept of five senses is common today.\n\nThe traditional five senses are enumerated as the \"five material faculties\" (\"\") in Hindu literature. They appear in allegorical representation as early as in the Katha Upanishad (roughly 6th century BC), as five horses drawing the \"chariot\" of the body, guided by the mind as \"chariot driver\".\n\nDepictions of the five traditional senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters. A typical example is Gérard de Lairesse's \"Allegory of the Five Senses\" (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a convex mirror, hearing is the cupid-like boy with a triangle, smell is represented by the girl with flowers, taste is represented by the woman with the fruit, and touch is represented by the woman holding the bird.\n\n"}
{"id": "140841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140841", "title": "Sufficient statistic", "text": "Sufficient statistic\n\nIn statistics, a statistic is \"sufficient\" with respect to a statistical model and its associated unknown parameter if \"no other statistic that can be calculated from the same sample provides any additional information as to the value of the parameter\". In particular, a statistic is sufficient for a family of probability distributions if the sample from which it is calculated gives no additional information than does the statistic, as to which of those probability distributions is that of the population from which the sample was taken.\n\nA related concept is that of linear sufficiency, which is weaker than \"sufficiency\" but can be applied in some cases where there is no sufficient statistic, although it is restricted to linear estimators. The Kolmogorov structure function deals with individual finite data; the related notion there is the algorithmic sufficient statistic.\n\nThe concept is due to Sir Ronald Fisher in 1920. Stephen Stigler noted 1973 that the concept of sufficiency had fallen out of favor in descriptive statistics because of the strong dependence on an assumption of the distributional form (see Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem below), but remained very important in theoretical work.\n\nRoughly, given a set formula_1 of independent identically distributed data conditioned on an unknown parameter formula_2, a sufficient statistic is a function formula_3 whose value contains all the information needed to compute any estimate of the parameter (e.g. a maximum likelihood estimate). Due to the factorization theorem (see below), for a sufficient statistic formula_3, the probabilty density can be written as formula_5. From this factorization, it can easily be seen that the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_2 will interact with formula_7 only through formula_3. Typically, the sufficient statistic is a simple function of the data, e.g. the sum of all the data points.\n\nMore generally, the \"unknown parameter\" may represent a vector of unknown quantities or may represent everything about the model that is unknown or not fully specified. In such a case, the sufficient statistic may be a set of functions, called a \"jointly sufficient statistic\". Typically, there are as many functions as there are parameters. For example, for a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variance, the jointly sufficient statistic, from which maximum likelihood estimates of both parameters can be estimated, consists of two functions, the sum of all data points and the sum of all squared data points (or equivalently, the sample mean and sample variance).\n\nThe concept is equivalent to the statement that, conditional on the value of a sufficient statistic for a parameter, the joint probability distribution of the data does not depend on that parameter. Both the statistic and the underlying parameter can be vectors.\n\nA statistic \"t\" = \"T\"(\"X\") is sufficient for underlying parameter \"θ\" precisely if the conditional probability distribution of the data \"X\", given the statistic \"t\" = \"T\"(\"X\"), does not depend on the parameter \"θ\".\n\nAs an example, the sample mean is sufficient for the mean (\"μ\") of a normal distribution with known variance. Once the sample mean is known, no further information about \"μ\" can be obtained from the sample itself. On the other hand, for an arbitrary distribution the median is not sufficient for the mean: even if the median of the sample is known, knowing the sample itself would provide further information about the population mean. For example, if the observations that are less than the median are only slightly less, but observations exceeding the median exceed it by a large amount, then this would have a bearing on one's inference about the population mean.\n\n\"Fisher's factorization theorem\" or \"factorization criterion\" provides a convenient characterization of a sufficient statistic. If the probability density function is ƒ(\"x\"), then \"T\" is sufficient for \"θ\" if and only if nonnegative functions \"g\" and \"h\" can be found such that\n\ni.e. the density ƒ can be factored into a product such that one factor, \"h\", does not depend on \"θ\" and the other factor, which does depend on \"θ\", depends on \"x\" only through \"T\"(\"x\").\n\nIt is easy to see that if \"F\"(\"t\") is a one-to-one function and \"T\" is a sufficient\nstatistic, then \"F\"(\"T\") is a sufficient statistic. In particular we can multiply a\nsufficient statistic by a nonzero constant and get another sufficient statistic.\n\nAn implication of the theorem is that when using likelihood-based inference, two sets of data yielding the same value for the sufficient statistic \"T\"(\"X\") will always yield the same inferences about \"θ\". By the factorization criterion, the likelihood's dependence on \"θ\" is only in conjunction with \"T\"(\"X\"). As this is the same in both cases, the dependence on \"θ\" will be the same as well, leading to identical inferences.\n\nDue to Hogg and Craig. Let formula_10, denote a random sample from a distribution having the pdf \"f\"(\"x\", \"θ\") for \"ι\" < \"θ\" < \"δ\". Let \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", \"X\", ..., \"X\") be a statistic whose pdf is \"g\"(\"y\"; \"θ\"). Then \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", \"X\", ..., \"X\") is a sufficient statistic for \"θ\" if and only if, for some function \"H\",\n\nFirst, suppose that\n\nWe shall make the transformation \"y\" = \"u\"(\"x\", \"x\", ..., \"x\"), for \"i\" = 1, ..., \"n\", having inverse functions \"x\" = \"w\"(\"y\", \"y\", ..., \"y\"), for \"i\" = 1, ..., \"n\", and Jacobian formula_13. Thus,\n\nThe left-hand member is the joint pdf \"g\"(\"y\", \"y\", ..., \"y\"; θ) of \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", ..., \"X\"), ..., \"Y\" = \"u\"(\"X\", ..., \"X\"). In the right-hand member, formula_15 is the pdf of formula_16, so that formula_17 is the quotient of formula_18 and formula_15; that is, it is the conditional pdf formula_20 of formula_21 given formula_22.\n\nBut formula_23, and thus formula_24, was given not to depend upon formula_2. Since formula_2 was not introduced in the transformation and accordingly not in the Jacobian formula_27, it follows that formula_28 does not depend upon formula_2 and that formula_16 is a sufficient statistics for formula_2.\n\nThe converse is proven by taking:\n\nwhere formula_33 does not depend upon formula_2 because formula_35 depend only upon formula_36, which are independent on formula_37 when conditioned by formula_16, a sufficient statistics by hypothesis. Now divide both members by the absolute value of the non-vanishing Jacobian formula_27, and replace formula_40 by the functions formula_41 in formula_42. This yields\n\nwhere formula_44 is the Jacobian with formula_45 replaced by their value in terms formula_46. The left-hand member is necessarily the joint pdf formula_47 of formula_48. Since formula_49, and thus formula_50, does not depend upon formula_2, then\n\nis a function that does not depend upon formula_2.\n\nA simpler more illustrative proof is as follows, although it applies only in the discrete case.\n\nWe use the shorthand notation to denote the joint probability density of formula_54 by formula_55. Since formula_56 is a function of formula_57, we have formula_58, as long as formula_59 and zero otherwise. Therefore:\n\nwith the last equality being true by the definition of sufficient statistics. Thus formula_61 with formula_62 and formula_63.\n\nConversely, if formula_61, we have\n\nWith the first equality by the definition of pdf for multiple variables, the second by the remark above, the third by hypothesis, and the fourth because the summation is not over formula_66.\n\nLet formula_67 denote the conditional probability density of formula_57 given formula_69. Then we can derive an explicit expression for this:\n\nWith the first equality by definition of conditional probability density, the second by the remark above, the third by the equality proven above, and the fourth by simplification. This expression does not depend on formula_2 and thus formula_56 is a sufficient statistic.\n\nA sufficient statistic is minimal sufficient if it can be represented as a function of any other sufficient statistic. In other words, \"S\"(\"X\") is minimal sufficient if and only if\n\nIntuitively, a minimal sufficient statistic \"most efficiently\" captures all possible information about the parameter \"θ\".\n\nA useful characterization of minimal sufficiency is that when the density \"f\" exists, \"S\"(\"X\") is minimal sufficient if and only if\n\nThis follows as a direct consequence from Fisher's factorization theorem stated above.\n\nA case in which there is no minimal sufficient statistic was shown by Bahadur, 1954. However, under mild conditions, a minimal sufficient statistic does always exist. In particular, in Euclidean space, these conditions always hold if the random variables (associated with formula_75 ) are all discrete or are all continuous.\n\nIf there exists a minimal sufficient statistic, and this is usually the case, then every complete sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological case in which a complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic). While it is hard to find cases in which a minimal sufficient statistic does not exist, it is not so hard to find cases in which there is no complete statistic.\n\nThe collection of likelihood ratios formula_76 is a minimal sufficient statistic if formula_77 is discrete or has a density function.\n\nIf \"X\", ..., \"X\" are independent Bernoulli-distributed random variables with expected value \"p\", then the sum \"T\"(\"X\") = \"X\" + ... + \"X\" is a sufficient statistic for \"p\" (here 'success' corresponds to \"X\" = 1 and 'failure' to \"X\" = 0; so \"T\" is the total number of successes)\n\nThis is seen by considering the joint probability distribution:\n\nBecause the observations are independent, this can be written as\n\nand, collecting powers of \"p\" and 1 − \"p\", gives\n\nwhich satisfies the factorization criterion, with \"h\"(\"x\") = 1 being just a constant.\n\nNote the crucial feature: the unknown parameter \"p\" interacts with the data \"x\" only via the statistic \"T\"(\"x\") = Σ \"x\".\n\nAs a concrete application, this gives a procedure for creating a fair coin from a biased coin.\n\nIf \"X\", ..., \"X\" are independent and uniformly distributed on the interval [0,\"θ\"], then \"T\"(\"X\") = max(\"X\", ..., \"X\") is sufficient for θ — the sample maximum is a sufficient statistic for the population maximum.\n\nTo see this, consider the joint probability density function of \"X\"=(\"X\"...,\"X\"). Because the observations are independent, the pdf can be written as a product of individual densities\n\nwhere 1 is the indicator function.

Sometimes one can very easily construct a very crude estimator \"g\"(\"X\"), and then evaluate that conditional expected value to get an estimator that is in various senses optimal.\n\nAccording to the Pitman–Koopman–Darmois theorem, among families of probability distributions whose domain does not vary with the parameter being estimated, only in exponential families is there a sufficient statistic whose dimension remains bounded as sample size increases. Less tersely, suppose formula_150 are independent identically distributed random variables whose distribution is known to be in some family of probability distributions with fixed support. Only if that family is an exponential family there is a (possibly vector-valued) sufficient statistic formula_151 whose number of scalar components does not increase as the sample size \"n\" increases.\n\nThis theorem shows that sufficiency (or rather, the existence of a scalar or vector-valued of bounded dimension sufficient statistic) sharply restricts the possible forms of the distribution.\n\nAn alternative formulation of the condition that a statistic be sufficient, set in a Bayesian context, involves the posterior distributions obtained by using the full data-set and by using only a statistic. Thus the requirement is that, for almost every \"x\",\n\nMore generally, without assuming a parametric model, we can say that the statistics \"T\" is \"predictive sufficient\" if\n\nIt turns out that this \"Bayesian sufficiency\" is a consequence of the formulation above, however they are not directly equivalent in the infinite-dimensional case. A range of theoretical results for sufficiency in a Bayesian context is available.\n\nA concept called \"linear sufficiency\" can be formulated in a Bayesian context, and more generally. First define the best linear predictor of a vector \"Y\" based on \"X\" as formula_154. Then a linear statistic \"T\"(\"x\") is linear sufficient if\n\n\n"}
{"id": "301658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301658", "title": "Trolley problem", "text": "Trolley problem\n\nThe trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics. The general form of the problem is this:\nYou see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that controls a switch. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track. You have two options:\n\n\nWhich is the more ethical option?\nThe modern form of the problem was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, but also extensively analysed by Judith Thomson, Frances Kamm, and Peter Unger. However an earlier version, in which the one person to be sacrificed on the track was the switchman's child, was part of a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin in 1905, and the German legal scholar Hans Welzel discussed a similar problem in 1951.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the trolley problem and its variants have been used extensively in empirical research on moral psychology. Trolley problems have also been a topic of popular books. The problem often arises in the discussion of the ethics of the design of autonomous vehicles.\n\nFoot's original structure of the problem ran as follows:\n\nA utilitarian view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all). An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.\n\nThe trolley problem is a specific ethical thought experiment among several that highlights the difference between deontological and consequentialist ethical systems. The central question that these dilemmas bring to light is on whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the utility of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals.\n\nThe initial trolley problem also supports comparison to other, related, dilemmas:\n\nResistance to this course of action seems strong; when asked, a majority of people will approve of pulling the switch to save a net of four lives, but will disapprove of pushing the fat man to save a net of four lives. This has led to attempts to find a relevant moral distinction between the two cases.\n\nOne clear distinction is that in the first case, one does not intend harm towards anyone – harming the one is just a side effect of switching the trolley away from the five. However, in the second case, harming the one is an integral part of the plan to save the five. This is an argument which Shelly Kagan considers (and ultimately rejects) in his first book \"The Limits of Morality\".\n\nA claim can be made that the difference between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.\n\nAnother distinction is that the first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash into a heavily populated area. Even if the pilot knows for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area—people who are \"uninvolved\"—he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice your own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of one innocent person to save five people may be insufficient justification.\n\nThe further development of this example involves the case, where the fat man is, in fact, the villain who put these five people in peril. In this instance, pushing the villain to his death, especially to save five innocent people, seems not only morally justifiable but perhaps even imperative. This is essentially related to another thought experiment, known as ticking time bomb scenario, which forces one to choose between two morally questionable acts.\n\nThe claim that it is wrong to \"use\" the death of one to save five runs into a problem with variants like this:\n\nThe only physical difference here is the addition of an extra piece of track. This seems trivial since the trolley will never travel down it. The reason this might affect someone's decision is that in this case, the death of the one actually is part of the plan to save the five.\n\nThe rejoining variant may not be fatal to the \"using a person as a means\" argument. This has been suggested by Michael J. Costa in his 1987 article \"Another Trip on the Trolley\", where he points out that if we fail to act in this scenario we will effectively be allowing the five to become a means to save the one. If we do nothing, then the impact of the trolley into the five will slow it down and prevent it from circling around and killing the one. As in either case some will become a means to saving others, we are permitted to count the numbers. This approach requires that we downplay the moral difference between doing and allowing.\n\nHere is an alternative case, due to Judith Jarvis Thomson, containing similar numbers and results, but without a trolley:\n\nUnger argues extensively against traditional non-utilitarian responses to trolley problems. This is one of his examples:\n\nResponses to this are partly dependent on whether the reader has already encountered the standard trolley problem (since there is a desire to keep one's responses consistent), but Unger notes that people who have not encountered such problems before are quite likely to say that, in this case, the proposed action would be wrong.\n\nUnger therefore argues that different responses to these sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics – in this new case, he says, the only important difference is that the man in the yard does not seem particularly \"involved\". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not \"fair game\", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.\n\nUnger also considers cases which are more complex than the original trolley problem, involving more than just two results. In one such case, it is possible to do something which will (a) save the five and kill four (passengers of one or more trolleys and/or the hammock-sleeper), (b) save the five and kill three, (c) save the five and kill two, (d) save the five and kill one, or (e) do nothing and let five die.\n\nIn 2001, Joshua Greene and colleagues published the results of the first significant empirical investigation of people's responses to trolley problems. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, they demonstrated that \"personal\" dilemmas (like pushing a man off a footbridge) preferentially engage brain regions associated with emotion, whereas \"impersonal\" dilemmas (like diverting the trolley by flipping a switch) preferentially engaged regions associated with controlled reasoning. On these grounds, they advocate for the dual-process account of moral decision-making. Since then, numerous other studies have employed trolley problems to study moral judgment, investigating topics like the role and influence of stress, emotional state, impression management, levels of anonymity, different types of brain damage, physiological arousal, different neurotransmitters, and genetic factors on responses to trolley dilemmas.\n\nThe trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys in which approximately 90% of respondents have chosen to kill the one and save the five.\n\nA 2009 survey published in a 2013 paper by David Bourget and David Chalmers shows that 69.9% of professional philosophers would switch (sacrifice the one individual to save five lives) in the case of the trolley problem. 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer.\n\nProblems analogous to the trolley problem arise in the design of autonomous cars, in situations where the car's software is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action (sometimes including options which include the death of the car's occupants), all of which may cause harm. A platform called Moral Machine was created by MIT Media Lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm. Analysis of the data collected through Moral Machine showed broad differences in relative preferences among different countries . Other approaches make use of virtual reality to assess human behavior in experimental settings.\n\nIn 2016, the government of Germany constituted an ethical commission that addressed the implications of autonomous driving. As a result, the commission defined 20 rules for autonomous and connected driving, which will be obligatory for upcoming laws regarding the production of autonomous cars.\n\nIn an urban legend that has existed since at least the mid-1960s, the decision is described as having been made in real life by a drawbridge keeper who was forced to choose between sacrificing a passenger train and his own four-year-old son. There is a 2003 Czech short film titled \"Most\" (\"The Bridge\" in English) and \"The Bridge\" (US) which deals with a similar plot. This version is often given as an illustration of the Christian belief that God sacrificed his son, Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the 2010 video game \"Fable 3\", one of the earliest moral choices players make involves having to choose to execute either their childhood sweetheart or a crowd of protesters. If a decision is not made within a certain period of time, the king announces that the player has five seconds to make up their mind, \"or they all die.\"\nIn 2016, a Facebook page under the name \"Trolley Problem Memes\" was recognised for its popularity on Facebook. The group administration commonly shares comical variations of the trolley problem and often mixes in multiple types of philosophical dilemmas. A common joke among the users regards \"multi-track drifting\", in which the lever is pulled after the first set of wheels pass the track, thereby creating a third, often humorous, solution, where all six people tied to the tracks are or run over by the trolley, or are spared if the trolley derails.\n\nThe trolley problem forms the major plot premise of season 2 episode 5, \"The Trolley Problem\", of \"The Good Place\".\n\nIn a 2014 paper published in the \"Social and Personality Psychology Compass\", researchers criticized the use of the trolley problem, arguing, among other things, that the scenario it presents is too extreme and unconnected to real-life moral situations to be useful or educational. \n\nBrianna Rennix and Nathan J. Robinson of \"Current Affairs\" go even further and assert that the thought experiment is not only useless but downright detrimental to human psychology. The authors are opining that to make cold calculations about hypothetical situations in which every alternative will result in one or more gruesome deaths is to encourage a type of thinking that is devoid of human empathy and assumes a mandate to decide who lives or dies. They also question the premise of the scenario. \"If I am forced against my will into a situation where people will die, and I have no ability to stop it, how is my choice a “moral” choice between meaningfully different options, as opposed to a horror show I’ve just been thrust into, in which I have no meaningful agency at all?\"\n\n"}
{"id": "61701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61701", "title": "Venn diagram", "text": "Venn diagram\n\nA Venn diagram (also called primary diagram, set diagram or logic diagram) is a diagram that shows \"all\" possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. These diagrams depict elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. The points inside a curve labelled \"S\" represent elements of the set \"S\", while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set \"S\". This lends to easily read visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets \"S\" and \"T\", \"S\" ∩ \"T\", is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions \"S\" and \"T\". In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams, which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science.\n\nA Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an area-proportional or scaled Venn diagram.\n\nThis example involves two sets, A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents all living creatures that are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram. Living creatures that both can fly \"and\" have two legs—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the blue and orange circles overlap. It is important to note that this overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example creatures) that are members of both set A (two-legged creatures) and are also members of set B (flying creatures.)\n\nHumans and penguins are bipedal, and so are then in the orange circle, but since they cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one. Creatures that are not two-legged and cannot fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.\n\nThe combined region of sets A and B is called the \"union\" of A and B, denoted by . The union in this case contains all living creatures that are either two-legged or that can fly (or both).\n\nThe region in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the \"intersection\" of A and B, denoted by . For example, the intersection of the two sets is not empty, because there \"are\" points that represent creatures that are in \"both\" the orange and blue circles.\n\nVenn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by John Venn in a paper entitled \"On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings\" in the \"Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science\", about the different ways to represent propositions by diagrams. The use of these types of diagrams in formal logic, according to Frank Ruskey and Mark Weston, is \"not an easy history to trace, but it is certain that the diagrams that are popularly associated with Venn, in fact, originated much earlier. They are rightly associated with Venn, however, because he comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them\".\n\nVenn himself did not use the term \"Venn diagram\" and referred to his invention as \"Eulerian Circles\". For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, \"Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, even those who have made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance...\" Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) includes \"Venn's Method of Diagrams\" as well as \"Euler's Method of Diagrams\" in an \"Appendix, Addressed to Teachers\" of his book \"Symbolic Logic\" (4th edition published in 1896). The term \"Venn diagram\" was later used by Clarence Irving Lewis in 1918, in his book \"A Survey of Symbolic Logic\".\n\nVenn diagrams are very similar to Euler diagrams, which were invented by Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. M. E. Baron has noted that Leibniz (1646–1716) in the 17th century produced similar diagrams before Euler, but much of it was unpublished. She also observes even earlier Euler-like diagrams by Ramon Llull in the 13th Century.\n\nIn the 20th century, Venn diagrams were further developed. D. W. Henderson showed in 1963 that the existence of an \"n\"-Venn diagram with \"n\"-fold rotational symmetry implied that \"n\" was a prime number. He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when \"n\" is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for \"n\" = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist if and only if \"n\" is a prime number.\n\nVenn diagrams and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted in the curriculum of other fields such as reading.\n\nA Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in a plane. According to Lewis, the \"principle of these diagrams is that classes [or \"sets\"] be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not-null\".\n\nVenn diagrams normally comprise overlapping circles. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the elements of the set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all wooden objects, while another circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region or \"intersection\" would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes (cardinality) of sets; i.e. they are schematic diagrams.\n\nVenn diagrams are similar to Euler diagrams. However, a Venn diagram for \"n\" component sets must contain all 2 hypothetically possible zones that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion in each of the component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents \"dairy products\" and another \"cheeses\", the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context \"cheese\" means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.\n\nThe difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:\n\n\nThe Venn and the Euler diagram of those sets are:\n\nVenn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a simplex and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a tesseract (or the cells of a 16-cell respectively).\n\nFor higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find \"symmetrical figures...elegant in themselves,\" that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an \"elegant\" four-set diagram using ellipses (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for \"any\" number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.\n\nAnthony William Fairbank Edwards constructed a series of Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting the surface of a sphere, which became known as Edwards–Venn diagrams. For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (\"x\" = 0, \"y\" = 0 and \"z\" = 0). A fourth set can be added to the representation by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane to give \"cogwheel\" diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth, as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a stained-glass window in memory of Venn.\n\nEdwards–Venn diagrams are topologically equivalent to diagrams devised by Branko Grünbaum, which were based around intersecting polygons with increasing numbers of sides. They are also two-dimensional representations of hypercubes.\n\nHenry John Stephen Smith devised similar \"n\"-set diagrams using sine curves with the series of equations\n\nCharles Lutwidge Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) devised a five-set diagram known as Carroll's square. Jeremiah Joven Joaquin and Robert James Boyles, on the other hand, proposed supplemental rules for the standard Venn diagram in able to account for certain problem cases. For instance, regarding the issue of representing singular statements, they suggest to consider the Venn diagram circle as a representation of a set of things, and use first-order logic and set theory to treat categorical statements as statements about sets. Additionally, they propose to treat singular statements as statements about set membership. So, for example, to represent the statement “a is F” in this retooled Venn diagram, a small letter “a” may be placed inside the circle that represents the set F.\n\nVenn diagrams correspond to truth tables for the propositions formula_5, formula_6, etc., in the sense that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the truth table. This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph's R-diagrams.\n\n\n\n"}

The most commonly modeled systems are aeronautical, biological/medical, digital power, electric motor, electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, process, thermal/HVAC and econometric.\n\nA read-only version of the software, VisSim Viewer, is available free of charge and provides a way for people not licensed to use VisSim to run VisSim models. This program is intended to allow models to be more widely shared while preserving the model in its published form. The viewer will execute any VisSim model, and only allows changes to block and simulation parameters to illustrate different design scenarios. Sliders and buttons may be activated if included in the model.\n\nThe \"VisSim/C-Code\" add-on generates ANSI C code for the model, and generates target specific code for on-chip devices like PWM, ADC, encoder, GPIO, I2C etc. This is useful for development of embedded systems. After the behavior of the controller has been simulated, C-code can be generated, compiled and run on the target. For debugging, VisSim supports an interactive JTAG linkage, called \"Hotlink\", that allows interactive gain change and plotting of on-target variables. The VisSim generated code has been called efficient and readable, making it well suited for development of embedded systems. VisSim's author served on the X3J11 ANSI C committee and wrote several C compilers, in addition to co-authoring a book on C. This deep understanding of ANSI C, and the nature of the resulting machine code when compiled, is the key to the code generator's efficiency. VisSim can target small 16-bit fixed point systems like the Texas Instruments MSP430, using only 740 bytes flash and 64 bytes of RAM for a small closed-loop Pulse-width modulation (PWM) actuated system, as well as allowing very high control sample rates over 500 kHz on larger 32-bit floating point processors like the Texas Instruments 150 MHz F28335.\n\nThe technique of simulating system performance off-line, and then generating code from the simulation is known as \"model-based development\". Model-based development for embedded systems is becoming widely adopted for production systems because it shortens development cycles for hardware development in the same way that Model-driven architecture shortens production cycles for software development.\n\nModel building is a visual way of describing a situation. In an engineering context, instead of writing and solving a system of equations, model building involves using visual \"blocks\" to solve the problem. The advantage of using models is that in some cases problems which appear difficult if expressed mathematically may be easier to understand when represented pictorially.\n\nVisSim uses a hierarchical composition to create nested block diagrams. A typical model would consist of \"virtual plants\" composed of various VisSim \"layers\", combined if necessary with custom blocks written in C or FORTRAN. A virtual controller can be added and tuned to give desired overall system response. Graphical control element such as sliders and buttons allow control of what-if analysis for operator training or controller tuning.\n\nAlthough VisSim was originally designed for use by control engineers, it can be used for any type of mathematical model.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Law\n\nWestley Wallace Law (January 1, 1923 – July 29, 2002) was a civil rights leader from Savannah, Georgia. He was president of the Savannah chapter of the NAACP, where he led his community and made great strides in desegregation through nonviolent resistance from 1950 to 1976. After his time with the NAACP W. W. Law spent much of the rest of his life advocating for African-American history and culture in Savannah. To this end he established the Savannah-Yamacraw Branch of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, the Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum, the King-Tisdell Cottage Museum, the Beach Institute of African American Culture, and the Negro Heritage Trail Tour.\n\nW. W. Law was the only son and eldest of ten children born to Geneva Wallace and Westley Law. He began working at the age of ten to help his recently widowed mother while also attending school. In high school, Law joined the NAACP Youth Council and later served as the council's president while in college at Georgia State College. His college career was interrupted when he was drafted into military service in World War II. W. W. Law returned from the war and, with the help of the GI Bill, returned to college where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology.\n\nAfter graduation Law worked as a mail carrier for the U.S. Postal Service for more than forty years. His job with the Postal Service was endangered, however, when he was fired for his civil rights activism. President John F. Kennedy and the NAACP stepped in quickly upon hearing of Law's firing and he was reinstated in his job. Mr. Law retired from the Postal Service in 1990. Westley Wallace Law died on July 29, 2002 at his home in Savannah,Georgia.\n\n"}
